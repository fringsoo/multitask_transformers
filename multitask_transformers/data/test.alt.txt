Because you are using a word that already has a definition . Main Entry : mar·riage Pronunciation : \ & # 712 ; mer-ij , & # 712 ; ma-rij\ Function : noun Etymology : Middle English mariage , from Anglo-French , from marier to marry Date : 14th century 1 a ( 1 ) : the state of being united to a person of the opposite sex as husband or wife in a consensual and contractual relationship recognized by law Do you see Jews celebrating Christmas ? NO ! They already have a holiday that is defined . And I believe the only reason they added same sex marriage to Webster 's Dictionary is so not to make flamboyant gay men cry . I am not anti-gay , but I am sick of hearing about it . Your rights do not compare to that of a religious background or ethnicity . That 's like comparing an apple to a cardboard box . The only thing the 2 share is the fact that they are nouns . I agree that it should n't be voted on . That 's a waste of my tax dollar . Do you think I ask the government to give me attention because I JUST HAVE to watch Everybody Loves Raymond in hi def ? And you 're in the wrong category if you mention gay rights and civil rights in the same sentence . Civil rights are non political and gays are always protesting something that has to do with the government . I would also like to add that I think it 's tacky that gays ONLY vote for liberals just because they `` love the gays '' . Those people do n't give a # # # # about you . They say that because the Conservatives have n't and intend to get your vote . Voting for one political party over one issue seems morally wrong . You 're gay . Get over it . Move on ... ... ... .	WOW it comes down to this ; heterosexuals are given a privledge just because of who they are and who they love . Gay people are denied equal treatment to heterosexuals because of who they are and who they love . The way I understand this is that segregation deined blacks equal treatment to whites because of who they where . You would not deny that the latter is a civil rights issue but you can not bring yourself to see the former is also . Why is that ? So what you are saying is that it is ok to discriminate based upon sexual orientation but not race or religion ? Why ? When heterosexuality and homosexuality are treated equally and both are considered normal and acceptable then I will move on . There is nothing wrong with being gay , it is not a sin , and it is not immoral . Until being gay is considered equal to being a hetero then you will just have to continue being sick of hearing about it . I am sick of hearing evil funamenalists insult my family because of who we are . I am sick of being denied marriage because of someone elses privledge , and religious beliefs .

This fine upstanding pillar of the shooter community had a ccw permit .	So ? Last time I checked , MASS MURDER was against the law . Did n't care too much for following that one , did he ? This is like pointing out that the man who drove through a retirement community killing 3 elderly people and 2 grandchildren in a drunk driving accident was a liquor store owner . According to your logic , this would mean he was a drunk driver because he was a liquor store owner , therefore , all liquor store owners are drunk drivers . But according to my logic , instead of focusing on a mere `` feel good '' bit of information , I would look at the actual drunk driving records of liquor store owners . What if I found out that this was the only incident of a liquor store owner killing someone in the past 50 years ? Which is closer to the truth : Your assertion that liquor store owners are all dangerous because of this one incident , or mine that they are n't because of the actual facts ? The state of Virginia has no requirement for a CCW permit . CCW permits are available for request for those citizens who desire documentation in order to carry in other states . There have been over 225,000 permits issued in Virginia . This means : HOW MANY PEOPLE CARRY HAVING NOT REQUESTED A PERMIT ? ( We know at least 225,000 are carrying there because they have requested one ) ... ..let 's be conservative and say that half of them have done so . This means that over 50 % of gun carriers enjoy paperwork . My guess would be less than half desire documentation , but hey , I 'm gon na be conservative . So , over 500,000 people carrying CCW in Virginia everyday and one of them goes nuts . This means that CCW holders account for less than 1/10th of 1 percent of shootings in Virginia . ( It looks like this - < .01 % ) What 's the murder rate for the general population in Virginia , Penfold ? By stating that this one shooter had a CCW , are you trying to point out to us that the crime rate for CCW holders in Virginia is 20 times better than the general population , or 50 times better ? Maybe you 're trying to point out that it 's 75 times better ? Even if it 's only 10 times better ... ... ... .it is still better ( in multiples ) than NON CCW holders ! WHAT DO YOU FAIL TO GRASP ABOUT CCW HOLDERS COMMITTING SUBSTANTIALLY FAR FEWER CRIMES THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD ? ( BTW : This is just CCW holders in Virginia . Now go through the entire nation ! ... ... and you point out that one has committed a murder ! Wow ! That 's a real crime wave ! One out of millions and millions ! Whew ! Maybe if another CCW holder commits another murder in a few more years IT WILL BE A TREND ! )	disagree	sarc
Here is a list of Christian Clergy that is fighting the Fundamentalist anti-intellectualism and quite plainly accepting the fact that the theory of evolution has massive amounts of evidence for it . Within the community of Christian believers there are areas of dispute and disagreement , including the proper way to interpret Holy Scripture . While virtually all Christians take the Bible seriously and hold it to be authoritative in matters of faith and practice , the overwhelming majority do not read the Bible literally , as they would a science textbook . Many of the beloved stories found in the Bible  the Creation , Adam and Eve , Noah and the ark  convey timeless truths about God , human beings , and the proper relationship between Creator and creation expressed in the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation . Religious truth is of a different order from scientific truth . Its purpose is not to convey scientific information but to transform hearts . We the undersigned , Christian clergy from many different traditions , believe that the timeless truths of the Bible and the discoveries of modern science may comfortably coexist . We believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth , one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests . To reject this truth or to treat it as one theory among others is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children . We believe that among Gods good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our Creator . To argue that Gods loving plan of salvation for humanity precludes the full employment of the God-given faculty of reason is to attempt to limit God , an act of hubris . We urge school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge . We ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion , two very different , but complementary , forms of truth . from http : //www.uwosh.edu/colleges/cols/r ... laboration.htm Over 10,000 signatures of Christian Clergy have been collected , and have endorsed this letter .	Foolish Clergymen . How can this work ? How can you take something as serious as the supposed Holy word of God and say that ? I mean if you cant take something as simple as what is said in genesis and beleive it then why the XXXX would people beleive in anything else the bible has to say ? If there is falsehood in it then how can any of it be trusted ? If the Creation , Adam and Eve , Noah and the ark are just there to serve as the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation . That is Absolutly ridiculous . Why stop with that ? Why not continue on to say that the story of Jesus was jsut a way for man to relate to God ? Oh but then it continues doesnt it ? Yes it does ! Nothing in the bible is to be beleived unless it is all beleived as a whole . It is torn apart . You can not pick and choose parts of this religion as it fits your needs . It simply must be all or nothing . Otherwise you are wasting your time .	neutral	sarc

My contention is that shape and form is quickly molded in the first days , weeks , or months of life . For example , an animals diet can quickly shape his morphology , as in this tadpole example : [ snip misrepresentation for which supersport has already been busted on multiple boards ] ( Could this be why Neanderthals had their brow ridges ? Since they had a slightly protruding face ( as many in Europe still do ) , the exertion that no-doubt came from eating a diet heavy in meat ( vigorous chewing ) could very well have put pressure on the facial plates and brow ridges -- and as youngsters with soft bones , this diet help dictate their morphology . )	For any of you who missed it : Those soft bones can be molded in the first few `` days , weeks , or months , '' says sport , but Neanderthal infants got bony brow ridges because they were doing so much vigorous chewing . supersport also insists that Neanderthals were fully human . Last I checked , it took a long time for enough of a human 's teeth to erupt in order to vigorously chew meat . Once again , supersport has proposed an idea that we can test scientifically . All he has to do is secure guardianship of a newborn and feed said newborn a nice , healthy , high-in-protein diet requiring heavy chewing . If the child ends up looking like a Neanderthal , supersport will be vindicated . What are you waiting for , supersport ? Oh , I get it : you 're doing to do the peppered moth experiment first , right ? Then you 'll do the Great Dane × Chihuahua to produce Chihuahuas experiment . Only then will you get around to this one ... To respond to some of the other comments in this thread : supersport was eventually banned from IIDB for ignoring directions of moderators . While there , he averaged over 50 posts per day of trolling . His points were -- without fail -- repeatedly slapped down in the most convincing fashion imaginable : IIDB is crawling with experts in various fields , evolutionary and molecular biology certainly not excepted . Every time supersport 's argument would get slaughtered indisputably from countless angles , he 'd abandon the thread and start a new one , usually saying pretty much the same thing . supersport has said that nobody from there dares come over here to debate him . I know that Collin and I are both here and on IIDB ; the fact that the majority of the people over there make me look like a novice coupled with the fact that supersport has n't fared too well here should tell anybody who has any semblance of reasoning that supersport is once again talking out of his XXX . Do n't take his word for it , but you do n't have to take my word for it , either : head over to IIDB and do a search for threads started by supersport . It 'll only take the first couple of pages to see him thrashed , but I certainly wo n't stop you from reading more of the carnage .	neutral	sarc

The enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people . Rights Retained by the People Aside from contending that a bill of rights was unnecessary , the Federalists responded to those opposing ratification of the Constitution because of the lack of a declaration of fundamental rights by arguing that inasmuch as it would be impossible to list all rights it would be dangerous to list some because there would be those who would seize on the absence of the omitted rights to assert that government was unrestrained as to those . 1 Madison adverted to this argument in presenting his proposed amendments to the House of Representatives . ''It has been objected also against a bill of rights , that , by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power , it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration ; and it might follow by implication , that those rights which were not singled out , were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government , and were consequently insecure . This is one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard against the admission of a bill of rights into this system ; but , I conceive , that it may be guarded against . I have attempted it , as gentlemen may see by turning to the last clause of the fourth resolution . '' 2 It is clear from its text and from Madison 's statement that the Amendment states but a rule of construction , making clear that a Bill of Rights might not by implication be taken to increase the powers of the national government in areas not enumerated , and that it does not contain within itself any guarantee of a right or a proscription of an infringement . 3 Recently , however , the Amendment has been construed to be positive affirmation of the existence of rights which are not enumerated but which are nonetheless protected by other provisions .

WASHINGTON & # 8211 ; Supreme Court aspirant Sonia Sotomayor said Tuesday that she considers the question of abortion rights is settled precedent and says there is a constitutional right to privacy . The federal appeals court judge was asked at her confirmation hearing Tuesday to state how she felt about the landmark Roe versus Wade ruling legalizing abortion in 1973 . Sotomayor told the Senate Judiciary Committee that `` there is a right of privacy . The court has found it in various places in the Constitution . '' She said this right is stated in the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure and in the 14th Amendment guaranteeing equal protection of the law . She declined to say pointblank if she agreed with the high court 's precedent on this volatile issue . Answering a question later from Sen. Orrin Hatch , R-Utah , Sotomayor said that `` all precedents of the Supreme Court I consider settled law , '' subject to the possibility of subsequent reversal , such as when the court last month renounced a previous precedent in a reverse discrimination case . It ruled 5-4 on the side of white firefighters from New Haven , Conn. , who challenged a decision by the city to discard the results of an employee test in which they fared better than minorities who took the examination .

Well , the simple answer to this question is `` No it is not . '' Telling convention to shove it is not one of the main points of being gay , not in any way shape or form . Being gay is simply about the people one is attracted to , the people one loves , and the person one wants to spend his or her life with . Now this does not mean that these people do not tell convention to go shove it , but they do so only when they believe convention is unfair , unjust , unequal , and a detriment to happiness . On the issue of gay rights , most ( but maybe not all ) gay people believe that the specific convention of denying some rights to gay people is a bad one , so they stand against it .

It 's still a parasitic organism dependant on the host mother . You ca n't deny that .	Why do you want to approach in language of least-value of human life by reducing it in comparison to such things as a 'tumor ' ? Obviously a tumor is different simply on the basis that it wo n't be growing into a child and an adult soon ( actually , never ! ) . Why should the fact that something is going to soon grow into a child , adolescent , and adult not factor into whether or not life is valued ? Is the pro-choice position so weak that what is growing inside the mother has to be described in terms of a 'tumor ' ? Jo is right -- and yes , AA ; you should n't have to not value human life just to have the pro-choice position .

So strange !

I am sorry that someone near to you was attacked . I do not believe that the attack occurred simply because the attacker was illegal . As a matter of fact , all such attacks are illegal , unlawful , whether perpetrated by an `` illegal '' or anyone else . I hope that the attacker was brought to justice and punished .

Gun angle . Sinjin . This is not an Anti-union rant . This is a DC police , and Township police question . SEIU Service Employees Union International . In other words , all of the people involved are employed by the Government . That means they work for us . The Police are employed by us . The DC Police backed the SEIU , and the article said they were there to protect SEIU . And maybe even worse than that , is the fact that the township police were maybe either afraid of SEIU or were sympathetic to their goals . And Screw that ! ! ! ! ! ! They are employed to protect the people on that street . Otherwise , we have anarchy . But , it is a fact that , Everyone there is employed by us . However , if this not be the case , I asked for an explanation that makes sense . But , if this be true , and if it is n't brought under control , are we then supposed to then fear our very own police because maybe they belong to SEIU , or hope to join ? Or something ?

Political leaders should not oppose gay marriage at all .

I do n't think pro-choicers in general care whether or not abortion is truly rare . If they did they would put more effort into making sure it is rare , and not just legal .	I know you 're talking to Jessica , so I will only comment on this . It would be easier to make it rare if pro-life people were n't intent on making it illegal . Pro-choice people have to make it as available as possible to counter pro-life attempts to shut it down entirely . If pro-life people did n't exist , then the reasonable people could work towards making abortion rare . Take the current debates for example . My entire point is that it should not be illegal . That abortion should be available as a safe and legal choice ( it can only be really safe if it 's legal ) . We spend all our time and effort debating the legality that we spend no time on creating programs to help women choose to continue their pregnancies instead of having an abortion , legal or not .	neutral	notsarc

Many people would allow abortions in extreme cases because they figure that since extreme cases make up about 5 % of abortions then if they can get all but extreme cases then they will be saving at least 95 % , which is better than nothing .

Any person may refuse the Bible and the words and instead opt to make an affirmation . All that is necessary is to inform the judge that you prefer to do so . Everyone else may take the oath and then anyone who desires makes an affirmation . In the affirmation there is no `` swearing , '' merely a promise . The affirmation carries the same expectations and penalties as the oath . A friend did so in a court once . He did n't know what kind of reaction from the attorneys and judge to expect . He got no reaction whatsoever . The clerk just put down the Bible and administered the affirmation .

First of all , it 's not a precedent . this is the seventh or eighth state where a higher court has found anti-gay discrimination in marriage unconstitutional . Secondly , when so many rulings go in this direction , it can hardly be called `` lawlessness '' . It 's a call for lawful , constitutional interpretation of statutes . It takes extraordinary intellectual dishonesty to pretend there is some `` agenda '' at work . These decisions are the consequence of two things : our long history of rationally applying those silly words about equality that folks smarter than this generation of politicians put in the Constitution AND a long-term correction of the misunderstandings of what homosexuality IS and what its consequences are . I know you do n't personally believe it , but there is nothing wrong with us .	Hey , laws are just laws , they can be overturned by any activist judge . So what is there about marriage which is absolute ? If nothing , then anyone can marry anyone or anything , its just the whim of a judge which decides . That is where we are heading , and heading fast . These laws stop them for now . But even five years ago , no one would have believed that same-sex marriage could be legislated over the objections of the voters .

Creationism attempts to deny observable reality with the power of faith , while maintaining a logical façade . The only way to do this is to never follow any point through to it 's ultimate conclusion , as it will be shown as false . Instead , the best tactic is to attempt to bury opponents under an ever-shifting , ever-repeating argument in an attempt to persuade them that because you have so many arguments , you must be right - and because you never stay on-topic , none of your points are ever completely wiped of the map , so you can revisit them and force them to be debated from the start again . This is why the Index to Creationist Claims is so handy , because it allows most arguments to be wiped out from stage one . Hence my personal Creationist Challenge - if someone can come up with an argument for creationism that I can not answer with a single link to the Index , I will take that person seriously .

Originally posted by voiceofreason Well if you 're going to quote that article that mentions Canada to support your opinion , then does that mean you 're in favor of gun registration and licensing ? Canada has them . And if the NRA is really interested in enforcing laws why do they ask congress to reduce the budget of law enforcement ? The NRA uses its political muscle to make it easier for criminals to obtain guns . Robert Ricker , former top lawyer of the NRA , talks about it . So if you 're really interested in enforcing gun laws , do n't support the NRA .	`` What is true , Ricker says , is that gun manufacturers have long known that distributors and retailers supply thousands of guns each year to criminals , and yet gun makers deliberately look the other way. `` The quote says it all . That attitude breaks many cornerstone laws regarding personal responsibility . Manufactures are NOT responsible for customers illegal activity . GM and Ford know that 100 % of all the product they sell will be used illegally . Everyone of their cars will be used to break speed limits . No one obeys speed limts , the only time speed limits are obeyed is when a cop is watching . Yet GM and Ford are not responsible for all the illegal activity of their products . Shifting the responsbility for enforcement breaks many traditions and laws regarding individual personal responsibility . When a customer breaks a law using a product , manufactures are not responsible , that goes for both guns and cars , or any product that is sold and used for criminal purposes . There certainly a lack of cooperation between the ATF and the NRA . They really should be working together . It takes two sides to make a conflict . The ATF is trying to single out gun manufactures to be responsible for policing customers . NO OTHER INDUSTRY is being held accountable like that . That is why there is a conflict between the NRA and ATF . The NRA asks that gun manufactures to be treated with the same consideration of existing laws and standards applied to other industries . The NRA supports any efforts to take firearms away from criminals , but they are asking that gun manufactures not be held accountable for customer illegal activity . Which is the position of every single product manufacturer not matter what you make and sell . It is not that gun manufactures are looking away , they do . So does every other manufacture who makes any other product .	neutral	notsarc

A large fraction of the noncoding part of a eukaryotic genome is used to make RNA that is sufficiently stable in a cell to be detected by different technological approaches ( 14 ) . The biological significance of this pervasive transcription is unclear and controversial . One possibility is that only very short regions of such unannotated RNA are biologically relevant ( 5 ) . In-depth characterization of RNAs as to their subcellular compartmentalization , size , modifications , and genomic origins can potentially provide clues to their functions . This study reports two general observations derived from the maps of nuclear and cytosolic polyadenylated [ poly ( A ) + ] RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides ( nt ) ( long RNAs , lRNAs ) and whole-cell RNAs less than 200 nt ( short RNAs , sRNAs ) over the entire nonrepetitive portion of the human genome . First , the potential biological function of an appreciable portion of long unannotated transcripts is to serve as precursors for sRNAs . Second , these maps reveal three classes of RNAs that have specific genomic localization at gene boundaries . Biological relevance of these classes of RNAs is supported by strong correlation with the expression state of genes they associate with , as well as their syntenic conservation between human and mouse .	Those who care enough to read the above and understand what the authors have studied will hardly jump on the bandwagon and declare that Genes are Dead .	neutral	notsarc

Perhaps an analogy . Lets say for the sake of the argument you do not smoke or drink ( personally against it , for whatever reason ) .

But you can not prove a negative . Which is also why you wo n't be able to prove that creationism is wrong , and why we ca n't prove evolution is wrong . The focus must be on proving one right . How you might do that depends on your method of reasoning and thought .	It 's bad enough that you claim to oppose evolution when you do n't even know what it is , but to correct someone on logic and get it backwards is really silly . If you limit your claims of creation to the simple assertion , `` God did it ! '' without any specifics as to how , then you have answered no questions and explained nothing . Such empty assertions can not be proven wrong . Such an assertion says nothing about the methods used by God , and that is what scientists study . There are lots of scientists , evolutionary biologists among them , who believe in a Creator God . Science is not a matter of proving something right . Scientific theories are explanations of the processes and mechanisms that account for the facts that have been observed . In science , the facts are the observations . The process of science is a process of testing those theories , again and again . The body of scientific knowledge is composed of tested theories that have NOT been shown to be wrong . The more a theory has been tested , the more secure it is , even to the point that it is no longer doubted by those who are informed about the topic . How many physicists do you think there are that doubt the the earth orbits the sun ? Is that a fact ? How many nuclear physicists doubt the existence of atoms or electrons ? Why is it that all creationists seem to be so ignorant of science that they think a theory is some sort of wild guess and that if they are `` proven '' they will grow up to be facts ? Did it ever occur to any of you that you should actually learn about the topic before you try to instruct others ? One thing that is always true of science is that it is predictive - and `` God did it '' offers no predictions . However , if you wish to assert that ancient mythology is a historical record of the events , you have made assertions that can be checked . For example , if you assert that the creation took place about 6 to 10 thousand years ago , then we can predict that nothing in the entire universe can be older than that . But clearly there are . And we have observed events that happened longer ago than that . For example , SN 1987 A was a supernova that was observed in 1987 within 3 hours of the first light reaching earth . It 's distance from earth has been measured by more than one method . It is 170,000 light years away . In other words , SN 1987 A exploded 170,000 years ago . A creationist 's answer is to claim that his god created the light already on its way to earth , complete with the history of an explosion that never happened . Ultimately , creationism falls back on an untestable miracle for which there is no evidence . So if you want to believe in miracles and mythology , great ! But if you wish to argue science , then should n't you at least learn what it is ? If you claim that a theory is wrong should n't you at least know what that theory is ? By the way , I am getting the definition of evolution from memory . I have been using it for many years . It was first stated some 70 or 80 years ago . Anyone who has taken a course in evolutionary biology heard a similar definition the first day of class . Any text on evolutionary biology or that has a chapter on evolution will have a similar definition . It is common knowledge - and that 's why I ask , if you do n't know what evolution is , how do you know that you are opposed to it ?	disagree	sarc

My girlfriend and I have been debating this subject a lot lately .

Last night , after two or three evenings of this stuff back and forth ( after I resoundingly bested her on every point , basically ) she affirmed that she does believe in evolution and has `` kind of '' always believed in evolution , but that she has many reservations and questions about it . The pattern ? `` Solid support of creationism turns into an admission that evolution is the truth , but with reservations . '' I find that pattern a little bit amusing . Last night , she had abandoned most of her philosophical objections because I made the concession that everyone has to make if they want to make any headway whatsoever with a budding evolutionist who ca n't let go of their religious objections : `` Okay , maybe it had God 's stamp of approval . '' When you say that , you can move on to a real conversation . In this case , she bombarded me with a million questions that I could n't answer . She seemed excited about it , not debating , but asking me about the wonders of biology with a long series of `` ... but what about this '' and `` ... what about that '' type of questions . One thing she keyed on was evolution as it applies to a larger ecosystem . I could n't quite grasp what she was asking because I do n't think she herself was very clear on the question , but to make a long story short , I got the distinct impression that she simply ca n't wholeheartedly accept evolution because she ca n't begin to fathom the complexity of the science behind it . I have told her time and time again : `` Just because you do n't understand something , that does n't make it wrong . '' I see this same pattern here in your words , Frog . You 're talking about wild collisions of atoms and saying that the foundations who donate hundreds of millions of dollars a year to research know less than you do , because they 're wasting their money . You 're making this subject so much bigger and more philosophical than it has to be , Frog . Is evolution by far the best answer we have to the question of the diversity of species ? The answer is yes , overwhelmingly so . Everything else is moot . It belongs elsewhere .	disagree	notsarc

Barack Obama promised change . Then he took on one of Washington 's toughest issues : health care . During his first year in office , he found himself making one deal after another with Capitol Hill 's powerful insiders -- lobbyists and influential members of Congress . He angered his political base , watched his popularity sink , and nearly failed to pass the bill . In Obama 's Deal , FRONTLINE follows the story of the president 's historic victory and offers the first in-depth look at how the Obama administration operates . Veteran FRONTLINE producer Michael Kirk ( Bush 's War , Dreams of Obama , Inside the Meltdown ) provides a sobering view inside Obama 's deals and reveals the realities of American politics , the power of special interest groups , and the role of money in policy making . FRONTLINE : Coming Soon - Obama 's Deal | PBS	I am understanding the show will also cover how single payer advocates were not allowed a seat at the discussion table , and how , a year ago today , they were arrested at the Senate Finance Committee hearing for nevertheless speaking out in challenge to Max Baucus .

The church is unfit to rule on abortion because it acts on what benefits them or they 're ideas . Like what I quoted , saying that `` Thou shalt not kill . '' Thousands of not millions of people are killed in wars . The Crusades is an example . It does not say `` Thou shalt not kill except when trying to claim territory or to land or if the person being killed disagrees with you religiously . '' It does n't say that . The church seems to decide when it will follow it 's rules , and when not . Yes , war is sometimes a neccessary method of self defense , but the many of the Crusades were not neccessary . Most of them were failures , but Christianity is still the second biggest religion in the world ( if not the first ) . The church ca n't be allowed to rule on abortion when they disregard their own laws . Like the above quote , why is the church trying to stop abortion when they would consider one to be alive after taking a breath . if you were to look at it from a scientific standpoint , the individual ovum and sperm are living cells , but they die all the time and no one cares . An embryo or fetus is something starting to develop into a human and that ca n't be stopped without killing it or injecting differnt DNA , but it 's still not too different from sperm and ovum . If you ca n't trust the church to make fair decisions and follow values and morals and rules they put in place , how can you expect an honest good decision about anything from it .	Cahuella , The Crusades ( for the most part ) were a justified reaction to Muslim aggression . If you would like to see a recent discussion of this then go to the `` Compromise '' thread on this forum and see what Simone and I discussed . As to the sperm and egg being a thing very similar to a fertilized egg..I think that may be a bit of a simplification . As to the Church making fair decisions , I believe it does . That 's why it distinguishes an order of morality with degrees of goodness and badness . That 's why a war may be permissable but an abortion is not . Parcum , glad to see you back .

Now settle down charlie , and try to think rationally , just for a second . Have you ever heard of a tumor growing into a sentient life form as a fetus does ? I 'd appreciate a link documenting such an occurrence so we pro-lifers can start planning save the tumor rally 's .	Archangel is right on this one . It 's completely absurd to compare a tumour to a healthy fetus , which has a separate blood system , and in a relatively short space of time will be an independent person . It does no service to the pro-choice lobby to display the sort of attitude that says `` we do n't value human life '' . If you think abortion is an acceptable moral choice then you have to make a case either that the fetus is not human , is not an individual , is not alive , or is in some other way not worthy of respect . Or you have to make a case that ending it 's life is in some way justifiable in spite of these things . I am pro-choice , but only because I do n't believe you can legislate about an issue like this unless there is near unanimity . The suffering and anguish caused by banning abortion is substantial and should not be dismissed , but equally when abortion is legal it should not be seen as a substitute for contraception . How to achieve this is a difficult one , without causing psychological harm to women who feel they must make that choice .	neutral	notsarc

Are rights a useful framework at all ?	Yes . A proper understanding of rights is neccessary to know when you are aggressing against another person . Most children learn about rights intuitively through social interaction , a child take 's another child 's toy `` That 's mine '' , they say , they may fight over it , but they learn that when people lay contrary claims to things , violent conflict is the result . It is useful to refine this intuitive belief system into something consistent , both individually , and in shaping the law of a society . A society in which people work together through trade and friendship will always be more prosperous and safe than one in which rights are systematically ignored and violent conflict is the norm . It is not useful to talk about rights with people who treat them as subjective , based on value judgements , ie `` People have a right to life , because life is more valuable than being able to have an abortion '' , or `` People have a right to have an abortion , because being able to have an abortion is more important than a fetus '' . There is nothing to debate , we may as well go over whether strawberry or chocolate is a better flavour for a milkshake . In a free society we can disagree over what is `` more important '' and make our own choices , but if value judgements are used to determine law , the only possible outcome is the oppression of those with minority values . No argument can be made about value judgements , they do not convince anyone , they do not provide just solutions . Politically , to demand your values be enforced ( by virtue of your political power ) is to demand the rule of force rather than justice . There are only two choices : The rule of law , justice , a free society , built on the moral foundation of individual rights - or the rule of the majority , built on the arbitrary value judgements and preferences of those weilding power .	neutral	notsarc

It 's just the same flip flopping over and over . Depending on the argument , `` science does n't exclude the divine '' , { then switcharoo } , `` science proves there is no divine . '' Just depends on the setting of the argument . ( you do have your copy of Victor Stenger 's book ; God - The failed Hypothesis / how science shows that God does not exist , do n't you ?	Look , marc , I 'm really tired of spelling this out for you . So I 'll do it once more , bookmark this post , and then link you to it every time you pretend to be so terribly persecuted again . Science is incapable of testing the supernatural . Period . By the very mechanism of science -- methodological naturalism -- no conclusions about the supernatural can be drawn . However , when claims of the supernatural overlap into the natural realm , then those claims can be tested . Science tells us that there was no global flood a la Noah , not that there is no God . Now , if you choose to interpret that as a reasonable person and realize that science shows that `` a Noah 's flood-causing God '' does not exist , then kudos . This does not mean that there is no God whatsoever . The error you are making is that you are equating creationism with God . We 've disproved special creation . Handily . So one might say that there 's good evidence that a God represented by a literal interpretation of the Bible does not exist . But that does n't mean that no God exists , or that a Christian God does n't exist . Then again , if you 've pigeonholed God into a constrictive box based on your own understanding , but you insist that God exists , perhaps you should rethink why you felt the need to cram your God into a tiny box . Science can only disprove a God to whom some human attributes a limitation .	disagree	sarc

CHICAGO  Observed in the wild and tested in captivity , chimpanzees invite comparison with humans , their close relatives . They bear a family resemblance that fascinates people , and scientists see increasing evidence of similarities in chimp behavior and skills , making some of them think on the vagaries of evolution . For some time , paleontologists and evolutionary biologists have known that chimp ancestors were the last line of todays apes to diverge from the branch that led to humans , probably six million , maybe four million years ago . More recent examination shows that despite profound differences in the two species , just a 1.23 percent difference in their genes separates Homo sapiens from chimpanzees , Pan troglodytes . And certain similarities between the two species , scientists say , go beyond expressive faces and opposable thumbs . Chimps display a remarkable range of behavior and talent . They make and use simple tools , hunt in groups and engage in aggressive , violent acts . They are social creatures that appear to be capable of empathy , altruism , self-awareness , cooperation in problem solving and learning through example and experience . Chimps even outperform humans in some memory tasks .	Well then . You stand corrected . Now it just remains to be seen if you 'll admit you are wrong . History is n't betting on it .	neutral	sarc

The proof is in the pudding.. I suggest that you read my post again and let me know if you disagree with any of my opinions . If not , then you have to come to the conclusion that God does not exsist ... God 's only exsistance in the minds of believers just as was the case with believers of different Gods throughout human history . I do not understand what you are referring to when you said , `` just admit you are a faith based preacher , as bad as any fundamentalist '' ? By the way it should be ovious that I am an atheist .

claiming to be 'just like me ' detracts from that argument . claiming to be 'just like everyone else ' would work , and i 'll assume you meant something like that ( if you want to know why , read some of my other posts ) . this also goes against roughly 1/3rd of the philosiphies of the gay couples i know and commonly associate with- those philosiphies being 'hey ! sex is for pleasure , and if you 're trying to avoid having kids the best way is to **** the same sex as yourself ! '	Well , I would not make the claim that anyone is just like anyone else , but I would make the claim that gay people are just as likely to be good people as anyone else . Now , I would wager that I know far more gay people than you do . I wager this only because I am in a variety of gay rights organizations , as well as other gay-friendly organizations . I also have many gay friends outside of these organizations . I know of none being sexually promiscuous , though perhaps some are doing it behind my back . I know of many who do believe that sex is for pleasure , but an equal , if not greater percentage of heterosexuals who also believe sex should be used for pleasure . Further , I know a number of very promiscuous heterosexuals . Yet we let those heterosexuals marry . In truth , I see no reason not to . Lots of people of all sexual orientations believe that sex should be used for pleasure , not just children . This fact is a religious / moral belief , and it does not make these people bad parents , nor does it make these people bad people , nor does it make these people less in need of the benefits of marriage should they decide to start a family . If we are going to give marriage to some people , it is inexcusable to deny that marriage to others who are in equal need of it . If you would like others to respect your status as a husband ( or wife , or whatever you would prefer that I refer to you as ) , then you must be willing to respect the marriage of others in return .	neutral	notsarc
No Electrolyte , science lies ! here is the undisputed truth : Noah and his three sons traveled the globe , collected two representatives of each species ( or seven of each clean species depending on the chapter ) . They crammed these critters in a sea worthy vessel made exclusively of gopher wood . The gopher wood was structurally sound enough to support the weight of said critters . The ark floated about like a cork for 40 days , etc whereupon the cargo was released to repopulate the world to present population levels . Meanwhile , there must have been provisions on the Ark for marine animals and fish as the rainwater would have undoubtedly altered the water pH and saline content . Also not mentioned is the fact that Noah and sons must have collected seeds from every PLANT on earth because I am personally not aware of many plant types that can survive completely submerged for 40 days . So you see , it is much harder to believe in a fossil record and sediment deposit stratigraphy , than in a giant boat crammed to the gills full of elephants , octopus , and cacti . I hope I cleared this up for everyone . We have found fossils , but they are all fake . We have not found an ark .but it is real .	If you read this as if he is talking sarcastically it is quite funny . good argument against himself . What he is suggesting is hilarious ... just thinking about three ( or whatever ) amount of people collecting all the non-flood-live-able species in the world and putting them on a vessel is very immaginative and quite frankly impossible ... as I 've said before , get real .	neutral	sarc
obrotion became populer in the 1800 and thats oround the time evoluion became populer . and the lie that the embro has gill slits .	Evolution was n't introduced until 1859 . When did abortion become popular ? The industrial revolution occurred in the 1800s . Maybe that was the cause of abortion 's alleged popularity . Grover Cleveland was elected in the 1800s . Clearly he had something to do with the alleged increase in abortion 's popularity . The American Civil War occurred in the 1800s . It must have been the impetus for the rise in popularity of abortion . A human embryo does have features that look like gill slits . They are not gills but pharyngeal clefts .

A PRACTICAL MAN 'S PROOF OF GOD The existence of God is a subject that has occupied schools of philosophy and theology for thousands of years . Most of the time , these debates have revolved around all kinds of assumptions and definitions . Philosophers will spend a lifetime arguing about the meaning of a word and never really get there . One is reminded of the college student who was asked how his philosophy class was going . He replied that they had not done much because when the teacher tried to call roll , the kids kept arguing about whether they existed or not . Most of us who live and work in the real world do not concern ourselves with such activities . We realize that such discussions may have value and interest in the academic world , but the stress and pressure of day-to-day life forces us to deal with a very pragmatic way of making decisions . If I ask you to prove to me that you have $ 2.00 , you would show it to me . Even in more abstract things we use common sense and practical reasoning . If I ask you whether a certain person is honest or not , you do not flood the air with dissertations on the relative nature of honesty ; you would give me evidence one way or the other . The techniques of much of the philosophical arguments that go on would eliminate most of engineering and technology if they were applied in those fields . The purpose of this brief study is to offer a logical , practical , pragmatic proof of the existence of God from a purely scientific perspective . To do this , we are assuming that we exist , that there is reality , and that the matter of which we are made is real . If you do not believe that you exist , you have bigger problems than this study will entail and you will have to look elsewhere . THE BEGINNING If we do exist , there are only two possible explanations as to how our existence came to be . Either we had a beginning or we did not have a beginning . The Bible says , `` In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth '' ( Genesis 1 :1 ) . The atheist has always maintained that there was no beginning . The idea is that matter has always existed in the form of either matter or energy ; and all that has happened is that matter has been changed from form to form , but it has always been . The Humanist Manifesto says , `` Matter is self-existing and not created , '' and that is a concise statement of the atheist 's belief . The way we decide whether the atheist is correct or not is to see what science has discovered about this question . The picture below on the left represents our part of the cosmos . Each of the disk shaped objects is a galaxy like our Milky Way . All of these galaxies are moving relative to each other . Their movement has a very distinct pattern which causes the distance between the galaxies to get greater with every passing day . If we had three galaxies located at positions A , B. and C in the second diagram below , and if they are located as shown , tomorrow they will be further apart . The triangle they form will be bigger . The day after tomorrow the triangle will be bigger yet . We live in an expanding universe that gets bigger and bigger and bigger with every passing day . Now let us suppose that we made time run backwards ! If we are located at a certain distance today , then yesterday we were closer together . The day before that , we were still closer . Ultimately , where must all the galaxies have been ? At a point ! At the beginning ! At what scientists call a singularity ! A second proof is seen in the energy sources that fuel the cosmos . The picture to the right is a picture of the sun . Like all stars , the sun generates its energy by a nuclear process known as thermonuclear fusion . Every second that passes , the sun compresses 564 million tons of hydrogen into 560 million tons of helium with 4 million tons of matter released as energy . In spite of that tremendous consumption of fuel , the sun has only used up 2 % of the hydrogen it had the day it came into existence . This incredible furnace is not a process confined to the sun . Every star in the sky generates its energy in the same way . Throughout the cosmos there are 25 quintillion stars [ a meaningless number , given that only some of the universe is visible ] , each converting hydrogen into helium , thereby reducing the total amount of hydrogen in the cosmos . Just think about it ! If everywhere in the cosmos hydrogen is being consumed and if the process has been going on forever , how much hydrogen should be left ? Suppose I attempt to drive my automobile without putting any more gas ( fuel ) into it . As I drive and drive , what is eventually going to happen ? I am going to run out of gas I If the cosmos has been here forever , we would have run out of hydrogen long ago ! The fact is , however , that the sun still has 98 % of its original hydrogen . The fact is that hydrogen is the most abundant material in the universe ! Everywhere we look in space we can see the hydrogen 21 cm line in the spectrum_a piece of light only given off by hydrogen . This could not be unless we had a beginning ! A third scientific proof that the atheist is wrong is seen in the second law of thermodynamics . [ Oh , Christ , not this one again ] In any closed system , things tend to become disordered . If an automobile is driven for years and years without repair , for example , it will become so disordered that it would not run any more . Getting old is simple conformity to the second law of thermodynamics . In space , things also get old . Astronomers refer to the aging process as heat death . If the cosmos is `` everything that ever was or is or ever will be , '' as Dr. Carl Sagan is so fond of saying , nothing could be added to it to improve its order or repair it . Even a universe that expands and collapses and expands again forever would die because it would lose light and heat each time it expanded and rebounded . The atheist 's assertion that matter/energy is eternal is scientifically wrong . The biblical assertion that there was a beginning is scientifically correct . THE CAUSE If we know the creation has a beginning , we are faced with another logical question_was the creation caused or was it not caused ? The Bible states , `` In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth . '' Not only does the Bible maintain that there was a cause_a creation_but it also tells us what the cause was . It was God . The atheist tells us that `` matter is self-existing and not created . '' If matter had a beginning and yet was uncaused , one must logically maintain that something would have had to come into existence out of nothing . From empty space with no force , no matter , no energy , and no intelligence , matter would have to become existent . Even if this could happen by some strange new process unknown to science today , there is a logical problem . In order for matter to come out of nothing , all of our scientific laws dealing with the conservation of matter/energy would have to be wrong , invalidating all of chemistry [ Physics , XXXXX ] . All of our laws of conservation of angular momentum would have to be wrong , invalidating all of physics . All of our laws of conservation of electric charge would have to be wrong , invalidating all of electronics and demanding that your TV set not work ! ! Your television set may not work , but that is not the reason ! In order to believe matter is uncaused , one has to discard known laws and principles of science . No reasonable person is going to do this simply to maintain a personal atheistic position . The atheist 's assertion that matter is eternal is wrong . The atheist 's assertion that the universe is uncaused and selfexisting is also incorrect . The Bible 's assertion that there was a beginning which was caused is supported strongly by the available scientific evidence . THE DESIGN If we know that the creation had a beginning and we know that the beginning was caused , there is one last question for us to answer -- what was the cause ? The Bible tells us that God was the cause . We are further told that the God who did the causing did so with planning and reason and logic . Romans 1:20 tells us that we can know God is `` through the things he has made . '' The atheist , on the other hand , will try to convince us that we are the product of chance . Julian Huxley once said : We are as much a product of blind forces as is the falling of a stone to earth or the ebb and flow of the tides . We have just happened , and man was made flesh by a long series of singularly beneficial accidents. The subject of design has been one that has been explored in many different ways . For most of us , simply looking at our newborn child is enough to rule out chance . There are Modern-day scientists like Paul Davies and Frederick Hoyle , and others , that are raising elaborate objections to the use of chance in explaining natural phenomena . A principle of modern science has emerged in the 1980s called `` the anthropic principle . '' The basic thrust of the anthropic principle is that chance is simply not a valid mechanism to explain the atom or life . If chance is not valid , we are constrained to reject Huxley 's claim and to realize that we are the product of an intelligent God . THE NEXT STEP We have seen a practical proof of God 's existence in this brief study . A flood of questions arise at this point . Which God are we talking about ? Where did God come from ? Why did God create us ? How did God create us ? All of these and many more are answered in the same way_by looking at the evidence in a practical , common sense way .

basically , something with logical necessity must exist in every reality , including ours	If this thread is intended to be read only by those with a technical expertise in logical analysis , then my low-tech approach will make you groan . However , I 'm still puzzled by the idea that `` logical necessity must exist in every reality '' when this idea is applied to a particular problem . I can see that interior to logical reasoning , `` necessity '' must exist in every reality - otherwise what we understand as `` logic '' would not be that but something else . To simplify : All my friends are Irish Sheila is my friend So Sheila is Irish . ( The same sort of logical necessity applies ( I think ) to propositions involving mathematics : 6+2 = 8 can not be refuted because 6+2 is just another way of writing 8 . ) As Sheila exists in the real world , the information about her contained in the syllogism also happens to be factually true . But the necessary truths of logic including the proposition that God exists , are deduced from applying the rules of logic and are not necessarily factual truths and seem to have the same status as Sheila would if she existed only as an idea .	neutral	sarc

You say that my moral code is a code that puts faith only in myself . That is not true . I very openly acknowledge that if I never had input from the outside - moral codes which were presented to me with the reasons behind them - then my moral code as determined solely by myself would have been meager indeed . I have had a wide range of influences which have helped determined my moral code :	You gave a list here . What is your reasoning for believing they are true ? Because it makes sense to you ? Well mine makes sense to me . Why is it that when I state mine comes from an outside source it is unreasoned but when yours is somewhat developed from outside sources it is not ? In the end , you have a moral code developed by you whether influenced by the outside or not . It therefore puts faith in yourself and lends itself to be compromised . I can even relate this to the accounting world We have something called segregation of duties . It basically is used so you have more accountability . In my case , I have a moral code outside of my control . I have to be accountable to that . In your case you are only accountable to yourself and thus it is fairly easy to change the moral code to suit some self desires . This is a bit of a tangent so lets move on The main point is , your code still works on some level of blind faith as you claim mine does . I freely admit mine is blind faith and I only wish others would admit to theirs as well . Just think of it as you ca n't prove anything you can only assume certain things and make calls based upon those very basic assumptions .	disagree	notsarc

Also I think life was an accident and I resent that some people use this to conclude that I have no moral standards . I can not rationally justify my ethics using my beliefs but so what ?	Well , where do you get your beliefs about right and wrong from ? I mean , I know that you have moral standards and are most likely an ethical person . Sandycane does have a point in her previous message to you . It is just that I think that the main point was that you have no basis for believing what you believe to be true about morals and ethics because you have no one who tells you what is right and wrong , you must choose them and put them into practice for yourself . You have what I call `` relative morality '' . This is where people decide for themselves what is `` right '' and what is `` wrong '' . However , Chirstians believe that there is what I call an `` absolute morality '' . This absolute morality comes from our Creator God who sets the rules and morals that govern all people . I had a small debate about this with the bootfitter in another section on abortion . I do n't think that Sandycane was not pointing out that you have no morals , they just are n't absolute , i.e . you get to choose them for yourself . You may indeed have exactly the same morals and values that I have , but you still have `` relative morality '' as you have choosen those yourself . I have the `` absolute morality '' as I believe and try to put into action what God has revealed through His Word , the Bible , e.g . love your enemies . I will admit it , I do n't always succeed , but I do my best .	neutral	notsarc
You should also note that the one scenario I think the death penalty is acceptable for is if they try to escape using violence or if they attack another prisoner .

But it was immediately denounced by members of the Metropolitan Police Authority ( MPA ) , the body which governs the actions of Scotland Yard , which was apparently not consulted on the controversial decision . One MPA member described the move as `` totally unacceptable '' while another called for an emergency meeting . Joanne McCartney said : `` We want fewer guns on the streets not more , and people to feel safe in their community  not scared of those who are supposed to protect them .	So let 's look at the facts . In the UK there 's a continual fear of the people being armed , so pervasive and paralyzing in nature , that it extends even to the police being armed . You fear your own neighbors , you fear your own police officers . You insist that absolutely nobody can be trusted without extensive background checks and letters of reference of character , and even then you still do n't trust people . And yet you claim that this society of fear , this overwhelming distrust of absolutely everyone , is somehow the better society , the safer society .

I think we are talking about different things . A belief in adam and eve is not the same as being a good christian . The disbeleif in adam and eve can not DIRECTLY be used as a excuse to murder . Also did hitler talk about anything else other than keeping bloodlines pure ? Because these ideas to rely on the main theme of darwins origin of the species , in your quote you show how darwin states that eugenics is just an obvious consequence of the facts of animal husbandry .	A belief in Adam and Eve is a fundamental necessity to being a Christian at all . Jesus Christ believed in Adam and Eve , after all He created them . Gen 5:2 Male and female created he them ; and blessed them , and called their name Adam , in the day when they were created . [ Adam means man ] These arevthe words of Jesus Christ . You will notice He refers to the Old Testement as History . Mat 19:4 And he answered and said unto them , Have ye not read , that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female , Mat 19:5 And said , For this cause shall a man leave father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife : and they twain shall be one flesh ? Mat 19:6 Wherefore they are no more twain , but one flesh . What therefore God hath joined together , let not man put asunder . Mat 19:7 They say unto him , Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement , and to put her away ? Mat 19:8 He saith unto them , Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives : but from the beginning it was not so . Joh 1:1 In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God . Joh 1:2 The same was in the beginning with God . Joh 1:3 All things were made by him ; and without him was not any thing made that was made . Joh 1:4 In him was life ; and the life was the light of men . Joh 1:5 And the light shineth in darkness ; and the darkness comprehended it not . Joh 1:6 There was a man sent from God , whose name was John . Joh 1:7 The same came for a witness , to bear witness of the Light , that all men through him might believe . Joh 1:8 He was not that Light , but was sent to bear witness of that Light . Joh 1:9 That was the true Light , which lighteth every man that cometh into the world . Joh 1:10 He was in the world , and the world was made by him , and the world knew him not .

The problem here is that Christians ( such as I am ) consider the Bible to be Proof . I would be interested in seeing where you get your statistics that most births are impossible and most end in c-section . The women 's body begins preparing for birth from the minute she becomes pregnant . There are hormones released that allow for the cartilage to soften which allows the pelvis to spread as the child is born . Yes , birth is hard on the woman 's body , but personal responsibility comes into play . You did the deed , you do n't punish another for it . I am honestly torn on this one . Though I can see where it would be almost impossible for a woman to live with this , much less have a child that comes from this foul deed , I still do n't see where the child is to blame for the rape , thus it should not be punished . Much used and abused argument . Ca n't really be proven or disproven until it is tested , so I am not sure there is an argument . This is dramaticized by Hollywood leftists in movies and TV , so it has become this seemingly powerful point . Still not seeing where millions of children should be punished for the likely much fewer women who will seek abortion if it is made illegal . I would rather they overscreen than underscreen . I agree . I do not agree this means kill more babies . That is about as humanistic as you can get ( besides killing handicapped children ) . It all leads into a big , black hole . Religion influences all laws . Without that influence , there would be no laws . Note : humanism is also a religion !	# 1 See the post titled `` Biblical Failures '' in the Religion section of this forum . If the Bible has a single inaccuracy in it , then it can not be considered 100 % true . This post shows inaccuracies so the Bible can not be considered a reliable source for things that can not be proven and that includes trying to say whether an unborn baby has a soul . Besides , why should you be able to force your beliefs on everyone else ? Perhaps you could justify a law that says all Christians can not have abortions . # 2 A child who is unborn is not being punished by having its life ended . Even if you believe in the Bible , the child is going to simply ascend to heaven without having to suffer here on earth . If you do believe in the Bible and do n't believe this above fact , then you are saying that God will punish the child for being aborted . # 3 Your moronic statement about how there would be no laws without religion discredits your writings anyways . Laws do not stem from religion . They stem from the need for a society to be able to function properly . They stem from mans desire for power . Some do stem from religion but this does not make up the majority . If you wish to try and debate this , why not explain how religious influenced the laws concerning driving on a specific side of the road more than social influences did . # 4 Getting back to the abortion debate , what do you have against abortions ? Assuming you can not simply get off by saying the Bible says this or religion says that , what else can you say ? The fact is that abortion does not affect you . You can preach about abortion being bad and even protest it , but why should you try and force your beliefs on others ? I know this is the essence of Christianity , but why should it extend to society ? Pro-choice at least lets people decide what is best from them and the child . Can you honestly say it is better for a child to be born and mistreated and/or under fed until it dies than it is for a child to simply be aborted ?	neutral	notsarc

28c . Clinic workers commonly prey on fear , pain , and confusion to manipulate women into getting abortions .	While 'commonly ' may or may not be true , this does end up happening at least some of the time ( and possibly a lot of the time ) . It 's highly doubtful that clinic workers do this with ill-intent ... for example , a woman enters a clinic because she 's confused and thinking about getting an abortion ... she wants to consider the option of abortion , though she 's not really comfortable with the idea . The clinic worker assures the woman that abortion is a painless procedure , and that lasting psychological effects rarely ( if ever ) occur . The clinic worker may ask the woman to think about how having a child would interfere with the woman 's life . I 'd encourage you to read the book `` Forbidden Grief '' by Theresa Burke . It is a fascinating look at real women who have had abortions , and the experiences they have gone through . Some of the women described in the book feel that they were manipulated by clinic workers into having an abortion .

One other point . The beauty of science is that it 's based on repeatable evidence . If I do a nifty experiment I can describe it to you , and you can do it yourself . If you do n't get the same results then my conclusions are suspect . One of the defining characteristics of the supernatural is that it does n't work on demand . So while convincing evidence might appear once , it 's unlikely to appear again . This does n't automatically mean that the supernatural is n't real , or that the original evidence is bogus . It does mean that scientific methods are n't necessarily the right tools to use to judge the supernatural . Science deals with laws , with constants . The supernatural is by definition a bit more flaky .	One can not have a controled experiment , as one can in the hard sciences . Psychology , anthropology and other disciplines also do not allow for controlled experiments . However , as with these other fields , one can do a detailed analysis of events that do occur to see if there is a common trend . For example , if people claim to see a supernatural event , take them aside separately to question them about the details . If one can be sure that they did n't get a chance to coordinate the details ahead of time and , nevertheless , the details match , then that would be evidence supporting the supernatural . If this happens consistently , then it would start giving strong support to the existence of a supernatural . Unfortunately , though there are occasional events that remain unexplained , we all know that the great majority of events have not resulted in any conclusive evidence of a supernatural and often they are shown to be simply fraudulent or due to psychological misinterpretation . Since so many of these claims about the supernatural have proven to be dead ends , it is understandable that people should automatically be wary of anyone 's claim toward supernatural proof , which has led to the very subject being essentially taboo in intellectual circles . That is unfortunate . If there actually was a supernatural and did manifest itself , then it might never be discovered because any genuine evidence presented would be automatically ignored because of the taboo . The main challenge is to have the patience to weed through the thousands of bogus claims in the hope of finding something genuine - whether or not that hope ever gets fulfilled .	neutral	notsarc

Why do women opt for abortion over adoption ?	When contraception failed in my monogamous long term relationship , I heavily researched both options , as well as parenting . I looked into requirements for Medicaid , WIC , and other subsidized assistance offered in my community . I called a few clinics around town . That 's an interesting story , but not for here . I had heart to heart talks to many different people with different viewpoints . I decided to have an abortion because I was sick all the time . I had diagnosed migraine headaches constantly , and my seizure disorder that had laid dormant for years returned . I could n't leave my house . I lost my job . I was in the middle of my education ( it was early summer ) and if I continued my pregnancy it would have put me back a semester , thus costing thousands of dollars . The father did not want me to continue the pregnancy because he was concerned about my physical health . Just thinking about that time period makes me nauseated . I understood the merits of adoption , especially since my father was adopted . I talked to my aunt about adoption and foster care , since she has participated in both . I also thought about parenting , the love and all the things I have to offer . I knew that the father would have supported my decision to parent , I knew that our financial hardships could be dealt with , and I knew that my education could be continued later . I came to the conclusion that abortion was the best choice for me and my health . I appreciate that some may find this decision selfish , and essentially it is , since it was made with my best interests in mind . I would also hope that even if they consider it selfish , they understand the reasons why I made that decision . And if it was your wife , daughter , friend , and she was dealing with what I was , you would not expect her to continue a pregnancy .	neutral	notsarc
You think most people would incorporate the golden rule ? I do n't think so -- I think most people are willing to make a buck off of others ( business ventures ) , land that job they want before someone else gets it , curse someone for cutting them off in traffic , get that parking spot before the guy coming around the corner gets it , or even get in an intentionally insulting dig to someone in a discussion forum such as this . The examples could go on and on ... I think a lot of people like to THINK they incorporate the golden rule , but at close , honest examination would find that they rarely do .	The golden rule is not just one sided . It does not expect us to do all giving and no taking . I have expectations of how others should treat me ( the taking part ) but , to be consistent , I should realize that they have expectations of me ( the giving part ) . Though people may want to win out in a job interview over someone more qualified , most do n't morally expect that that should happen since they realize that that expectation would not be fair . They may make a buck off of a person but , unless they are con artists who lie to get that buck , most will do it in a way they consider fair , under laws they themselves would be willing to live under . ( As a side note : Even most con artists might admit that , if they themselves were conned , then they would have deserved it for being suckers . ) The rule of treating others as we would want or expect to be treated does n't necessarily lead to a hugely generous society - just to one that seems to minimize suffering in a realistically achievable way .	neutral	notsarc

The thing is , though , that if marriage is privatized people can have freedom without `` redefining the standard .

Based on threads I 've been reading here , there is a real tendency among some of the pro-choicers to portray pregnancy as a horrible thing that cause women to suffer -- that it is somthing bad or undesirable . - How could the opportunity to bring a life into the world , a wonderful miracle , be so awful by default ? Rather than bring into this peripheral thoughts to the question , such as rights and legal issues ( which are discussed at length here already in other threads ) , I 'd love to hear straightforward relelvant answers to this . I am also already aware that pregnancy can sometimes involve complications or that it can at times cause financial constraints . But I am mainly interested in seeing why there is a default tendency in pro-choice arguments to argue from the standpoint of pregnancy being a bad thing . Any thoughts ?	Pregnancy involves risk . While opting to undertake risk for a worthwhile objective is fine , to compel someone to take that risk is not . Obviously some pregnancies are undesirable , when unplanned or especially when the result of rape or incest . Besides , something that almost any woman can do is hardly a `` miracle '' .

Yes I am defining a human being by personhood because Im saying a human being is more than a clump of cells with DNA .

One could easily say that the heart is when life begins , because the heart is what all living things have . However , where's the evidence ? There is very little if any .

I can agree with legalizing Marijuana , but it is very similar to alcohol . Your reaction time is slowed down considerably . Before being legalized , there needs to be a test , similar to the BAC test . It should n't be illegal to smoke marijuana , but it should be the same as alcohol ; you ca n't smoke and drive .	But you can drink and drive , you just can not be intoxicated over a certain limit and drive . There is no test possible in the field ( like a breathylizer used for alcohol ) that would allow for testing of THC levels . It should be like anything else , if you are causing a problem or showing visible signs of impairment , you get detained and taken for further testing , which they can actually draw a THC level on you in a lab . And since you bring it up , marijuanna does not slow down reaction times near as much as alcohol . Alcohol is far more physically impairing than even high doses of THC .	neutral	notsarc

Thank you for your reply kelvin90701 . I will give my thoughts on all of your points soon , for now , I am just leaving , so I will just inquire as to what you mean on part of your post . Specifically , the following : The WMD analogy is poor . You will not find any vendors . Please find another one . There may be Constitutionally poor arguments in favor of banning WMDs for civilians , that argument is moot . You will not find any vendor . The Constitution protects my right to own arms . That does not mean arms vendors must be forced to sell thier product to me if I want one . That argument is moot . So , what you are saying , is there is no constitutional protection given to the manufacturer of weapons . That is , it would be constitutional to ban the manufacture of guns ? If so , would it still be OK , for an American citizen to buy any weapon that they would want from a foreign government/manufacturere , etc ? Again , thank you for your response . -Dan	Again that is a poor analogy . Congress does not have any powers NOT included in the Constitution . Quite the opposite , it specifically says that any powers NOT included in the Constitution is defaulted to the states and Congress is additionally prohibited from taking any more authority NOT named in the Constitution . Since there is no specific naming article saying Congress does not have the power to ban manufacturing weapons , in fact it DOES NOT . According to the 10th Amendment : The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people . Thus you have another poor analogy . Congress DOES NOT have the right to ban manufacture of guns .	neutral	notsarc

But Governor Palin does n't think so : http : //www.dailykos.com/story/2008/1 ... /97/640/631928	What typical leftist simone quality propaganda . What 's this victims name ? If she 's a real victim and willing to make an ad , why not give her name to personalize her message ? And are you actually suggesting that it 's ok to justify the killing of at least 1.3 million other babies per year because less than 1 % of the women who get abortions were raped ? HERE 'S the 1 % statistic . And Here 's searching beyond the myths . Rape , Incest and Abortion : Searching Beyond the Myths David C. Reardon , Ph.D. `` How can you deny an abortion to a twelve-year-old girl who is the victim of incest ? '' complains an indignant supporter of abortion . `` And how can you call yourself a loving Christian if you would force a victim of violent rape to give birth to a rapist 's child ? '' Every pro-lifer has heard these same challenges in one form or another . They are the emotionally charged questions designed to prove either 1 ) that pro-lifers are insensitive `` fetus lovers , '' 2 ) or ethically inconsistent , allowing abortion for some circumstances but not others . Unfortunately , most pro-lifers have difficulty answering these challenges because the issue of sexual assault pregnancies is so widely misunderstood . Typically , both sides of the debate accept the presumption that women with sexual assault pregnancies would want an abortion and that the abortion would in some way help them to recover from the assault . Thus , the pro-lifer is left in the uncomfortable position of arguing that the sanctity of life is more important than the needs of the sexual assault victim with whom everyone should rightly sympathize . But in fact , the welfare of the mother and child are never at odds , even in sexual assault cases . Both the mother and child are helped by preserving life , not by perpetuating violence . The reason most people reach the wrong conclusion about abortion in cases of rape and incest is that the actual experiences of sexual assault victims who became pregnant are routinely left out of the debate . Most people , including sexual assault victims who have never been pregnant , are therefore forming opinions based on prejudices and fears which are disconnected from reality . For example , it is commonly assumed that rape victims who become pregnant would naturally want abortions . But in the only major study of pregnant rape victims ever done , Dr. Sandra Mahkorn found that 75 to 85 percent chose against abortion.1 This evidence alone should cause people to pause and reflect on the presumption that abortion is wanted or even best for sexual assault victims . Several reasons are given for not aborting . First , approximately 70 percent of all women believe abortion is immoral , even though many also feel it should be a legal choice for others . Approximately the same percentage of pregnant rape victims believe abortion would be just another act of violence perpetrated against their bodies and their children . Second , some believe that their child 's life may have some intrinsic meaning or purpose which they do not yet understand . This child was brought into their lives by a horrible , repulsive act . But perhaps God , or fate , will use the child for some greater purpose . Good can come from evil . Third , victims of assault often become introspective . Their sense of the value of life and respect for others is heightened . They have been victimized , and the thought that they in turn might victimize their own innocent child through abortion is repulsive . Fourth , at least at a subconscious level , the victim may sense that if she can get through the pregnancy , she will have conquered the rape . By giving birth , she can reclaim some of her lost self-esteem . Giving birth , especially when conception was not desired , is a totally selfless act , a generous act , a display of courage , strength and honor . It is proof that she is better than the rapist . While he was selfish , she can be generous . While he was destroying , she can be nurturing . If giving birth builds self respect , what about abortion ? This is a question which most people fail to even consider . Instead , most people assume that an abortion will at least help a rape victim put the assault behind her and go on with her life . But in jumping to this conclusion , the public is adopting an unrealistic view of abortion . Abortion is not some magical surgery which turns back time to make a woman `` un-pregnant . '' Instead , it is a real life event which is always very stressful and often traumatic . Once we accept that abortion is itself an event with ramifications on a woman 's life , then we must carefully look at the special circumstances of the pregnant rape victim . Will an abortion truly console her , or will it only cause further injury to her already bruised psyche ? In answering this question , it is helpful to begin by noting that many women report that their abortions felt like a degrading and brutal form of medical rape.2 This association between abortion and rape is not hard to understand . Abortion involves a painful examination of a woman 's sexual organs by a masked stranger who is invading her body . Once she is on the operating table , she loses control over her body . If she protests and asks for the abortionist to stop , she will likely be ignored or told : `` It 's too late to change your mind . This is what you wanted . We have to finish now . '' And while she lies there tense and helpless , the life hidden within her is literally sucked out of her womb . The difference ? In a sexual rape , a woman is robbed of her purity ; in this medical rape she is robbed of her maternity . This experiential association between abortion and sexual assault is very strong for many women . It is especially strong for women who have a prior history of sexual assault , whether or not she is presently pregnant as the result of an assault.3 This is just one reason why women with a history of sexual assault are likely to experience greater distress during and after an abortion than other women . Second , research shows that after any abortion , it is common for women to experience guilt , depression , feelings of being `` dirty , '' resentment of men , and lowered self-esteem . What is most significant is that these feelings are identical to what women typically feel after rape . Abortion , then , only adds to and accentuates the traumatic feelings associated with sexual assault . Rather than easing the psychological burdens of the sexual assault victim , abortion adds to them . This was the experience of Jackie Bakker , who reports : `` I soon discovered that the aftermath of my abortion continued a long time after the memory of my rape had faded . I felt empty and horrible . Nobody told me about the pain I would feel deep within causing nightmares and deep depressions . They had all told me that after the abortion I could continue my life as if nothing had happened . '' Those encouraging abortion often do so because they are uncomfortable dealing with rape victims , or perhaps out of prejudice against victims whom they see as being `` guilty for letting it happen . '' Wiping out the pregnancy is a way of hiding the problem . It is a `` quick and easy '' way to avoid dealing with the woman 's true emotional , social and financial needs . According to Kathleen DeZeeuw , `` I , having lived through rape , and also having raised a child 'conceived in rape , ' feel personally assaulted and insulted every time I hear that abortion should be legal because of rape and incest . I feel that we 're being used by pro-abortionists to further the abortion issue , even though we 've not been asked to tell our side . '' The case against abortion of incest pregnancies is even stronger . Studies show that incest victims rarely ever voluntarily agree to an abortion.4 Instead of viewing the pregnancy as unwanted , the incest victim is more likely to see the pregnancy as a way out of the incestuous relationship because the birth of her child will expose the sexual activity . She is also likely to see in her pregnancy the hope of bearing a child with whom she can establish a true loving relationship , one far different than the exploitive relationship in which she has been trapped . But while the incest victim may treasure her pregnancy because it offers her hope of release , and the hope of finding a nurturing love , her pregnancy is a threat to the exploiter . It is also a threat to the pathological secrecy which may envelop other members of the family who are afraid to acknowledge that the abuse is occurring . Because of this dual threat , the victim may be coerced into an unwanted abortion by both the abuser and other family members . For example , Edith Young , a 12-year-old victim of incest impregnated by her stepfather , writes twenty-five years after the abortion of her child : `` Throughout the years I have been depressed , suicidal , furious , outraged , lonely , and have felt a sense of loss ... The abortion which was to 'be in my best interest ' just has not been . As far as I can tell , it only 'saved their reputations , ' 'solved their problems , ' and 'allowed their lives to go merrily on . ' ... My daughter , how I miss her so . I miss her regardless of the reason for her conception . '' Abortion providers who ignore this evidence , and neglect to interview minors presented for abortion for signs of coercion or incest , are actually contributing to the young girl 's victimization . They are not only robbing the victim of her child , they are concealing a crime , abetting a perpetrator , and handing the victim back to her abuser so that the exploitation can continue . Finally , we must recognize that the children conceived through sexual assault also have a voice which deserves to be heard . Julie Makimaa , conceived by an act of rape , works diligently against the perception that abortion is acceptable or even necessary in cases of sexual assault . While sympathetic to the suffering her mother endured at the hands of her attacker , Julie is also rightfully proud of her mother 's courage and generosity . Regarding her own view of her origin , Julie proclaims : `` It does n't matter how I began . What matters is who I will become . '' That 's a slogan we can all live with .	disagree	sarc

What is that Pesky word in the Constitution & # 8217 ; s Bill of Rights again ? Oh Yeah , now I remember . Due Process ! So the writers of this bill chooses not only to deny one , of their 2nd Amendment right , but also their 14th Amendment right as well .	Actually , the Second Amendment does n't say anything about due process . It does not say that people on a terror watch list can not be prohibited from buying weapons , but the right can be infringed with due process of law . In fact , the Second Amendment says nothing about the circumstances under which it can be infringed . One scholar comments on the implications of this for the individual rights interpretation : `` If read as an individual right , criminals , convicted felons , pirates , or revolutionaries could all be armed in the District of Columbia or in the federal territories . Pirates could load up their ships on the Potomac River and sail out to sea . Hunters could trample through Yellowstone or some other national park , guns in hand . [ 185 ] Anyone might board a plane , gun in hand , or carry a weapon into Congress , the White House , or any other federal building ... The Fifth Amendment allows the taking of liberty under some circumstances , while the Second , if read as an individual right , does not . '' Chicago-Kent Law Review 18th Century Pennsylvania , which had its own RKBA , passed a law which required citizens to take an oath of allegiance to the state or face being disarmed . This was to protect the state against those who might be loyal to the British Crown . So why ca n't the US take similar measures to protect itself against terrorists ?	disagree	notsarc
If all life evolved from a common ancestor , then there should be countless instances of new body parts evolving . Body parts such as eyes , muscle , bone , etc . We have not seen one instance of a new body part evolving in a population in which it has not existed previously . Evolutionists will wave the magic `` time wand '' and simply claim that such a change could never be observed in a few decades . What about fruit flies ? One generation of fruit flies = around a day . Fruit flies were exposed to x rays to speed up mutation rates , we have observed the equivalent of millions of years ( in terms of human generations ) of super-accelerated mutation and ... . no new body parts . Evolutionists will also list in steps how a new body part can arise . This is only plausible if each of those steps could be directly observed . If not , then it is nothing more than science fiction . Evolutionists have been searching for any direct evidence of the theory of evolution since the 1800 's . They are still looking .	in defense of the fruit fly , why would one evolve when one is already suited well to their environment ? what good does a 7th leg do ? and about the experiment itself - please , ALWAYS post references . who did the experiment ? when ? under what conditions ? how ? assuming you were correct about the experiment , were variables put in place such as habitat changes to reflect the timeline you speak of , a large variety of fruit flies to begin with , random mating , etc etc or did some people just shoot some x rays at a couple fruit flies , did some arithmetic which was probably wrong and called it that ? and im sorry , but there is mountains of direct evidence for evolution , you just need to go and look at it .	neutral	notsarc

the questions were not actually questions , but demands . Only projects one type of response . One we try to stay away from here at this forum .	okay ... maybe he was a little pushy , but it made me wonder about this issue . I looked at some of the links presented by creationists ; a book that attacks evolutionary biology by an electrical engineer , and a long rant about a false dichotomy established by evolutionists where they will reject any theory that does n't correspond to a philosophy of naturalism . The latter ( http : //www.trueorigin.org/creatheory.asp ) actually presented one aspect of a theory of creation . That being that all creatures started off with all the genetic information they needed and that observed change in animals is a degredation of information . This runs counter to evolutionary theory that simple unicellular organisms with simple DNA eventually became more complex . This is actually a decent claim , in the sense that it is a model that can be examined ... and quickly thrown out for obvious reasons ( antibiotic resistance , why are all creatures on earth so similar in genetic makeup ) I was wondering if anyone could bolster this claim or present another theory of creation . Really , unless some kind of theory is presented , all you are doing is bashing evolution . I can bash the laws of motion too ( not well , though ) but it does n't disprove them . Perhaps I 'm a little pushy too , but I find it annoying when truth is replaced with ... other things .	neutral	notsarc

Originally posted by FreeThinker Does the term `` evolution '' refer to ONLY the `` advances '' of life over time ?	The word `` evolution ' '' generally means change , not `` advance '' , so we can speak of `` stellar evolution '' or the evolution of a planetary surface . These are each large fields of science with many people studying them . The `` biological Theory of Evolution '' is completely different . From my viewpoint coming from the physical sciences , at the present time , the `` Theory of Evolution '' , which is the study of how genetic material changes over time , has become so completely validated by making so many accurate and useful predictions , that it can now just be considered biology . What most creationists seem to be disputing is just science , since they do n't specify , and use the term `` evolution '' too broadly .	neutral	notsarc
Yes . I already explained that . An hypothesis is made that explains an observation . Then a prediction is made that can only be true if the hypothesis is true . Then an experiment is designed or a situation established that can test if the prediction is true . They could . I suppose it has been done . I know of one case where anole lizards were transplanted to islands where they did n't exist . Based on previous observation of the lizards in their environment , predictions were made about the physiological changes that should be observed . Those changes were observed . Darwin himself noted the changes induced in domestic animals by the intent of breeders . This is now known as artificial selection . Do n't know . Have you tested your hypothesis ? The debate is n't whether , but how much . Is most evolution gradual as Darwin finally decided ? Or do populations tend to remain relatively constant as long as the environment remains constant ( as noted by Darwin in his notebooks ) ? Good questions . You seem to think that science knows all the answers rather than being a process of looking for answers . There is debate because we are still gathering data about very complex processes . That 's how science works . That 's what the debate is about , sharing ideas with each other .	Well is this serious science or is this ring-around-the-rosie on Sesame Street ? Am I just supposed to play make-believe and/or use my imagination ? I can do that -- for instance , when I play with my kids , I 'm real good at playing the role of `` Ken '' when we imagine that `` Barbie goes to the beach '' Surely the fossil record shows gradualism or not . I bought a book a while back at a half-price bookstore from Niles Eldredge . He says the following about gradualism : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Change in this manner ( gradualism ) is just not found in the fossil record . pg . 48 Darwin invented the myth that species were not real to convince the world of the nonmyth that evolution had occured . pg . 52 Darwin 's prediction that long-term evolutionary change should produce a systematic pattern of gradual , progressive change in the fossil record was faulty . pg . 53 As we have seen in the previous chapter , the usual conception casts evolution as a gradual , steady process of adaptive change . And we have already seen that the fossil record conflicts with that view . pg . 57 We 're faced more with a great leap of faith -- that gradual , progressive , adaptive change underlies the general pattern of evolutionary change we see in the rocks -- than any hard evidence . pg . 57 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I guess I would consider myself more of a PE guy than a gradualist simply because of what the fossils indicate . It seems to me that instead of evolving gradually that animals evolve quickly -- like the spiders on my shed . ( do you find it odd that they emerged yellow in the spring ? ) It seems butterflies have this same ability ... ..Evolution sure is amazing ! For instance , Monteiro said , the darker wing patterns that show up in butterflies that emerge in the spring serve to warm up the butterfly faster , whereas butterflies that emerge in the summer have lighter colors . `` Also , many butterflies that emerge in the wet season in the tropics have large , conspicuous marks on their wings that deflect the attacks of predators while the butterflies are actively finding mates and laying eggs , while the dry-season cohorts are very cryptic , trying to blend in with their environment and not attract any attention from predators until the rains arrive again , '' she said http : //unisci.com/stories/20021/0313021.htm	disagree	sarc

Next time you eat a hamburger , let 's arrest you for accessory to murder , after all , killing a cow is just as illegal as killing humans , at least according to your logic . As for the word `` gay '' , it started as an insult towards the homosexual community . Similarly to `` nigger '' , it was adopted by the very people it insulted to take some of the power out of the word . Now , with that said , I do NOT belittle the racist struggle by making that comparison . I know that the African-Americans have struggled thru much more than the homosexual community .

Founding Fathers * George Mason : `` I ask , who are the militia ? They consist now of the whole people , except a few public officers . `` 145 * Virginia Constitution , Art . I , Sec . 13 ( 1776 ) : `` That a well-regulated militia , composed of the body of the people , trained to arms , is the proper , natural , and safe defense of a free State ; that standing armies , in time of peace , should be avoided , as dangerous to liberty ... . '' * Richard Henry Lee : `` To preserve liberty , it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms , and be taught alike , especially when young , how to use them ... . The mind that aims at a select militia [ like the National Guard ] , must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle . `` 146 2 . U.S. Congress * The Militia Act of 1792 . One year after the Second Amendment was added to the Constitution , Congress passed a law defining the militia . The Militia Act of 1792 declared that all free male citizens between the ages of 18 and 44 were to be members of the militia . Furthermore , every citizen was to be armed . The Act stated : `` Every citizen ... [ shall ] provide himself with a good musket , or firelock , a sufficient bayonet and belt , two spare flints ... .

There can be little doubt from this that when the Congress and the people spoke of the a 'militia , ' they had reference to the traditional concept of the entire populace capable of bearing arms , and not to any formal group such as what is today called the National Guard . `` 148 * Current Federal Law : 10 U.S.C .

This is a statement written by someone who obviously has not read scripture . One of the most astonising `` proofs '' if you will , that the Bible is of supernatural origin , is predictive prophecy . Science can not , as you claim , `` explain '' everything , and it has no natural explanation for the predictions made in scripture . How can science explain through statistical probablity the over 600 prophecies in Biblical writings that have come to pass ? Also , how can it explain how supposedly uneducated people ( uneducated in the ways of modern science ) wrote about astronomy as if they knew about the universe as we do today . How could they have described the hydrological cycle as we have only come to know it recently ? Ecclesiastes 1:6 The wind goes toward the south , And turns around to the north ; The wind whirls about continually , And comes again on its circuit . How did they know that the earth `` hangs on nothing '' when the accepted norm of the day did not even accept that possibility ? Job 26:7 He stretches out the north over empty space ; He hangs the earth on nothing . How did they know that the `` vapors '' of the earth rise to create moisture , that is seeded by lightning with nitrogen and then falls as rain to fertilze the soil ? Jeremiah 10:13 When He utters His voice , There is a multitude of waters in the heavens : And He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth . He makes lightning for the rain , He brings the wind out of His treasuries. Hydrothermal vents [ 4 ] are described in two books of the Bible written before 1400BCmore than 3,000 years before their discovery by science . Genesis 7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noahs life , in the second month , the seventeenth day of the month , on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up , and the windows of heaven were opened . Even though the Bible is not a scientific text book and does n't purport to be , nowhere is it scientifically inaccurate . In addition , many of the scientific ideas you are so impressed with are nothing new to the Bible . It was speaking of these things long before modern science spoke of them . The story goes `` They ( scientists ) are slowly working their way to the mountain 's peak painstakingly measuring and analyzing every step that they take . After many years of research , they finally arrive at the top of the mountain , scale over its leading edge , only to find a group of theologians sitting there with the answers all along .

How are they going to pay for this ? Oregon hardly has the money to properly fund its school systems much less pay for a universal healthcare system .	I do n't know anyone on the committees , but people I know who have taken a look at the initial proposal and understand the current Oregon public health program ( manages Medicaid and other fed/state health funds ) say it 's financially feasible by the proposal to combine current private policy subscriptions ( including civil service at all levels other than federal ) and fed/state/muni contributions . I 'm told the key will be deductibles and how they scale them . Oregon 's schools ( excluding rural designations ) would have plenty of money if educator unions did n't have funding in a stranglehold . Word is that unless benefits and retirement now equaling private sector CEO levels are n't cut back the system will crash within the next decade . Off-topic , but civil service pay and benefits are an upcoming US crisis . Unions have switched from ruining manufacturing industries to the public sector .

The pro-life argument quite plainly revolves around the premise that fetuses are human beings , and therefore have a right to life . However , many ( if not all ) pro-lifers say that they will allow abortions in the `` extreme cases '' of rape or incest . Now , what does that imply ? Rape/incest fetuses are n't human beings , while others are ? Pro-lifers say that they do n't want the government picking and choosing who has the right to life and who does n't , but this sounds like picking and choosing to me . I think this inconsistency effectively nullifies the pro-life argument . Of course , to get rid of the inconsistency , the pro-lifers can bring rape and incest babies into the sphere of protected beings . The result - a horribly unreasonable position I ca n't suport .	Many people would allow abortions in extreme cases because they figure that since extreme cases make up about 5 % of abortions then if they can get all but extreme cases then they will be saving at least 95 % , which is better than nothing . After that they can work towards stopping all abortions . It 's a step-by-step process . I say abortion of all kinds should be illegal . 95 % of abortions are a result of consentual sex . We should n't cater to the 5 % just because they 've had a tough situation . I sympathize with them and would do what I could to help them , but they do still need to have the baby , whether they give it up for adoption or not . This is n't a horribly unreasonable position . It 's just a difficult position . Saying it 's alright to kill a baby for any reason is a horribly unreasonable position . People need to face the facts too . Sex is n't there for pleasure , it 's there for procreation and happens to be pleasureable . Someone who indulges in this pleasure should be ready to deal with the outcome , which oftentimes is a baby .	neutral	notsarc

Does this mean its non-material ? People can actually develop physical signs from psychosomatic things ; when religious people talk in awe about the scars/bleeding etc of stigmatics , sceptics claim the physical manifestations of the power of the mind are manifest . I stated pain is deemed to be real , by scientists , including both physical , and psychosomatic , therefore it fits the first part of his challenge 'something physical ' . Can it be explained as by non-materialistic methods , yes ; psychology does so .	I know people always seem to misunderstand you , but you seem to be arguing here that pain can arise from both material and from non-material causes . O.K . A physical ( or material ) cause of pain would probably be associated with some kind of pathology , injury , auto-immune system disorder etc . - so there should be an organic explanation for it and there usually is . Sometimes no such explanation can be found and this may be down to limitations in the present state of medical knowledge ( which you say is beside the point ) . Now pain that has no apparent physical cause you seem say can be identified by psychologists has having a non-material origin . The kind of non-material origin that you mention `` the power of the mind '' is really a catch-all explanation that explains nothing .

Erm ... we are ? Levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are usually quoted as parts per million , currently a little over 380ppm , 150 years ago closer to 280 . In 1970 about 330ppm . Carbon dioxide in the Earth 's atmosphere - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia	The wikipedia reference has recorded data from : `` The Mauna Loa Observatory ( MLO ) is an atmospheric baseline station on Mauna Loa volcano , on the big island of Hawaii . Since 1957 MLO has been continuously monitoring and collecting data relating to atmospheric change , and is known especially for their continuous monitoring of atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) levels , which is sometimes referred to as the Keeling Curve . The observatory is under the Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory ( CMDL ) which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) .

Abortion is the greatest moral evil of our time . Dr. James Dobson .	The one thing Dobson ca n't answer logically relates to incest and rape . Why ?

It 's always interesting to me that the bible thumpers refuse to look at abortion other than through religious , save the fetus , eyes and yet , are ready to KILL the sicko 's of society when they have committed a haneous crime . Too many `` thumpers '' do n't read all of bible . And yet the same bible states : Abortion is not murder . A fetus is not considered a human life . If men strive , and hurt a woman with child , so that her fruit depart from her , and yet no mischief follow : he shall be surely punished , according as the woman 's husband will lay upon him ; and he shall pay as the judges determine . And if any mischief follow , then thou shalt give life for life . -- Exodus 21:22-23 The Bible places no value on fetuses or infants less than one month old . And if it be from a month old even unto five years old , then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver , and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver . -- Leviticus 27:6 Fetuses and infants less than one month old are not considered persons . Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers , by their families : every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them . And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD . -- Numbers 3:15-16 God sometimes approves of killing fetuses . And Moses said unto them , Have ye saved all the women alive ? ... Now therefore kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him . -- Numbers 31:15-17 ( Some of the non-virgin women must have been pregnant . They would have been killed along with their unborn fetuses . ) Your bible , not mine . Maybe Dobson needs to read a bit more of his bible rather than condeming others .

I meant a decision that the majority of the population has made in regards to legislation .	I know what you meant . My comment was to demonstrate the counter side of the issue . Interracial marriage laws were overturned at a time when this country disapproved of interracial marriage by a margin of three to one . By your approach , interracial marriage laws SHOULD NOT have been overturned in the 1960 's . In fact , by your approach we still would have had illegal interracial marriage into the late 80 's , early 90 's . The 14th amendment makes no proviso about allowing unjust discrimination in cases of majority rule . By your approach , WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT ? If the majority disapproves of the discrimination , they simply `` vote '' it out of existence . No need for the courts at all .	disagree	notsarc
A mother who killed herself and her disabled daughter had been terrorised by a gang of youths and had her repeated pleas for help ignored by police , an inquest was told yesterday . The single mother , her daughter and teenage son , Anthony , had endured ten years of being virtual prisoners in their own home as a gang of up to 16 street kids tormented them for simply existing Despite Mrs Pilkington and her family repeatedly calling the police and reporting that they had received death threats , she was told to close her curtains and ignore the children , a jury was told . A Leicestershire Police log shows that she called them more than twenty times in seven years to say that her severely dyslexic sons life had been threatened , her daughter , who had acute special needs , was being bullied and her house was under attack from the gang of youths .

That 's a stretch you do n't need to make though . Not even considering the fact that the bible contradicts itself..i.e . god performs miracles , speaks to people , etc ... .. it 's the definition that god is supernatural that in itself , can not be reconciled with god `` appearing '' . The same goes for any diety , or imaginary thing , if by definition they are imaginary/supernatural . Once you `` find '' something supernatural , they are no longer imaginary or supernatural , thus , you can never find them , they can only exist , by definition , without evidence , with faith . It 's relativity in action yet again The contradiction you illustrate stands apart from the bible . -Mach	that is not true . a levitating guru that has been seen and proven to levitate doesnt make the process natural . an alien that has been seen and proven to teleport and abduct people in their retractor beam doesnt make the process less paranormal . the definition of supernatural/paranormal doesnt automatically mean they can never be observed , just that they defy physical law . the definition of God is a special case that includes never being observed/proven	disagree	notsarc

As to HOW thought or awareness generates a new phenotypic trait , well first you need to show that thought or awareness DOES generate a new phenotypic trait . THEN you can begin to elucidate a mechanism . Till you show the effect you need to explain by a mechanism you have nothing to explain . .	so in order for me to win this debate I have to explain how thoughts turn into physical realities ? C'mmon . That 's what 's so damaging about these types of experiements ... such as the one with the spine-developing flea . You stick a predator near a bug or other creature , and amazingly new morphology develops -- either during development or even later in life . Snails , for example can grow larger when predators are around . Lots of things are like that . Fish , for example , in small fish tanks have a tendency to stay small , while the same type fish in very big tanks get much bigger . Thus , something inside the organism is putting the brakes on growth . But what is it ? Just because I can not point to this particular entity does not mean it does n't exist -- the evidence is right there in front of you that external stimuli is physically acted upon by the organism -- probably by way of a nervous system response . This is why science has forever ignored doing experiments on animals by changing their locations and checking for responsive , heritable phenotypic adjustments . They simply do not want to have to confront the notion that life changes non-materialistically -- that thought or awareness can start the process of physical change ... .that there are causes to biological change . This concept of mind over matter is simply unexplainable by science because science is not interested in the mind -- or anything else that can not be measured or defined . If I raise my arm and then claim that there was a thought-command before hand , how would I ever prove to you that there was indeed a thought-command that caused the arm to raise ?	disagree	notsarc

Court : Seattle police OK to stun pregnant woman By GENE JOHNSON & # 8232 ; ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER SEATTLE -- Three Seattle police officers were justified when they used a stun gun on a pregnant mother who refused to sign a traffic ticket , a federal appeals court ruled Friday in a case that prompted an incredulous dissent . Malaika Brooks was driving her son to Seattle 's African American Academy in 2004 when she was stopped for doing 32 mph in a school zone . She insisted it was the car in front of her that was speeding , and refused to sign the ticket because she thought she 'd be admitting guilt . Rather than give her the ticket and let her go on her way , the officers decided to arrest her . One reached in , turned off her car and dropped the keys on the floor . Brooks stiffened her arms against the steering wheel and told the officers she was pregnant , but refused to get out , even after they threatened to stun her . The officers - Sgt . Steven Daman , Officer Juan Ornelas and Officer Donald Jones - then stunned her three times , in the thigh , shoulder and neck , and hauled her out of the car , laying her face-down in the street . Brooks gave birth to a healthy baby two months later , but has permanent scars from the Taser . She sued the officers for violating her constitutional rights , and U.S. District Judge Richard Jones allowed the case to continue . He declined to grant the officers immunity for performing their official duties and said Brooks ' rights were clearly violated . But in a 2-1 ruling Friday , a panel of the 9th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed . Judges Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain held that the officers were justified in making an arrest because Brooks was obstructing them and resisting arrest . The use of force was also justified because of the threat Brooks posed , Hall wrote : `` It seems clear that Brooks was not going to be able to harm anyone with her car at a moment 's notice . Nonetheless , some threat she might retrieve the keys and drive off erratically remained , particularly given her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation . '' They also noted that the force used was n't that serious because the Taser was in `` touch '' mode rather than `` dart '' mode , which hurts more . They reversed the lower court 's opinion and held that the officers were entitled to immunity from the lawsuit . The officers ' lawyers , Ted Buck and Karen Cobb , said the officers made the right decision under the circumstances they faced . `` Police officers have to have the ability to compel people to obey their lawful orders , '' Buck said . That 's all the court recognized today . The 9th Circuit just applied the law instead of getting caught up in the otherwise unfortunate factual circumstances . '' The majority 's opinion outraged Judge Marsha Berzon , who called it `` off the wall . '' `` I fail utterly to comprehend how my colleagues are able to conclude that it was objectively reasonable to use any force against Brooks , let alone three activations of a Taser , in response to such a trivial offense , '' she wrote . She argued that under Washington law , the officers had no authority to take Brooks into custody : Failure to sign a traffic infraction is not an arrestable offense , and it 's not illegal to resist an unlawful arrest . Berzon said the majority 's notion that Brooks obstructed officers was so far-fetched that even the officers themselves did n't make that legal argument . To obstruct an officer , one must obstruct the officer 's official duties , and the officers ' only duties in this case were to detain Brooks long enough to identify her , check for warrants , write up the citation and give it to her . Brooks ' failure to sign did not interfere with those duties , she said . Furthermore , Brooks posed no apparent threat , and the officers could not have known how stunning her would affect the fetus , or whether it might prompt premature labor - another reason their actions were inexcusable , Berzon said . Brooks ' lawyer , Eric Zubel , said he would ask the 9th Circuit to rehear the case . `` This is outrageous - that something like this could happen to a pregnant woman , in front of an elementary school , at 8:30 in the morning , to someone who posed no threat whatsoever , '' he said .	One wonders if there was n't an element of racism involved .	disagree	notsarc
If one agrees to a discussion without using the Bible as some people insist , then they have set the terms of the debate . In essence these terms are : 1 . Facts are neutral . However , there are no such things as brute facts ; all facts are interpreted . Once the Bible is eliminated in the argument , then the Christians presuppositions are gone , leaving them unable to effectively give an alternate interpretation of the facts . Their opponents then have the upper hand as they still have their presuppositions  see Naturalism , logic and reality .	This is where intuitive , ready agreement with the opening paragraph starts to get the reader into trouble . All facts are interpreted according to presuppositions , so it 's only fair that Creationists should get to bring their presuppositions to the table just like everyone else , right ? Well , let 's apply that same blanket reasoning to other situations and see what happens . Imagine a juror whose personal prejudices lead him to presuppose the guilt of a defendant based on her skin colour , and to interpret the facts of the case accordingly . Should he be allowed to sit in judgement ? Of course not - but according to the reasoning presented by AiG that leaves us in an impossible position : by eliminating those jurors predisposed to return a guilty verdict based upon race , we necessarily cede the court to those predisposed to return an innocent verdict based upon race . Our intuition rightly rebels at this false dichotomy . We readily apprehend the existence of a middle ground wherein skin colour confers neither automatic guilt nor automatic innocence . Ah , but ! Is that neutrality itself not merely another presupposition , another axiom through which the facts are being interpreted ? One might protest that it is not , that the irrelevance of skin colour as a determinant of guilt can be determined empirically . But it would be in vain , because there are , after all , no such thing as 'brute facts ' . The data you supply to justify your position only do so when interpreted according to your presupposition that guilt can be race-agnostic . To someone whose presupposition is otherwise , your 'facts ' mean something quite different - they might for instance mean the research itself must be corrupt and biased , or at least faulty in some unknown way . In short , following Ken Ham 's reasoning we find ourselves deep in a rabbit hole with no end in sight . We can venture to justify no opinion or belief , because the facts that appear to support one may upon the least whim be reinterpreted in the light of another . I may if I so choose presuppose the bible to be the work of the devil himself , and I am not to be chastised nor deterred through argument , for the axioms by which I choose to interpret the world are , in Ken 's eyes , inviolate . This is hardly the result Ken could have intended . What 's gone wrong ? Why has his fair-minded attempt to level the playing field backfired so badly ? The answer , of course , is that the playing field is n't really level . Every once in a while someone will decide that he can fly , and attempt to demonstrate this facility to the world by leaping from a high place . The world thus far has remained largely unimpressed . This is an extreme example of what can happen when the axioms one uses to interpret the world conflict with those upon which it really operates , and it provides the first key to unlocking our dilemma : Good axioms yield accurate predictions . As Ken rightly observed , known facts are always subject to interpretation . But the reverse process , the prediction of facts yet to come based on a formulated theory , is not . In making a prediction we are forced to stop shoehorning data into our preconceived worldview and make a statement about what we will find . This yields the closest thing we have to a truly objective measurement of congruence between theory and reality . This understanding allows us to validate or repudiate the presuppositions we bring to bear on the facts at our disposal . The racist juror would from the outset predict the evidence to be presented would turn out to be stacked against the defendant , but his low 'hit rate ' would invalidate his axiom . So , part of what distinguishes Creationism from mainstream scientific understanding is that , in hindsight and on an ongoing basis its predictions fall wide of the mark . The discovery of shared pseudogenes should have been all but impossible , as should identically located retroviral insertions . We should not have found fossils at all , let alone a nested hierarchy of forms . We should not have been able to observe evolution and speciation . We should not have been able to see very distant stars and galaxies . All of these unexpected face-plants for Creationism have of course been rationalised away after the fact . Shared pseudogenes must all have some function we do n't know about ; there must be some determinism in the location of ERVs ; fossils and the geological column were all laid down in the Great Flood ; the speed of light and the rate of decay of radioactive materials were different in the past . But these rationalisations entail further predictions : we ought not to be able to safely remove pseudogenes if they are functional - but we can . If ERV insertion is deterministic we should see that in the lab - but we do n't . If fossils were laid down by the flood we would n't expect similar animals to be sorted by depth according to the number of cusps on a back tooth , or to be buried in amongst consistent strata of pollen grains , and we would n't expect there to be anything like as much limestone . If decay rates had been high enough in the past to explain what we see today in just 10,000 years , we ought to now be breathing incandescent rock vapour instead of air . And so on . Science also changes to accommodate the unexpected - but as often as not the 'unexpected ' has been discovered by scientists extrapolating existing theories to their logical conclusions , predicting something we did n't initially suspect but which has later been confirmed . And that 's the bottom line : Creationism and science both evolve as new facts emerge , but while the result for science has been a trend towards better and more accurate predictions , indicative of closing the gap between theory and reality , Creationism remains a tumbling snowball of post-hoc rationalisation growing around a hard core of sacred axioms that - it would certainly appear thus far - make it impossible for the convergence of prediction and reality to occur .	neutral	notsarc
Susan Smith shocked the nation with the murder of her children . She believed her two young boys were an obstacle to remarriage , so she placed them in her car , fastened their seat belts , and drove them into the lake . Smith 's crime was especially obscene because she violated the most fundamental moral obligation of all : the responsibility a mother has for her own children . Yet would n't Susan Smith be exonerated by Thompson 's and McDonagh 's logic ? These children were kidnappers and interlopers , trespassing on Smith 's life , depriving her of liberty . Why not kill them ? Those boys were attacking her . It was self-defense . Last year , a couple in New York was arrested when authorities learned they took a 10-day vacation to Florida and left their young children behind to fend for themselves . If McDonagh 's and Thompson 's arguments work , these parents should be released from jail because they bear no more obligation towards their own children than they do to strangers across town or burglars who break into their house . Those children were invading their privacy , trespassing in their home , stealing their food .	All born children , and every woman had the right to be rid of them .

Since you disagree with the way the poll was run ( dividing a pregnancy into trimesters ) , how would YOU have run that poll ? Specifically , how would you phrase a poll to determine people 's views about the stage of pregnancy or fetal development they think is morally critical enough to outlaw abortion ?	Well , we should both agree that first off the generally public does n't exactly know what it thinks a lot of the time . To be honest , this poll question worked perfectly . It shows people just do n't really know the subject very well . You are right in being confused about second trimester abortions ... I mean if you are worried about it being a valued creature then what changed ? You could probably ask why and give some possible answers and then after that follow up with exemptions and then follow up with certain examples to see where they would come out on . I think what you would find would be a public that does n't think anything through and works on a gut feeling of what they would want . For example , if you asked `` would you allow abortions in the 2nd trimester even if the woman was struggling in college '' then you 'd probably get 60 % of people to say they would allow it . If you asked it `` would you allow abortions in the 2nd trimester as a form of birth control '' then you 'd probably get 60 % saying no or more . The question is ... why is the value placed on the unborn different based on the situation of another ? Seems crazy to me . The only two positions on abortion that make any sense and are even remotely consistent are your opinion and mine . These exceptions for rape , health , etc etc are just weird and inconsistent with itself .	neutral	notsarc

Report : Kennedy barred from communion by bishop Nov. 22 , 2009 PROVIDENCE , R.I.  Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas Tobin has banned Rep.

Pro-life would be : You do n't drive drunk ( morally against it perhaps ) and you are going to make sure no one else is able to either .	This is a much poorer analogy than mine could possibly be . If drunk driving were legal and did n't affect anyone outside the driver 's body it could be analogous . If drunk driving did not affect anyone outside the driver 's body , I would agree that they probably should have the freedom to do so if they so choose ( even if I personally disagreed ) . However , the reason drunk driving is illegal is that it endangers everyone on the road around the driver .	disagree	notsarc
Your claim is also sunk by the fact that in states with shall-issued concealed carry , people do n't just start killing each other when there 's a traffic accident . They 're not getting out of their cars , yelling incoherently and then pulling a piece to fill the other full of holes for having the nerve to bend their fender . There are no wild west shootings in store parking lots over somebody snagging a prime parking spot that somebody else was trying to get but was just too slow .	What 's that ? `` Wild west ! Wild west ! `` ? But I digress ... You appear to be exaggerating my position , exactly as I suggested a pro-gunner would likely do ; in my very first post in this thread .

Based on what ? You admit there were 800,000 abortions performed in 1973 but yet if you dared to check the fertility rate between 1972 to 1973 it is nearly static ; meaning there were just as many people giving birth before and after Roe . Surely , 800,000 potential births being aborted would have cut the fertility rate sharpely but it did n't . You do n't have to be a rocket-scientist to speculate what this means ; that just as many women were having abortions between 1972 - 1973 and Roe v Wade only changed who was performing these abortions ... not whether people were having them or not .	so a 200,000 or 20 % decrease in abortions happened because abortion became legal ? Where is your rocket-science skills on that one ? Aside from the actual numbers not being known , the experts still state that it probably was n't as high as many abortions activists claim . http : //www.forerunner.com/forerunner ... thout_Roe.html	disagree	sarc
Do you disagree that The inheritance of acquired characteristics is simply changes in physiology acquired over the life of an organism that are transmitted to offspring ?	That definition is n't what I 'm disagreeing with I 'm just pointing out why it 's not happening here . Retroviruses , as I said , open up some very interesting possibilities . I 'm not aware of any conclusive research taking place - I know the immune system makes use of them but I do n't think there 's any evidence of immunity being passed down in that way : early mothers ' milk is the mechanism for that ( packed with a payload of antibodies to prime the infant 's immune system ) . To be honest , I think the existence of that system rather stomps on the plausibility of Lamarckian inheritance ; why bother going to all that trouble if the parent could simply code immunity into the genes it passes to its offspring ?	neutral	notsarc
Each side tries to support their own worldview . There are two positions , and sides are chosen . It 's human nature . Yes . I can only speak for myself - winning converts is what the Bible suggests , but I do n't believe in doing it in a forceable way . I do n't believe one person / one event wins a convert all at once , it takes a combination of many tiny little steps ( examples ) to win converts . My main reason for posting here is political . I do n't believe it 's possible to have neutrality in government . If church & amp ; state are separated , atheism and state are combined . Atheism almost always equals secular `` progression '' , and Judeo Christianity almost always equals tradition , according to unchanging Biblical morals . The two quickly clash in politics . Also , I do n't believe future generations ( school children ) are having the gaps in godless evolution explained to them clearly enough . I enjoy written debates very much , and I 'm trying to show how evolution can establish atheism in the U.S. government , in violation of the text of the First Amendment and intent of the framers . I believe there has to be a God because I see no compelling evidence that life spontaneously generated from non living chemicals . I was brought up without anyone forcing me what to believe , and went to church occasionally . My church attendance did n't get very regular until my late twenties - about twenty years ago . A few Bible studies , comparing it to the flow of events , the nature of people , my shortcomings , the shortcomings of science etc , convinced me . Though it does n't really say why , the Bible says that is what will happen . See Matthew 7 :13,14 . It 's part of God 's plan . Free will .	Very well said , but remember , Evolution doesnt mean atheism , but creationism means religion . I know Christians that believe in evolution , but i dont know atheists that believe in creationism .	neutral	notsarc

Some animals do not fall neatly into the categories of being warm or cold-blooded . Bats , for example , are mammals who can not maintain a constant body temperature and cool off when they are not active . Echidnas maintain a range of body temperatures which usually lies between 77 and 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit and have difficulty cooling down . Mole Rats are another group of mammals who are unable to regulate their body temperature , however , since they live underground , the temperature of their environment does not change much . Some warm-blooded animals , such as bears , groundhogs , gophers and bats hibernate during the cold winter . During hibernation these animals live off of stored body fat and can drop their body temperatures by as much as 50 degrees Fahrenheit . The Hawk Moth is an insect which can raise its body temperature well above the temperature of its surroundings when it is flying because of its huge wing muscles which generate heat when in use . Bees are another example of insects that can raise their body temperatures above that of their environment by moving their wings rapidly to generate heat .

It demonstrates that you have n't bothered to learn the most basic ideas of the topic and that you are willing to let some creationist hack dupe you .

They reasoned that the deeper the fossils were , the older they were . Thus , they assigned relative ages to certain types of strata . Of course , their estimates of actual age were way off , since they thought that the earth was only a few million years old .

In the theory of evolution , what did it all start with ?	In the theory of evolution , it all started with life . I know that you have been told that the big bang theory is part of evolution . It 's not . The word evolution means change . In some situations it still has a meaning that it had back in Victorian times . It meant change in a particular direction , as in stelar evolution - stars `` evolve '' in predictable ways . It also sometimes carries the connotation of progress . But none of these meanings are applicable to theories of biological evolution . There is no concept of purpose or direction to the word when used in a biological context . Here is a more precise definition of evolution : evolution is a change in the heritable characteristics of a population of living organisms over generations . When scientist or a knowledgable amateur speaks of the `` theory of evolution , '' it is this theory that is being discussed . Unmodified , the term has come to mean biological evolution . Those who include the big bang ( cosmological evolution ) or the formation , life and death of stars ( stelar evolution ) are either ignorant or dishonest . Even the question of the origin of life is irrelevant . One may postulate a magical , all powerful being that created the first life .

Often abortion supporters convey their message as one of championing the cause of freedom of choice and resistance of the oppression of others values on women . Perhaps this should be posted as a poll but I wonder if this support for `` choice '' remains consistent . Do those who support the choice of abortion also support the choice to bear children ? Do they abhor the imposition of the one child rule on the women of China for example ? The woman 's choice is restricted and the ideals of the government are imposed upon her . Do those here who support the freedom of choice of abortion denounce China 's policies and support the freedom of choice of bearing children ? There are also some areas in India where a person running for an elected office can not have more than two children ( there are obvious implications of this policy on what the makeup of the ruling government will be and how it will institute policy ) . Do those supporting the choice of abortion denounce this policy as a restriction of choice ? Or do environmental and population concerns outweigh and assume more importance than the freedom of choice in the above examples ?	Well , I ca n't speak for anyone else , but I support any choice that the woman wants to make . No , I do n't support forced abortions anywhere , I do n't support what 's going on in China and India because they 're still taking a choice away from the women . What I do n't get is that many prolifers think that prochoicers are ONLY for the choice of abortion . All the prochoicers I know support any choice the woman feels right about making . For example , I was called a hypocrite because I 'm prochoice and pregnant . The person said `` You 're forcing others to abort while you carry to term . '' I have NEVER forced anyone to do anything , nor will I ever . I 've also never aborted ... and many prolifers automatically assume that if one is prochoice they 've aborted .	neutral	notsarc
Why are trying to prove that God exists or does not exist based on the design of our eye ? First of all if you want proof that our bodies are poorly designed you can look at more things than just our eye . The same goes for the complexities of our bodies design although I would think that the downsides are much worse and more common .	Except for possible exception of a couple evangelistic atheists , the design argument is from the creationist side . It is pretty old being first stated by William Paley . Darwin respected Paley and thought his arguments beautiful until he actually started looking at reality ( Darwin also lived in that same rooms at Christ 's College , Cambridge that Paley did ) . The argument from design is presented as `` proof '' of God or an `` intelligent '' designer for those who want to pretend that intelligent design creationism ins't creationism . But the argument on the other side is that it is flawed design and therefore is n't `` proof '' . Evolutionary biologists do n't assert that there is not god , only that there is no evidence from nature that there is one . Science is naturalistic . Even if some scientists ( and others ) are philosophical naturalists , science does n't work that way . It is methodological naturalism simply because there are no tools by which science can examine or quantify the supernatural . It sounds silly when some claim that scientists are wrong when they fail to consider the supernatural in naturalism .	neutral	notsarc

Most scientists agree that there needs to be a sufficiently developed cerebral cortex in order for pain to be registered as such . The cerebral cortex is not sufficiently developed enough in the fetus to feel pain until roughly the start of the third trimester . Otherwise , the movements of an early fetus or embryo away from a stimulus are simply reflex action . Those of you who might have disected a frog in biology class in High School might have experienced it yourself when seeing the leg of a newly dead frog move under stimulus . For the novice , it may appear to be a reaction to a felt pain but it is not . Here is one link to a comprehensive study on fetal pain made by the American Medical Association : http : //jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/294/8/947	GULLIBLE TREATMENT OF TRUMPED UP `` STUDY '' ON FETAL PAIN ISSUE SHOULD EMBARRASS J.A.M.A . AND SOME JOURNALISTS This memo offers a number of points of information regarding the article `` Fetal Pain : A Systematic Multidisciplinary Review of the Evidence , '' published in the August 24 edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) . Any of the material below , if not otherwise attributed , can be attributed to NRLC Legislative Director Douglas Johnson ( Legfederal @ aol.com ) , who prepared this memorandum . See this here : http : //www.nrlc.org/abortion/Fetal_P ... uttalJAMA.html The following excerpt is from : http : //abort73.com/HTML/I-A-2a-pain.html `` Sir Albert Lilley , widely considered the `` Father of Fetology '' , and unabashedly pro-life ( as anyone with his vast knowledge of fetal development should be ) makes some remarkable statements about fetal pain in an interview he conducted for the book The Tiniest Humans . Question : In the case of an 8- to-10-week fetus , if you apply pressure will it tend to try to get out of the way ? Answer : Normally it would be extremely difficult , apart from putting a foreign instrument or needle into the uterus to apply pressure , but with a fetus at that maturity you have a very small fetus in a larger capsule of fluid . However , as the famous work of Dr. Davenport Hooker shows , in his many thousands of feet of film , babies at this maturity are responsive to touch . The fetus also responds violently to painful stimuli-needle puncture and injection of cold or of hypertonic solutions- stimuli which you and I find painful , children will tell you are painful , and the neonate , to judge from his responses , finds painful . -- - I have been told by advocates of abortion that we have no proof that the fetus actually feels pain . Strictly , they are quite correct . Pain is a peculiarly personal and subjective experience and there is no biochemical or physiological test we can do to tell that anyone is in pain - a phenomenon which makes it very easy to bear other people 's pain stoically , which is an important point for obstetricians to remember . By the same token we lack any proof that animals feel pain . However , to judge from their responses , it seems charitable to assume they do . Were this not so there would be no point in having an organization like the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , and I for one would be unhappy to think we would withhold from the human fetus a charitable consideration we were prepared to extend to animals . Question : The question , then , of pain felt by the fetus - it is your personal opinion , I gather from what you say in your paper , that in effect the fetus does feel pain ? Answer : I can only say that the fetus responds violently to stimuli that you and I would find painful . Bertrand Russell once remarked that a fisherman had told him that fish had neither sense or sensation , but how he knew that the fisherman would not tell him . '' The following excerpt is from : http : //www.theinterim.com/2000/nov/21fetalpain.html `` Dr. Glover 's research in the area of fetal pain is hardly groundbreaking . Sir Albert W. Liley , the pre-eminent fetologist from New Zealand , had no doubt , on the basis of objective evidence , that the fetus has a capacity to feel pain . In 1963 , Dr. Liley , the founder of fetology , developed the first surgical technique for administering intrauterine blood transfusions to the fetus . According to Liley , the fetus feels pain as early as three months . In offering instructions for carrying out the surgical technique of fetal blood transfusions , he advised his colleagues to take into serious consideration this fact of fetal pain . During the actual surgical procedure , the child must be sedated and given pain-relieving medication . Dr. Margaret Liley , wife and assistant to her husband , and a distinguished fetologist and pediatrician in her own right , remarks in her well-known book , Modern Motherhood : When doctors first began invading the sanctuary of the womb , they did not know that the unborn baby would react to pain in the same fashion as a child would . But they soon learned that he would . By no means a vegetable ' as he has so often been pictured , the unborn knows perfectly well when he has been hurt , and he will protest it just as violently as would a baby in a crib . In referring to aborting a 12-week-old fetus by dilatation and curettage , ( in which the neck of the womb is dilated and the fetus removed in pieces after the womb has been scraped by a sharp instrument called a curette ) , Dr. Eugene Diamond stated in 1971 : `` When this procedure is done , there is little doubt that the fetus , in fact , feels what is done to it . '' In a comprehensive treatment of fetal pain , published in 1985 in the New England Journal of Medicine , Dr. K. Annand , a Harvard physiologist , stated that the fetus first perceives pain as early as 12 weeks . In a May 1975 piece in Atlantic , Willard Gaylin and Marc Lappe argue for fetal experimentation , which they contend is far less traumatic for the unborn than certain forms of abortion . If society allows a child in the womb to be subjected to `` unimaginable acts of violence , '' they write , such as `` dismemberment , salt-induced osmotic shock , or surgical extirpation , '' how can it balk at fetal experimentation , most forms of which are incomparably more benign . Fetal pain , of course , is a matter of fact , not ideology . Science , of course , should be based on fact , not political correctness . We live in a Therapeutic Culture in which popping pills has become a national pastime . We are only too sensitive about pain , inconvenience , and possibly offending someone . Yet our own ultra-sensitivity to pain does not , in general , extend to the unborn . Are we inconsistent in our war against pain ? Is there a blatant contradiction that runs through the very heart of our Therapeutic Culture ? The answer to this apparent dilemma lies in the fact that there are different levels of pain . Pain exists on a spiritual as well as on a physical level . Of the two , as many psychologists and psychiatrists have averred , the spiritual kind is more difficult to bear . The difference between the two is akin to the difference between pain and suffering . The suffering in one 's soul that can arise from humiliation , guilt , despair , and terror , are formidable . An athlete would rather risk breaking his neck driving for a fly ball than feel the humiliation of being called a wimp . A soldier would rather risk injury and even death , than suffer the shame of dishonor . A Christian would rather mortify himself than experience the disgrace that comes with mortal sin . Defeat , dishonor , disgrace , as a rule , are far more devastating than physical pain . There is a pain that goes with being egregiously wrong ( shame ) or being recklessly immoral ( disgrace ) or being purposely obtuse ( humiliation ) that is more acute than physical pain . Our Therapeutic Culture is not inconsistent . Those who promote abortion want to spare themselves the pain that goes with suffering shame , disgrace , and humiliation . Because of that , they are willing to deny the pain that the aborted baby feels . To acknowledge what abortion really means is too painful for them . They would rather retreat into the presumed security of their comforting ideology . Pain and birth go together in a mysterious way , like death and life , fall and redemption . The birth of a child or the rebirth of an adult requires a certain amount of pain . Birth and redemption both demand pain . Abortion was instituted in an attempt to avoid pain . But it has magnified the very thing it had sought to reduce . We are drowning in a sea of tranquilizers while we increase our suffering . We thought we could eliminate physical suffering , but brought about spiritual torment . The abortion issue , like an ellipse , has two foci : one is the birth of the child ( which is accompanied by pain ) ; the other , the rebirth of the pro-abortionist ( which is accompanied by suffering ) . Part of the painful truth about the abortion issue is that it includes both the unborn and the unrepentant .

the child in the womb feels pain.. when you put the needle up there to try to give the child anestesia in the womb , the child moves away to not get stuck by the needle . Its because it feels pain.. this is after 18 weeks . this is a child in the womb..	The VAST majority of abortions are performed within the first trimester . When they are performed in the second trimester it 's a serious procedure for the mother to go through , and is something she obviously would n't go into lightly . Her reasons for choosing an abortion as late as that would have to far outweigh anything else , and she would need consent from two doctors to go ahead with it . Basically what I 'm trying to say is something like the foetus being developed enough to feel pain would not change the mind of a woman who had just found out she was pregnant and she 'd been raped , or was going through something you ca n't understand . For an abortion that late she 'd have to deliver the foetus anyway , which is traumatising enough .	disagree	notsarc

How about the actual scientists who reject the media promotion of this issue ? Here 's an excerpt : Climatologists Reject Media Claims of Global Warming Consensus `` [ i ] n November 2004 , German climatologist Hans von Storch , director of the GKSS Institute for Coastal Research ( IfK ) in Geesthacht , Germany , foresaw that claims of alarmist consensus would be made by nonscientists ... '' Environment & amp ; Climate News > August 2005 Environment Environment > Climate : Consensus Email a Friend Written By : Alan Caruba Published In : Environment & amp ; Climate News > August 2005 Publication date : 08/01/2005 Publisher : The Heartland Institute Leading climatologists spent the month of June fighting false proclamations from non-scientists claiming scientists have reached agreement that catastrophic global warming is occurring . Alarmists Claim Debate Over On June 1 , California Gov . Arnold Schwarzenegger ( R ) claimed `` the debate is over '' and global warming alarmists ' predictions had carried the day . The Natural Resources Defense Council on June 9 declared , `` The world 's leading scientists now agree that global warming is real and is happening right now . According to their forecasts , extreme changes in climate could produce a future in which erratic and chaotic weather , melting ice caps and rising sea levels usher in an era of drought , crop failure , famine , flood and mass extinctions . '' On June 13 , USA Today declared , `` The debate 's over : Globe is Warming . '' In support of its claim , the newspaper cited the positions of some left-leaning religious groups , some corporations who will reap a financial windfall from a switch to alternative fuel sources , and some politicians . Scientists Disagree While each of the above claims from non-scientists received significant media coverage , leading climatologists spent the month of June rebutting such proclamations . Atmospheric physicist S. Fred Singer , professor emeritus of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and former director of the U.S . Weather Satellite Service , sent a letter to the editor of USA Today directly refuting its claim . `` Your editorial ... claim [ s ] the global warming debate is over . Not so , '' wrote Singer . Singer wrote , `` Sea level will continue to rise by only seven inches per century as it has for thousands of years no matter what we do or what the EPA [ U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ] says . And temperatures in the next 100 years will likely rise by less than one degree F -- not exactly a catastrophe . '' Added Singer in a subsequent letter to the Canadian media , `` Thousands of scientists from many countries now fully understand that Kyoto and other efforts to control human emissions of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) are ineffective and entirely unfounded scientifically . `` Even if you ignore the enormous cost of Kyoto ( estimated recently by Prof. George Taylor of Oregon State University -- see http : //www.sitewave.net/news/s49p628.htm -- at one trillion U.S. dollars a year for full implementation in OECD countries ) , climate science research is rapidly moving AWAY from the hypothesis that the human release of greenhouse gases , specifically CO2 , is in any way significantly contributing to global climate change . '' Sun Called Primary Cause `` If we just look at the historical data , there is a scientific consensus that the global mean temperature has risen modestly during the twentieth century , '' said Myron Ebell , director of global warming and environmental policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute . `` The impacts have been small and probably beneficial in aggregate . This historical data puts the onus of demonstration on those who think this gradual warming trend will accelerate and lead to dire consequences . '' The controlling driver of global temperature fluctuations , according to Dr. Benny Peiser of England 's John Moore 's University , is solar ray activity . `` Six eminent researchers from the Russian Academy of Science and the Israel Space Agency have just published a startling paper in one of the world 's leading space science journals . The team of solar physicists claims to have come up with compelling evidence that changes in cosmic ray intensity and variations in solar activity have been driving much of the Earth 's climate , '' Peiser was quoted as saying in the May 17 National Post . Moreover , reports Peiser , Jan Veizer , one of Canada 's top earth scientists , published a comprehensive review of recent findings and concluded , `` empirical observations on all time scales point to celestial phenomena as the principal driver of climate , with greenhouse gases acting only as potential amplifiers . '' Added Peiser , `` In fact , the explicit and implicit rejection of the 'consensus ' is not restricted to individual scientists . It also includes distinguished scientific organizations such as the Russian Academy of Science and the U.S. Association of State Climatologists , both of which are highly skeptical of the whole idea . `` Heartland Institute - Article And here 's more : Renowned Scientist Defects From Belief in Global Warming  Caps Year of Vindication for Skeptics October 17 , 2006 October 17 , 2006 Washington DC - One of the most decorated French geophysicists has converted from a believer in manmade catastrophic global warming to a climate skeptic . This latest defector from the global warming camp caps a year in which numerous scientific studies have bolstered the claims of climate skeptics . Scientific studies that debunk the dire predictions of human-caused global warming have continued to accumulate and many believe the new science is shattering the media-promoted scientific consensus on climate alarmism . Claude Allegre , a former government official and an active member of France's Socialist Party , wrote an editorial on September 21 , 2006 in the French newspaper L'Express titled The Snows of Kilimanjaro ( For English Translation , click here : U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works ) detailing his newfound skepticism about manmade global warming . See : http : //www.lexpress.fr/idees/tribune ... asp ? ida=451670 Allegre wrote that the cause of climate change remains unknown and pointed out that Kilimanjaro is not losing snow due to global warming , but to local land use and precipitation changes . Allegre also pointed out that studies show that Antarctic snowfall rate has been stable over the past 30 years and the continent is actually gaining ice . Following the month of August experienced by the northern half of France , the prophets of doom of global warming will have a lot on their plate in order to make our fellow countrymen swallow their certitudes ,  Allegre wrote . He also accused proponents of manmade catastrophic global warming of being motivated by money , noting that the ecology of helpless protesting has become a very lucrative business for some people !  Allegre , a member of both the French and U.S. Academy of Sciences , had previously expressed concern about manmade global warming . `` By burning fossil fuels , man enhanced the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which has raised the global mean temperature by half a degree in the last century , '' Allegre wrote 20 years ago . In addition , Allegre was one of 1500 scientists who signed a November 18 , 1992 letter titled World Scientists ' Warning to Humanity in which the scientists warned that global warming's potential risks are very great. See : Warning to Humanity Allegre has authored more than 100 scientific articles , written 11 books and received numerous scientific awards including the Goldschmidt Medal from the Geochemical Society of the United States . Allegre 's conversion to a climate skeptic comes at a time when global warming alarmists have insisted that there is a consensus about manmade global warming . Proponents of global warming have ratcheted up the level of rhetoric on climate skeptics recently . An environmental magazine in September called for Nuremberg-style trials for global warming skeptics and CBS News 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley compared skeptics to Holocaust deniers. See : U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works & amp ; Scott Pelley And Catherine Herrick On Global Warming Coverage - Public Eye In addition , former Vice President Al Gore has repeatedly referred to skeptics as `` global warming deniers . '' This increase in rhetorical flourish comes at a time when new climate science research continues to unravel the global warming alarmists' computer model predictions of future climatic doom and vindicate skeptics . 60 Scientists Debunk Global Warming Fears Earlier this year , a group of prominent scientists came forward to question the so-called consensus that the Earth faces a climate emergency. On April 6 , 2006 , 60 scientists wrote a letter to the Canadian Prime Minister asserting that the science is deteriorating from underneath global warming alarmists . Observational evidence does not support today 's computer climate models , so there is little reason to trust model predictions of the future Significant [ scientific ] advances have been made since the [ Kyoto ] protocol was created , many of which are taking us away from a concern about increasing greenhouse gases . If , back in the mid-1990s , we knew what we know today about climate , Kyoto would almost certainly not exist , because we would have concluded it was not necessary ,  the 60 scientists wrote . See : Open Kyoto to debate It was only 30 years ago that many of today 's global-warming alarmists were telling us that the world was in the midst of a global-cooling catastrophe . But the science continued to evolve , and still does , even though so many choose to ignore it when it does not fit with predetermined political agendas ,  the 60 scientists concluded.. : U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works : : Press Room : . So in conclusion , as the alleged science of evolution is based solely on pre-determined assumptions , so is the myth of Global Warming .	disagree	sarc

That 's kind of true . The Roman Catholic church is considered not credible based on it 's support of lies , not because they archaically force their priests to act like they do n't want some , then a significant percentage of the preists fondle and abuse their flock as a result of a. being sexually repressed by their mythical laws b. close proximity to young kids c. in a position of power/trust among kids d. for all the other average reasons people do things like that . Kind of reminds us all that made-up laws and made-up law enforcement lead to nothing . Reality however , where we do have and enforce laws , actually has meaning . The conclusion is , yes indeed , the catholic church is unfit to rule anything , and anyone looking to a house of superstision for answers to life 's real problems , is not firing on all cylinders . I mean really , we could sift through some chicken guts and find the answers according to some religious shaman..no difference really . -Mach	Mach , Let me first say that you may be dealing more with chicken brains than in chicken guts in light of your most recent post . But if you can find in reading chicken guts , the richness and depth of thought that you find in the Catholic Church , then you are indeed a powerful mystic and soothsayer . The Church and its priests do not seek to erase the love and sexual feelings that men naturally have toward women ( in your words they do not seek to act like they do n't `` want some '' ) . They seek to control them and sacrifice them for a higher love . They are not pretending that they do not exist . If they do n't then you are probably dealing with an unhealthy individual who may not be fit for the priesthood . Secondly , there is much basis to the Catholic Church 's teachings on celibacy . It is not without foundation . These are not made up laws with made up enforcement . Thirdly , if you believe celibacy to be related to the perversion of pedophilia then I have a few questions for you : Have you ever had thoughts of having sex with a child when you were in a celibate period in your life ? Would being in close proximity to children in a position of authority instigate in you inclinations to molest children ? If for some reason , your significant other died or lived but for health reasons could no longer have sex would you consider pedophilia as a normal sexual outlet/interaction ? If you were required to be celibate your entire life do you think that you would be attracted to children ? And if celibacy is the problem then why does pedophilia occur in Protestant congregations at a similar rate when the pastor is not required to be celibate ? Pedophilia is a perversion , a sickness , a disorder . It has little to do with celibacy .	disagree	sarc

Dear Supersport , This will be my one and only post to this message board . It is my research you are falsely using to support your arguments . Please do not reference my work in this way in the future . Your interpretation of the plastic responses of tadpoles to chemicals produced by predators is false . Much research ( not my own , look for research by Robert Denver ) has shown that chemicals in the water produced by predators when feeding on prey , or changing environments in general , activate pathways in the body which in turn lead to increased tail size and differentiation of color . It has nothing to do with the tadpoles `` desire '' to have a larger or redder tail , it is simply a physiological response . The tadpoles have not `` evolved '' during the course of their development , as you assert . An induced phenotype is not heritable , the ability to induce it is . The tadpoles with the red tails will not produce red tailed tadpoles when they are adults . Those with clear tails will not produce clear tailed tadpoles . They will both produce tadpoles that have the ability to make either phenotype . -Justin	Moral : Do not feed the troll . He ca n't see beyond his preconceptions and wo n't understand what you say .

In reality , there are no concrete 'reasons ' for believing in God . If you believe in God , you believe based on faith . There is no incontrovertible physical evidence anywhere to even suggest that God exists ... unless you first believe through faith that God exists .	This statement is wrong . People from hundreds of years before Jesus was born prophesied that a baby would be born , in Bethlehem , of a virgin . There were over 50 more prophesies that were made about his life , and the sacrafice he made to pay for the sins of man , and the bigest one of all ... He completely fufilled scripture when he rose from the dead . These men were inspired by Jesus , God , how can you argue that he is not the christ ? The odds of one man filling all the prophesies is impossible . And these scriptures have been unchanged for the past 2000-2500 approx years !

So much wrong with that sentence ( and I 'm ignoring the grammar ) Rights have very little to do with what one perceives to be their ( or society in general ) moral obligations . Rights are concepts that focus on the actions of government and in the case of the US Constitution , usually represent exceptions of powers never granted to the government . In other words , they are redundant prohibitions ( a fact which was a primary argument against adding a bill of rights to the constitution ) .

What was truncated ? ... *more than 100 LPL gene mutations have been identified , the majority of which cause loss of enzymatic function . In contrast to this , the naturally occurring LPLS447X variant is associated with increased lipolytic function and an anti-atherogenic lipid profile and can therefore be regarded as a gain-of-function mutation . This notion combined with the facts that 20 % of the general population carries this prematurely truncated LPL ... *	The original molecule had some lipolytic function , but removing some amino acids from it , in the right place , made it fit better into the substrate , and thereby greatly increased its functionality .

When was this ? IT NEVER HAPPENED . I assume you are talking about back in 1999 , when they increased evolutionary curriculum five fold ? What they did in '99 was remove the requirement that macro evolution be taught . They have never removed old earth ( that just sounds stupid ) from earth science standards ,	You 're kidding , right ? You actually live in Kansas and you actually got yourself elected to a school board and you are unfamiliar with the efforts of creationists on the Kansas Board of Education to remove the teaching of evolution from the science standards ? You are telling a lie . Maybe you have been duped by creationists and do n't know that you are . A committee of 27 scientists and science educators was hired to rewrite the science standards . There were several drafts that were all presented to the board . When the final draft was presented , it was rejected and replaced by a version that had been put together by a YEC ( a geocentrist no less ) from Missouri . The adopted standards did not increase the evolutionary curriculum . The standards very clearly touted YEC ideas , barely mentioned even macro-evolution , and removed all references to the age of the earth and the universe . I know that sounds stupid , but then I do n't live in Kansas where school board members think that limiting mention of evolution to microevolution is smart . I read the proposed standards and the ones that were adopted . At the next election several creationists lost their seats , and the new school board threw out the `` new standards '' and adopted the version that had been written by the committee . Those standards probably actually did raise the levels of what was expected to be taught in Kansas schools from one of the worst in the nation to one of the best . You were aware that the Ford Foundation had funded a study of state science standards and Kansas had received an F. The creationist standards also received an F , and the standards written by the committee of scientists and educators received an A . You know , it almost would have been fun to be a biology teacher in Kansas when micro-evolution was OK and presentation of `` holes '' in the theory were required . I could have probably gone on for a week or two about the problems presented to the Biblical flood story from a biological standpoint . Noah 's flood requires macro-evolution . Not only that , it requires macro-evolution at rates that make the heads of evolutionary biologists spin . Just think - about 6 different species of horse , unknown numbers of cattle species , 36 different species of cat , twenty some species of the wolf/dog `` kind '' and so forth . What fun to be required to teach `` alternative '' theories in that case .

Most scientists agree that there needs to be a sufficiently developed cerebral cortex in order for pain to be registered as such . The cerebral cortex is not sufficiently developed enough in the fetus to feel pain until roughly the start of the third trimester . Otherwise , the movements of an early fetus or embryo away from a stimulus are simply reflex action .

Perhaps the most enduring factoid of the gun prohibition movement is that a person with a gun in the home is 43 times as likely to shoot someone in the family as to shoot a criminal . This `` 43 times '' figure is the all-time favorite factoid of the gun-prohibition lobby . It 's not really true , but it does tell us a lot about the gun-prohibition mindset . The source of the 43-to-1 ratio is a study of firearm deaths in Seattle homes , conducted by doctors Arthur L. Kellermann and Donald T. Reay ( `` Protection or Peril ? : An Analysis of Firearm-Related Deaths in the Home , '' New England Journal of Medicine , 1986 ) . Kellerman and Reay totaled up the numbers of firearms murders , suicides , and fatal accidents , and then compared that number to the number of firearm deaths that were classified as justifiable homicides . The ratio of murder , suicide , and accidental death to the justifiable homicides was 43 to 1 . This is what the anti-gun lobbies call `` scientific '' proof that people ( except government employees and security guards ) should not have guns . Of the gun deaths in the home , the vast majority are suicides . In the 43-to-1 figure , suicides account for nearly all the 43 unjustifiable deaths . Counting a gun suicide as part of the increased risk of having a gun in the home is appropriate only if the presence of a gun facilitates a `` successful '' suicide that would not otherwise occur . But most research suggests that guns do not cause suicide . In the book Point Blank : Guns and Violence in America , Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck analyzed suicide data for every America city with a population more than 100,000 , and found no evidence that any form of gun control ( including handgun prohibition ) had an effect on the total suicide rate . Gun control did sometimes reduce gun suicide , but not overall suicide . . But just as many other people who would commit suicide with a gun would use an equally lethal method if guns are unavailable . Many of the people who kill themselves in firearm accidents may also be bent on destruction , regardless of the means . One study of gun-accident victims found that they were `` disproportionately involved in other accidents , violent crime , and heavy drinking . '' ( Philip Cook , `` The Role of Firearms in Violent Crime : An Interpretative Review of the Literature , '' in Criminal Violence ) . Or , as another researcher put it , `` The psychological profile of the accident-prone suggests the same kind of aggressiveness shown by most murderers . '' ( Roger Lane , `` On the Social Meaning of Homicide Trends in America , '' in Violence in America , Vol . I , 1989 . )	You know , Philip Cook . The famous Anti-gun researcher .	neutral	sarc

By the way ... .it 's not 99 % , as the article states , it 's 94 %	Actually , it depends on what you are comparing and how you want to characterize certain phenomena . If you are comparing only coding sequence , then it is on the order of 99 % . If you are comparing coding and noncoding sequence , it is on the order of 97-98 % . If you consider indels not as one-time events that incorporate large-scale changes of sequence , but count the individual nuclotides within each indel , then it comes out to 94-95 % . What the creationists never seem to understand is that if you are goiong to adopt the comparison method in which indels are treated as colelctions of nuclotide changes rather than one-time events , ALL % similarities between ALL taxa will be lowered somewhat . This means that when they predictably trot out some bastardized version of Haldane 's dilemma claiming that the nmew lower similarity is even harder for evolution to explain , they do not realize how devastating this method of accounting is for creationism genetics . For now the 'increased dissimilarity ' has to be accounted for in the very short time frames allowed by biblically-constrained science - about 4,500 years instead of the hundreds of thousands or millions of years during which accumulations of DNA change can be accounted for .

Modern evolutionary synthesis From Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia  Learn more about using Wikipedia for research  Jump to : navigation , search The modern evolutionary synthesis refers to a set of ideas from several biological specialities that were brought together to form a unified theory of evolution accepted by the great majority of working biologists . This synthesis was produced over a period of about a decade ( 1936-1947 ) and was closely connected with the development from 1918 to 1932 of the discipline of population genetics , which integrated the theory of natural selection with Mendelian genetics . Julian Huxley invented the term , when he summarised the ideas in his book , Evolution : The Modern Synthesis in 1942 . Though the 'Modern Synthesis ' is the basis of current evolutionary thinking , it refers to a historical event that took place in the 1930s and 1940s . Major figures in the development of the modern synthesis include R. A. Fisher , Theodosius Dobzhansky , J.B.S . Haldane , Sewall Wright , Julian Huxley , Ernst Mayr , Bernhard Rensch , George Gaylord Simpson , and G. Ledyard Stebbins . The modern synthesis solved difficulties and confusions caused by the specialisation and poor communication between biologists in the early years of the twentieth century . Discoveries of early geneticists were difficult to reconcile with gradual evolution and the mechanism of natural selection . The synthesis reconciled the two schools of thought , while providing evidence that studies of populations in the field were crucial to evolutionary theory .

Evolutionists have taught for decades that the second law of thermodynamicsthe entropy principle that things naturally decrease in complexity rather than increaseposes no barrier to evolution . Their claim is that while there is an overall downhill trend in nature , uphill innovations can occur locally in a system if abundant energy is available . Specifically the sun 's energy provides all that is necessary to transform inorganic chemicals into a living cell and eventually into people . All that is necessary is an open system and abundant energy , especially the sun 's energy . If complicated living organisms can be created in this way , certainly something not nearly so complicated as a house could be produced . Especially a solar-powered house !	That 's obviously not what is said . The sun 's energy is not claimed to be a mechanism that makes order of disorder . What it does do is override the tendancy within the 2LoTD where total usable energy in a system decreases .	disagree	notsarc
If you want to discuss the new idea that `` the simplest explanation is most likely correct '' , then I did that in my example of BMP . That idea is wrong .	Well , the simplest explanation often proves to be correct . I could give you examples , but I 'm not sure you would pay attention . Just to show I 'm not bluffing : if you typed a paper while sleepy , went to bed , and woke up only to find errors in your paper , the best conclusion would be to assume that you made the mistakes , rather than that a hacker put them there . I expect that most times , there was no hacker . The explanation with fewer assumptions is more likely to be correct . However , having all the information is important . If you later find out that a computer genius was submitting a paper to a contest that you were submitting yours to and that most of the other papers involved had many errors , the likelyhood of a hacker goes up . Yes , I know that was a weird example . I only used it because there is someone who actually believes ( according to rinkworks.com ) that a hacker messes with her writing .	neutral	notsarc

The amount went up after it was legalized and peaked in the 80s . It has sense gone down a bit and is leveling off ( some suggest because of studies that have come out about abortion and the fact that people that do n't support abortion has gone up sense the 80s and early 90s ) .	It shot up as soon as Reagan launched his failed campaign of anti-sex education , cutting social services for the poor and destroying the US economy into a recession that favored the rich against the poor . Since social-economical reasons are often the reason why people have abortions it is no surprise we saw abortion sky-rocket under Reagans political atmosphere that was hostile to lower class families . If people were becoming more against abortion in the 90s then how can you explain Clinton's popularity in winning two elections ?

Creationism does not necessarily=YEC . The YEC crowd is their own little clique of scientific illiterates .	But most creationists are YECs .

At first , the lighter form of this moth was more common than the darker form . This lighter type blended well into the lighter-colored trunks of trees and so was more protected from birds . But then , because of years of pollution from industrial areas , tree trunks became darkened . Now the moths lighter color worked against them , as birds could pick them out faster and eat them . Consequently the darker variety of peppered moth , which is said to be a mutant , survived better because it was difficult for birds to see them against the soot-darkened trees . The darker variety rapidly became the dominant type .	Actually , the black morph was always dominant . Perhaps you do n't understand the meaning of the word dominant in biology .

Yet most biologists and geologists believe that the Earth has experienced a nearly constant average temperature over the past 4.6 billion years , with perhaps warmer conditions prevailing early on.4 The problem of how the Sun could have increased in brightness while the Earth maintained a constant temperature is called the & # 8216 ; early faint Sun paradox & # 8217 ; .	And you can bet dollars to donuts that the ACTUAL RESPONSE to this issue is never realistically addressed in this article ... Nope . So I 'll quote it here : The tension between the two hypotheses stems from the incorrect assumption that atmospheric gas concentrations in the past were the same as today . First , before the advent of abundant life the atmospheric oxygen concentrations were orders of magnitude lower than today . In the presence of oxygen methane breaks down to carbon dioxide , so in the absence of oxygen the methane concentration could be much larger than currently observed . Methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide , so the relative abundance of atmospheric methane throughout Earth 's history must be considered when modeling the temperature . Further , the inorganic version of the carbon cycle can be expected to provide negative feedback towards an Earth with liquid water . Carbon dissolved in liquid water can form carbonic acids , which can then interact with calcium to produce calcium carbonate . If rainfall were to cease and the oceans froze over , then this part of the inorganic carbon cycle would shut down . Periodic explosions from volcanoes would then cause a net increase in the atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane levels with no liquid water to absorb these emitted gases . Eventually the concentrations would become large enough that the surface temperature would rise due to the greenhouse effect . When the surface temperature became large enough for the oceans to melt and rainfall to resume the other half of the inorganic carbon cycle would turn on and moderate the greenhouse gas concentrations . http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faint_young_sun_paradox	disagree	sarc

So that's it  there's nothing else to study on the subject ? The process you describe naturally takes long periods of time .

ID proponents are often accused of saying goddidit , that settles it , stop looking , and it seems that atheists do that quite often as well . Can you quote any ID proponent saying what you said , that we don't need to develop exact paths  ? Behe can describe exploration of paths , that aren't being explored to any great extent now . ( too religious , don't-cha-know ) In his words ; Since the simplest possible design scenario posits a single cell formed billions of years ago  that already contained all information to produce descendant organisms , studies could test this scenario by attempting to calculate how much DNA would be required to code the information ( keeping in mind that much of the information might be implicit ) lf DNA alone is insufficient , studies could be initiated to see if information could be stored in the cell in other ways  for example , as positional information . Other work could focus on whether larger , compound systems ( containing two or more irreducibly complex systems ) could have developed gradually or whether there are compounded irreducibilities. Blind , purposeless , happenstance nature did it , that settles it , stop looking ?

WASHINGTON -- New Jersey 's U.S. senators plan to introduce a bill that would make it illegal for anyone , except a police officer or military official , to purchase or use an assault pistol that fires bullets capable of penetrating a bulletproof vest . The Five-SeveN gun made by FN Herstal of Belgium has already been denounced by three national police organizations and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence . The handgun is small and lightweight and easily concealed in a person 's	It looks like the anti gunners are at it again , only now they have a new target . For those who do not follow such things , the FN five seven fires a new round , the 5.7x28 . There are 2 versions of the round availabe , one is an aluminum base , steel core , FMJ round designed to pierce body armor . It is not available to civilians int he US , it is law enforcement only . The other round avaliable IS a civilian round , it is a hollowpoint which has already been cleared by the ATF as a non armor piercing round . The civilian round ( the non AP one ) WILL pierce body armor , as will a .22 magnum , and most solid point .22 LR rounds . Body armor is specifically designed to take the implact from large , slow moving rounds , not small , fast rounds . I am also a little confused as to what makes this an `` assault pistol '' . I have 2 of them . I purchsed them specifically because when the civilian version came out , I fully expected that thet antigunners would pitch a fit and we would see attempts to ban the weapon , which would boost the value of them . They pretty much look like a glock . Why is the five seven an `` assault pistol '' and the glock is not ? While I am sure we are all used to GG 's pushing for bans that have no basis in reality , even I was a little surprised that they moved so quickly on this one . Now , my anti social side is pushing me to pass on a secret regarding AP rounds . If you want a REALLY good AP round , get a 7.62x25 ( tokarev ) . You can pick up a pistol for this caliber VERY cheap ( $ 200 or less for a good makarov ) . Hand load your rounds , but instead of using the 7.62 , order some .30 sabots . You can get them from a bunch of places ( just do a search for `` .30 sabot '' on google ) . They cost about $ 10 for 100 of them . Load your 7.62x25 with a fast burning powder , and you can load a heavier powder load . Use a .223 speer FMJ . Our experiments ( we experimented with this at work when we were working on a contract related to ceramic body armor ) showed that this will go through TWO kevlar vests and 16 inched of ballistics gel , which implies rather heavily that you can reasonably expect to shoot right through 2 police officers using the round , vest or no . This being the case , does n't it seem a little frivolous to be banning a weapon , and the ammo for that weapon , especially since the ATF has already given it the green light as non AP ?	neutral	sarc

I believe God gave us evidence in the form of His word  The Bible  and I believe He gave us evidence of His eternal greatness through his miraculous Creation . Its all here for everyone to see . There are no excuses . But I submit that the Liberals in this country have one supreme goal -- trashing this evidence  on both fronts . The first thing theyve done is trashed the Bible . Theyve taken it out of our schools , out of the public arena , off the airwaves , out of courthouses , out of the military , and generally out of sight anywhere besides inside churches and homes . Instead of reading/analyzing the Bible and celebrating life , liberals would just assume everyone analyze porn and worship death .	As to your first point , as far as I can tell , you looked at the world and said , `` Naw , there 's no way this happened without God . '' And not just any God , but Trinity father son holy spirit God . The miraculous creation of our existance does not point to Christianity at all . However , you did n't just look at the 'miraculous creation , ' no you had a study guide . Allow me to mention something right here , and point out I 'm a Methodist ... .ahem THE BIBLE WAS WRITTEN BY MEN . Arguing that the events in the bible happened or not is a different issue , but God did not give us a master copy of the bible and tell us to copy it . Biblical scholars have noted that the bible is an amalgam of different authors who had different outlooks on God . The bible is an excellent source of faith and guidance , it is not an infallible work and does not answer all questions . As to your second point , argueing that liberals wish to analyze porn and worship death just shows you have n't really put much thought into this contention . You are right that the government has removed references to Christianity in its subsidiaries like public school . There is a good reason for this . I ca n't for the life of me recall where this quote is from but it said : `` Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . '' This means government is n't suppose to support religious groups . What would you define mandatory school prayer as ? Anyone who has ever argued that a seperation between church and state is n't a good thing has obviously never been the religious minority . I lived in Saudi Arabia for 10 years and I can tell you state supported religion is not good .	neutral	sarc

What if my own words and feeling sound just like that dusty book ? What if I happen to agree with it ? What if I take it in context ? Actually one would be hard pressed to show where I have ever taken it out of context . If I say that I worship Him because he is powerful , beautiful and has loved me greatly , does that mean you now get to argue those points and say he is not any of those . I would say you do not get to argue my assumptions about God as they are mine . YOu may argue my conclusions based on my assumptions but you could not argue my assumptions , nor I yours . Is that a fair statement of how to answer the question ?	It's a lot more interesting for us to read if it is in your own words . If I wanted to read a bible , I'd steal one .	neutral	sarc

this is also the reason why atheism is more like a religion . through emotional experiences , rather than deduction and reasoning , people decide whether God exists or not . it also has to do with perception , since there are christians who suffer afflictions similar to yours , and it only strengthens their faith .	It is curious how lately christians have been telling me that being an aethiest ( which I am ) , is a religion . The above post is a good example of this misunderstanding . First - the lack of a religion is NOT a religion . Second , I 'll simply disagree with your statement . Observation , reasoning , and deduction is exactly what leads me to understand that there is no god , and that religion is merely an attempt to explain what we have not yet been able to reason out . As our knowledge increases , our need for a god decreases , and we can begin to see through the emotional fog of religion that keeps us in ignorance .	neutral	sarc

Creation has been around a lot longer than your post implied . It was recorded in Genisis and passed down for many generations .	Yes , the mythology has been around for a long time . Most cultures had their own . You have adopted the mythology of ancient Hebrews . You probably even somehow reconcile both stories of creation in your mind . But the technology and the techniques to use that technology did n't develop until about 400 years ago . Every since then we have used the idea that we can learn about our world by careful observation and experimentation . About 150 years ago , Darwin and Wallace recognized a mechanism for why living things change . About the same time , Mendel recognized how those changes were passed on to off spring . That the Biblical mythology of creation was false was actually demonstrated by men who believed in creation . They tried to reconcile their Bible with what was obviously true from the observations they made . But creationism has only been around since the early 20th century . It grew out of the anti-science movement of fundamentalism . It actually became popular in the 1960 's .	disagree	notsarc
The love that cancels out all else -- life and liberty , freedom ... Carry Concealed	No . Wrong . The love that ensures life , liberty , and freedom . Your head is on backwards . I 've never seen a soldier fight for your right to open your mouth by volunteering to lay down his rifle . I 've never met a veteran who ensured your right to peacably assemble by giving up his gun . I 've never heard of a marine who guaranteed your freedom of religion by whining and crying instead of bleeding and fighting . You are an unarmed pacifist . You can never accomplish anything other than sanctimonious preaching and holier than thou mouth wagging . You have never sacrificed personal activity to physically provide or protect a right for anyone . You moan and complain about law abiding folks who actually take the time and responsibility to provide for their own safety instead of passively accepting their own propensity for victimhood such as you do . The one question I have never received an answer to : How is it that you consider it more responsible to require another human being to come running from another location and risk their life in order to save yours after something serious happens , than simply taking the initiative to do it for yourself beforehand ? All it does is blatantly highlight your inadequacy and reliance upon others to perform an action you are too passive to take upon yourself . Out of all murdered victims that have ever existed , I wonder how many have been legally armed ? Yet , if it were up to you , you would ensure we were all in the category containing the majority of victims ... ..because you , yourself , do not have the intestinal fortitude to do something you feel is acceptable for another human being with a shiny metal disk : protect your own life . You can rant . You can rave . You can decry the audacity of those who refuse to meekly submit to the victim mentality you would willingly force upon anyone with the capacity of self reliance greater than your own . There 's one thing you will never do that ensures your eventual and inevitable failure : You will never do anything more than talk . You are incapable of doing anything else . To do anything else would require something entirely too alien to your passive nature : It would require effort and sacrifice to become self reliant . Like soldiers , police , and those who protect their own lives . And that is something you would willingly take away from anyone else . If you were to be successful , you would soon lose the things you state we are cancelling out , but are in fact ensuring for you : life , liberty , and freedom . There 'd be no one left to fight for it .	disagree	sarc

If you draw a gun on someone holding a gun and do n't shoot straight away then you 're likely to get shot yourself . Without a gun you 're not a threat . If you have a gun but get taken by surprise , or a burglar goes for your gun first when he breaks in you 've just given him a better weapon . Lastly and most importantly the prevalence of guns in general makes criminals far more likely to go armed , which raises the chance of you getting shot .	Actually , might I say that you assume that the criminal had a firearm , correct ? This may seem foolish of me , but I 'll go along with you . Now , you can assume that a criminal doens't have the right mindset . There 's always a first crime , but is n't it illegal for an ex-con , a drug addict/alcholic , or someone who has a few screws loose up there to own a firearm ? So we could assume in your situation that the law was n't enforced . So let 's pretend like the law actually is enforced , shall we ? What makes you think the criminal has a firearm ? If he has a firearm , how do you know that it 's because the law was n't enforced ? The solution is to put a bit of muscle into enforcing the laws we have now . You would n't be this guy , would you ? Oh , no , my house is on fire ! I better throw some gasoline onto it ! ... Oh , no , that made it worse !

So how can I say all this and still support abortion ? I guess I simply believe that having an abortion is sometimes the humane thing to do . I believe that preventing abortions would lead to more children growing up in poverty , with parents who hate them , and becoming criminals themselves . Not all abortions can be justified but I believe there are those that can be justified . Even if only a handful can be justified , then I will disagree with a law that would completely do away with all abortions . However , if you were to debate that abortions should be more tightly monitored and laws put in place to prevent unnecessary abortions , then I would tend to agree with you .	If you still believe this way , then you must believe then it is OK to kill a child that has been born if it might not be loved , or might suffer , etc . That is the logical conclusion to your argument . If an unborn child and a born child are the same to you , then you can not make a distinction as to which one should be killed and which one should n't . That is the spiralling hole into which abortion leads . There is a basic loss of respect for human life . Your defense actually scares me more than someone who deceives themself into believing the unborn child is not alive .	disagree	notsarc

My point was n't to show that the unborn is a person but to show that the real question is n't `` Who gets to determine the future of a woman 's pregnancy , the woman herself or some nameless faceless bureaucrat ?

( 2 ) Who gets to make such arbitrary , moral decisions on behalf of a pregnant woman ? Both are legitimate issues of contention . You ca n't just dismiss the one you do n't want to argue as unimportant . There are lots of excellent arguments going every which way , and many of them are objectively unresolvable , such as the one pertaining to the onset of personhood . They are truly matters of opinion .

I 'm not going to get into a religious debate , but I can appreciate someone taking a religious stance against it . Why do I think it is wrong ? I think its wrong in the sense that it is treated as equal to heterosexualty . Its not , it can not be , and that is no ones fault but natures . Nature does n't allow homosexual sex to create life , to reproduce , and though humans use sex as entertainment , it obviously was meant for a greater purpose . Biology shows us we need both male and female to create life , that male and male does n't create life , that indivdual gratification does n't create life . If you want to attach relgious or philosophical significance to sex you may at this juncture . That is why I think it is wrong . Humanity would n't be around if homosexuality were the standard , homosexuals would n't exist without heterosexuals . You may be looking for a more fundamental `` morality '' to my basis . I choose to validate my beliefs on science and years of living proof of heterosexualitie 's superiority , and when I mean hetero superiority I mean strict hetero adhearance , no socially unacceptable behavior being thrown in like `` cheating '' or `` rape '' .	No , I was n't looking for religious morality , I was looking for general morality , so your argument was the kind I wanted to debate . Anyway , what is with people thinking that an activity that creates children is neccesarily a good thing ? There are already a lot of people in the world , and too many more will end up using up all the food , and then there will no people , because we will all die an agonizing death of starvation . Heterosexuality is good , without any reproduction we would die out as well , but homosexuality is also very good and important because without enough non reproductive couples , the population would increase even more .	disagree	notsarc

I mean , are the scientists whose field may involve evolution unique in their lack of integrity and are singularly foolish in endorsing evolution by natural selection ?

Ok , here 's a thread where I discuss that `` The Right to an Abortion is not in the Constitution . '' As you will read , this claim went unrefuted . Since the right to an abortion is not in the constitution , it may be regulated by the states however the states wish , just like speed limits and jaywalking . Thus , the states may do whatever they wish regarding abortion . They may ban abortion because they claim it harms women 's health , or they may ban abortion because they claim that the fetus is a person , or they may ban abortion because Sunday is the first day of the week .	So you made the point on the interpretation of a legal document . The point is it is okay to illegalise abortion regardless of the reasons for doing so .

As I understand , some people have claimed that the civil war was justified because the people in the southern states were exercising their 2nd amendment right to rebel . It seems questionable and contradictory to me . Do I have a right to buy a gun and start shooting politicians ? If so , is it fair that I can be arrested for exercising my rights ?	I think that laws , like history , are written by the victors . Victory has historically justified many crimes comitted by those who win the power to absolve themselve of the inhumanity they exhibited in their struggle for power . The Second Amendment does not negate laws prohibiting homicides . If David Koresh had possessed the courage to survive his encounter at Waco , then he would have been perfectly free to appear before the tribunal of his victorious adversary and defend himself in court on the grounds that his actions were protected by the Second Amendment and/or a right of self defense . I sincerely doubt , however , that you could ever find 12 people who would accept his defense . My vote would certainly go against him . Where I am from , we still refer to the Civil War as the `` War of Northern Aggression . '' But my state entered that contest with the immoral goal of preserving slavery , and I will not attempt to justify her actions through the citizen 's RKBA . She fought a long and glorious struggle which I believe is forever tainted by its immoral purpose . She was vanquished , and no one who answered her call to arms was ever permitted to use the Second Amendment as a shield from the wrath of the victor .	neutral	notsarc
at least the court made the correct decision and did n't just try to make new laws .	I do n't usually agree with you , but I agree with you on this one . The judiciary branch is there to interpret the law . Do I wish the ruling had been different and the government should have paid for the abortion ? Yes . But the court made the correct decision . It 's the same with the Terri Schiavo case . All the conservatives wanted to save her because they thought the laws were n't right but the judges all sided on the side of the law . The law is written for a reason , and we do n't get to decide when to ignore them just because of compassion . Then we fall down the slippery slope of abridging the first amendment because it 's better , and violating other laws `` for the good of the people '' . It 's like `` Animal Farm '' , where the laws kept changing ever so slightly , and soon it was no better than it was before . The laws were made , and if we want to change them , we should fight them , but court is not the place . Of course we all wish we could just go to the courts and get them to settle disputes like mommy but they are there to interpret the law , and unfortunately the law was very clear here , that in this case the government should not pay for the abortion .	agree	notsarc

Would someone care to post the `` Cliff Notes '' of ID theory ? The entire theory seems like a non-sequitor to me , at least as presented by our friendly neighborhood ID peddler . In essence , it seems as though the central claim is that nothing `` intelligent '' and no `` information '' can be be created except by a creator , and that the world as we know it could not exist without this information . Further to that , the complexity and `` order '' of the universe is evidence of the work of an intelligent designer . Is that fair enough ? So if nothing intelligent and no information can be created , how did the creator get created ? That 's step one , IMHO , and it would seem to me it all falls apart right there , but I 'm assuming I 'll get some kind of an `` always there '' or other such supernatural explanation . A luxury never afforded to the `` scientist '' side of the debate . As far as `` information '' ( I really do n't like that word anymore ) and complexity are concerned , it comes down to the available scientific explanations vs. `` you 're wrong , the creator did it '' in various forms . In other words , it essentially boils down to an entirely philosophical debate as from what I 've seen so far , it ca n't really be argued on a purely scientific level . Further to that , it would seem to me to be a very tenous position to hold to agree that micro evolution and perhaps speciation can occur , and that the world functions as it does because of `` intelligent design '' , and yet profess belief in a 6000 year old earth . In other words , I ca n't see ID theory , which seems to me to be essentially a form of theistic evolution , being compatible with Young Earth Creationism , or for that matter , with any form of literal Creationism .

As the Christian Right 's poster boy , this is hugely damaging , do n't you think ? Also makes him very hypocritical ( or , dare I say , a FLIPFLOPPER ? ! ) since he is campaigning against open abortion now .	Wow , I hope I 'm not the only person who went directly to your source to check it out . Lets review several points here : 1 ) The need to display current information . This article is almost four years old , I have yet to hear anything about this over the entire course of Mr. Bush 's presidency . George W. Bush is one of the most personally assaulted Presidents in US history , few will argue this whether they support him or not . Just about every negative thing Bush has been involved in or people speculate he was involved in has been dragged out and there any number of books with the details . This info has had little or no further data in the past 4 years . The press loves a scandal and I have yet to see them shy away from one as juicy as this if it were true . 2 ) The need to display information from a reputable source . Just to clarify Flynt is Larry Flynt since you seemed to leave this detail out . This transcript comes from a bulletin board and the sources it cites are at places like gwbushnotmypresident.com and atheist.org I 'm sure neither of these websites has an agenda . The end of the post displays an anti-Republican manifesto showing that the person who posted it did it with such impartiality . I 'm sure they are focusing on being fair and balanced . 3 ) Make sure the parts of your source that you do n't quote do n't contain info that harms your argument . Larry Flynt bases nearly all of this theory on the alleged event of Bush visiting the girl in the hospital after she had an abortion . If this ever did occur there is no evidence that Bush knew that she had an abortion . Flynt says so himself :	neutral	notsarc

You guys know me . Always happy to correct anyone . As electrolyte pointed out , ( 1 ) the first step in the scientific method is the observation . A scientist observes something that raises a question . ( 2 ) Then comes the hypothesis , that is an attempt to explain the observation . The hypothesis can be an educated guess or even wild speculation based on previous knowledge or intuition , or it may be based in previous science and an understanding of scientific principles . ( 3 ) One then makes a prediction that is a necessary consequence of the hypothesis . That science is predictive is one of its salient characteristics . In the case of the scientific method , the prediction is said to have the power to falsify the hypothesis . In other words , if the prediction can be shown to be false , then the hypothesis must also be false . If the prediction is true , then the hypothesis is supported . So now we have the observation , the hypothesis that explains the observation , and a prediction that is a consequence of the hypothesis . The next step ( 4 ) is to design an experiment to test the prediction , and then ( 5 ) to perform the test . If the prediction fails the test , then it may be abandoned . However , as electrolyte pointed out , the process may be circular , because if the prediction is falsified , additional observation from the test may be used to adjust the hypothesis at ( 2 ) , and a new prediction is made at ( 3 ) , and so on . In creation science , the process stops at ( 2 ) , except that the hypothesis is based on dogma and scripture , not reality .	Ah , thanks for the correction , although there are really many ways to state the method . Last time I checked , i believed that the observation was part of the hypothesis process , but I could be wrong .	neutral	notsarc

Well good on you for taking a proactive stance against the AiG misinformation campaign To add to what johnhanks said be careful about about insulting them- regardless of how infuriating their position is the weight of evidence and reason is firmly on the side of science .

Old Earth Creationists ) .

Note also this false statement from a `` '' Survival of the fittest '' is a poor way to think about evolution . Darwin himself never used the phrase .

Well survival of the fittest was not Darwins term- although he may of used it it the later editions of the Origin . The phase was actually coined by Herbert Spencer in 1851 . Weiner could be forgiven for his statement- if he had read the first edition of the Origin ( regarded as being the best version as it contains no responses to critiscsms that were levelled at the preceeding editions ) he would not have come across it under Darwins name .

What is science ? The first place to start is with a definition of science . Many exist , but most of them come down to something like , If something is scientific , it is observable and testable ( i.e. , able to be repeated ) . Now it might surprise readers without a scientific background to hear me say that very few scientists have any real idea what science is . However , if you are a scientist you will probably acknowledge the truth of this seemingly nonsensical statement . In my undergraduate studies and postgraduate research , I cant ever recall anyone telling me what science is ( and isnt ! ) , showing me what it is , or providing me with an explanation of how it operates . If you are studying science or working with scientists and you doubt me , I challenge you to ask them for a definition of what is scientific. After a pause , most of them would not be able to give an answer much deeper than It is what scientists do. As an undergraduate , I was taught to remember , not to think . Sure , I was given tools which I could use to think , but I wasnt actually taught to think . Then , as a Ph.D. researcher I worked in a very narrow field ( as do all Ph.D. researchers ) , and so the breadth of a question like What is the definition of scientific ?  was absolutely irrelevant to me . Upon graduation and working as a research scientist for 17 years and as a leader of other scientists , the question has never arisen , nor apparently needed to have been asked . My point is that most scientists dont really know what is or isnt scientific , because it rarely affects what they do . Why make a big deal of this ? The reason is because creation and evolution are actually both outside the realms of science and , to know this , you need to know what science isand as we have seen , most scientists dont . Neither process is currently observable , testable or repeatable . Please note that when speaking of evolution , I am talking of the appearance of new ( not rearranged ) genetic information leading to greater and greater complexity of genetic information . I am also talking about the appearance of life starting from inanimate chemicals . When talking about evolution , I am not speaking of natural selection , which leads to a reduction in genetic information in those species . Creationists , of course , have not the slightest problem with natural selection . After all , it has been practiced by farmers for centuries in their breeding of plants and animals through selecting preferred offspring and mating or propagating these . Anyway , the theory of natural selection was described by creation-believing scientists long before Darwin boarded the Beagle .	http : //www.answersingenesis.org/home ... sd/grocott.asp So who decides what is or is n't science ? If what was taught in science classes was no more controversial than the freezing point of water or the melting point of lead , then maybe it could be defined in a way that everyone could agree on . But when it gets into theories and hypothesis about one time events that happened thousands , or billions of years ago , its time to set aside what we think science is , and ask ourselves what science class is trying to accomplish . If we take students to a theoretic area where we suspect there is more to be discovered , is n't it time to consider teaching them HOW to think , not WHAT to think ? Can we do that by ruling an entire concept out , in a society that exercises free inquiry and advocates progress ? Every subject taught in school is different , but science is , ( and has to be ) about so much more than teaching prior knowledge . 2 ) Let 's look at the dictionary.com definition of religion ;	neutral	sarc

The two main problems with ID , and why it is rejected among the scientific community , are : 1 . It depends solely upon the ignorance of certain scientific disciplines and the current limits of scientific discovery . In other words , every time more information about biology is discovered , ID becomes diminished , rather than bolstered .	JUST LIKE ABIOGENESIS !

He found that adaptive genetic mutations arising systematically under these circumstances outnumbered maladaptive and inconsequential mutations to a high degree , statistically speaking . A most significant finding , and one that has been repeated again and again and again , to the point where somatic hypermutation is accepted by bacteriologists as a legitimate 'immune response ' enabling rapid adaptive [ EAM ] evolution [ antibiotic resistance ] in eusocial bacteria .	I 've examined Hall 's papers and they make interesting reading . However , further research , including some undertaken by Hall himself , has informed the debate greatly . For one thing , many of the experimental results to which Hall originally proposed sub-population hypermutation ( your 'hypermutation as a eusocial response ' ) as an explanation have proved inconsistent with that hypothesis . The Amplification Mutation model described above is a much better fit , correctly predicting such details as clonally-related bacteria possessing redundant lac- copies in addition to the lac+ revertant . The articles I 've already cited , though they focus on the Cairns system 's experimental vulnerabilities as the origin of the recent directed/adaptive mutagenesis misperception , also include Hall 's work in their assessment . Hall himself performed a followup experiment to his work on anomalous rates of trpAB+ dual revertants , acknowledging that a colleague 's suggestion , that stochastically-occurring trpA+trpB revertants were growing on waste byproducts secreted by non-growing trpAtrpB+ revertants was probably correct . In short , though hypermutation of a sub-population does occur sometimes , it is not always an organismic response ( eg mutation promoters coincidentally amplified along with useful genes ) , and the 'successful ' mutants do not always , or even mostly , arise from within that subpopulation . Also , you still seem reluctant to acknowledge the implications of the existence of a physical mechanism for hypermutation under stress . It must itself have evolved somehow - which makes it logically ( as well as empirically , as evidenced by my original post in which 4/5ths of the adaptive bacteria exhibited no increased mutation rate ) not a prerequisite for evolution . It 's just one more adaptation to the environment - in this case , the environment 's potential for inducing - though carcinogens or simple uncertainty at the molecular level - genetic change .	neutral	sarc

Evolution does not prove or disprove anything . It offers an explanation of why things are as they are , and is considered by far the most likely explanation of the explanations available . This is ever the way of science : observe what is around you and try to find an explanation , then verify if the explanation holds true . This is also the reason why these debates still exist : because they are waged in the wrong direction . `` Prove evolution ! '' `` No you prove creation ! Prove god ! '' `` No , you disprove god ! '' leads nowhere . We 're looking at the world , and wonder what makes it tick because we are naturally curious ( according to evolutionists , probably because apes curious about `` what is making that tall grass sway when there is no wind '' got to live longer , the longer life being spent on having more . According to creationist , because god made us so . ) . Understanding the world is generally useful , since we get creative ideas about how to keep it as it is when we like it or how to change it when we do n't like it . Possible explanations pop up all the time and as they are mutually exclusive , we usually try to see which one is more likely . None can ever be proven true . For all we know , god may indeed have created the world 6000 years ago and then spend an enormous amount of effort to make it look waaay older . Of course , such a god either has a great sense of ( I tremble at thinking about what his idea of a practical joke might be ) or is a rather individual . Or dividual , no one ever explained how god/s might procreate .	i think i like this answer because they said it offered an explanation . and you also have a choice to belive that explanation . becuase several.. not too smart people ... developed other ideas of how this magnificent earth got here . oh and johnhanks i will never believe evolution . and that my opinion . and im not saying has to believe it i just wanted to know your take on this question .	neutral	sarc
1 ) How long does intelligent design take , x years or is it instantaneous ? 2 ) By what mechanism does the designer interact with the natural world ? 3 ) When and why does the designer choose to interact with the world ? 4 ) Why has the vast majority of intelligently designed life ceased to exist ? if it was designed correctly in the first place why was it necessary to discard so many forms and replace them with different ones , as evidenced by the fossil record ? 5 ) What experiments have been conducted to verify the occurence of intelligent design ?	May I attempt to respond as an IDist would respond ? 1 ) If God -- err , the designer can pop IC systems into existence at will , do n't you think He ... /she/it can do so any way he/she/it damn well pleases ? See also answer 2 . 2 ) IDists need no mechanistic explanation . The idea that evidence for design means design stands by itself . ( Nevermind that the crux of ID is that it demands an evolutionary mechanism for the appearance of alleged IC/ '' unevolvable '' systems ; the ID philosophy totally sidesteps that requirement . ) 3 ) Again , the validity of ID depends not on the designer 's choices but only on the designer interacting at all . 4 ) OEC/IDists will claim that environmental conditions have changed over millions of years just like mainstream science says they have ; after all , some IDists `` do n't doubt '' mechanisms such as natural selection . For the obvious problem of the designer `` letting '' species go extinct , see answer 3 . I 'm guessing that YEC/IDists will just point to the flood . And the conspiracy theorist/IDists will blame Satan for trying to mislead people . 5 ) Not a single one . ( Either that answer , or maybe `` Well , uh , has n't Behe done something by now ? `` , which still means none . ) So there you have it . An evolutionist 's formulation of an IDists response . Appropriately , because ID as a whole is essentially an argument from ignorance , ignorance plays a role the answers to all your questions . ( `` Do n't know '' / '' Do n't care '' / '' Does n't matter . '' ) ID simply sidesteps these issues . Also notice that none of the statements are testable or falsifiable , except for the parts of the OEC view that are perfectly compatible with geology and evolution . Some will claim that they `` have no reason '' to doubt common descent ( a la Behe ) but do a conspicuously good job of not saying they actually believe it .

Translation : Anti-abortionist intellectuals are n't really opposed to abortion as an end in itself , they only oppose abortion because they believe forcing women to remain pregnant is an appropriate punishment for their True Sin , sex outside of marriage . The goal is n't to `` prevent murder '' at all , this is merely a convenient excuse to punish women who stray from traditional relationships . That 's why those opposed to abortion are also opposed to contraception , even though contraception prevents abortion . So the fact that abortion protestors also prevent people from accessing contraception is n't contradictory at all , it is completely in line with their goals .	disagree	sarc

So , what 's my point in all this ? I 'm not trying to say that Unkerpaulie 's doctrine is wrong . I 'm just trying to show that it 's pefectly possible to believe in Christianity and the Bible without believing in a literal Genesis , Fall , or Creation , and so there 's no necessary conflict between being a good Christian and believing evolution . There are certainly certain branches of Christianity for which evolution is anathema , but that 's a property of those particular branches , and not an inherent property of Christianity as a whole .	i wouls suggest that `` brand '' of christianity that doesnt take genesis as literal is based on an unbiblical doctrine . as you demonstrated above , in order to remove the significance of genesis , you must fill in the gaps with explanations that are not based on , and sometimes contrary to , the bible . clearly , why even call that a christian if they are not folowing the pattern of christ , dont believe in redemption and original sin , and dont believe that this very redemption restores man back to the form man was originally intended to live . that said , i 'm very curious to hear exactly how this `` brand '' of christian fits evolution into the scripture as a basis for their christianity . in order to do that , they 'd need to : - understand exactly what the `` allegory '' of genesis represents - explain how man can be considered in the likeness of God presently - explain exactly why jesus died if there is no original sin - identify the time in history that God was first revealed to man - account for the souls of the homonid species before modern man so far , noone has even ever come close to scratching the surface on these questions . in fact , members of this `` brand '' of christianity become VERY hard to find when discussions like these arise . yet they are quick to pat themselves on the back for `` not being like those fundamentalists who reject science '' . if your version of christianity is the right one , lets discuss it	neutral	sarc

That does n't mean that their version of 'the line ' should automatically be the legal one . At the moment ( in the UK , at least ) , that line is legally drawn at the point when the baby becomes viable ; that is , when it could potentially survive a premature birth .

If you are an isolated group of animals , and you have enough mutations and mating , you will change over time . The environment , through one process , can choose who succeeds and who does n't . It 's natural selection . There are other mechanisms , of course , so that 's not the only one . We already know that Human brain development could possible have occured due to a new diet , in a new area . Meat allowed for a larget brain , which in turn allowed for better skills , compared to other animals . Humans used tools as well , which was aided by using hands .

To call an issue `` settled law '' is , as someone else pointed out , to emphasize stare decisis , i.e . `` to stand by what has been decided , '' i.e . to recognize the binding nature of precedent . This is why , in those rare cases where long-standing precedents are overturned , it 's such a big deal : the court essentially admits that it had been wrong . As to so-called `` judicial activism '' -- and again as someone else pointed out -- to emphasize stare decisis is preciesly the opposite of `` judicial activism . '' With regard to Roe itself , what I find remarkable is that the court exercised so much restraint : the justices explicitly refused to make a declaration about when life begins . They explicitly claimed not to have any qualifications to make such a decision , and they noted that even those who examine the issue thoroughly -- scientists and physicians , theologians and philosophers -- are nowhere near a consensus on the matter . So they decided not step in and settle such metaphysical questions . Indeed , it is ultimately individuals whom the court allowed to make this decision as they see fit . And so , they based the decision on the right to privacy . Said right is not explicit in the Constitution , but that does n't matter ( see the Ninth Amendment for why ) . And said right is also not absolute ( as the decision again explicitly says ) : it is limited in this case by the state 's compelling interest in protecting prenatal life ( a point which is often overlooked by all sides in the abortion debate ) , and that interest is directly proportional to the viability of the fetus . But what Roe clarified is that any law establishing the protection of prenatal life as an unconditional trump of the mother 's right to privacy is unconstitutional . Within reasonable limits , she herself gets to decide when life begins , and to act accordingly . Like I said , judicial restraint . And a stunning example of defending the individual from government interference or social discrimination in matters of conscience , to boot .	disagree	sarc
The theory of aggregated production , which is the point of the following book , nevertheless can be much easier adapted to the conditions of a totalitarian state [ eines totalen Staates ] than the theory of production and distribution of a given production put forth under conditions of free competition and a large degree of laissez-faire . This is one of the reasons that justifies the fact that I call my theory a general theory . Since it is based on fewer hypotheses than the orthodox theory , it can accommodate itself all the easier to a wider field of varying conditions . Although I have , after all , worked it out with a view to the conditions prevailing in the Anglo-Saxon countries where a large degree of laissez-faire still prevails , nevertheless it remains applicable to situations in which state management is more pronounced . For the theory of psychological laws which bring consumption and saving into relationship with each other , the influence of loan expenditures on prices , and real wages , the role played by the rate of interestall these basic ideas also remain under such conditions necessary parts of our plan of thought .

The Supreme Sovereign ordered the water god Gong Gong to create a flood as punishment and warning for human misbehavior . Gong Gong extended the flood for 22 years , and people had to live in high mountain caves and in trees , fighting with wild animals for scarce resources . Unable to persuade the Supreme Sovereign to stop the flood , and told by an owl and a turkey about _Xirang_ or Growing Soil , the supernatural hero Gun stole Growing Soil from heaven to dam the waters . Before Gun was finished , however , the Supreme Sovereign sent the fire god Zhu Rong to execute him for his theft . The Growing Soil was taken back to heaven , and the floods continued . However , Gun 's body did n't decay , and when it was cut apart three years later , his son Yu emerged in the form of a horned dragon . Gun 's body also transformed into a dragon at that time and thenceforth lived quietly in the deeps . The Supreme Sovereign was fearful of Yu 's power , so he cooperated and gave Yu the Growing Soil and the use of the dragon Ying . Yu led other gods to drive away Gong Gong , distributed the Growing Soil to remove most of the flood , and led the people to fashion rivers from Ying 's tracks and thus channel the remaining floodwaters to the sea .

Do n't count on it . The number of scientists in the American scientific community that subscribe to creationism is about % 5 , based upon a relatively recent poll . I will try to dig it up .

EXTREME minority . Pandions ascertations are rediculous . In the end , the decision will be made based on the accuracy of the proposal , nothing else . Back in 1999 when they removed macro evolution from the curriculum requirements , they did so because their science advisory board , a board composed of college professors from our state colleges , including a couple of folks who are cinsidered some fo the top biologists in the world , told them unanimously that while macro evolution was the best theory we currently have , it may be wrong . Apparently while there is a huge amount of data and emprical evidence to support micro evolution , the same body of evidence does not necessarily prove macro evolution . Panion is simply a zealot on the other side of the issue from the YEC folks . He/She sees gloom and doom for anybody that dares approach the theory .

Not just a new function , an irreducibly complex new function : [ b ] Significantly , when Hall looked at the control regions of the mutant replacement gene , he found that they had been mutated as well - some of them were now switched on all the time , but a few of them responded directly to lactose , switching the gene on and off as needed . ... .

' It is these kinds of articles that are so transparently silly that really irritate me . An evolutionary mutation of a gene is : a new and useful gene that never b4 existed , bring new body structures and functions that never b4 existed . Switching genes on and off is why built in redundancy has generated such a wide variety of creatures in such a wide variety of environments . There has NEVER been 1 example of a newly created gene that provided a new beneficial function based entirely on new information forming on the gene .

Almost , and this is why I start the entire debate from the begining . Your concept of God is the irrational claim , that leads , inevitably , to a string of reason based firmly on an irrational or illogical premise . This is no great feat , we can all make a reasonable mountain of claims based on a single irrational premise . You do n't NEED reason , you have faith , it 's the opposite of reason .	Your concept of there being no God is an irrational claim , that leads , inevitably , to a string of reason based firmly on an irrational or illogical premise . I copied your words as it may be easiest to for you to understand the point I am trying to make . The use of God is a rational assumption . Your use of there not being a God is an assumption . By definition of reason , it is the intellectual faculaty by which conclusions are drawn from premises . On the existence of a rational Creator who made us in His image , our `` intellectual faculty '' would also be made in His image . Thus it is rational and logical . Hence , the conclusion that we come to from the premise that God exists is rational and logical . While evolution says we are accidents , and hence , our brain patterns that governs our logic and ability to reason must also be accidnets ( i.e we would be irrational and illogical ) . After reasoning , the conclusions we came to would be most likely irrational and illogical . As you can see from the definition of reason , it depends on your starting faith or belief systems as to what conclusion you will come to . Another word for this faith is assumptions .	disagree	sarc

Guidance by humans in the blind Watchmaker does not stop it being a reasonable analogy for his idea that no higher intelligence is in evolution but it can produce . In the analogy the guidance by humans represents natural selection . You could represent the rules of natural selection as set of equations with random elements that contained no human ingenuity instead but I do n't see it as a crime to use a human forced to act under restrictions to represent that has nothing to do with humans . I will show you You could describe electrons as things that hate other electrons but like positive charges . If some electrons see other electrons coming at them down a wire they will also move down the wire to avoid them . If it means going through a circuit an powering a light globe to do the electrons will still flow if the circuit is complete . Now lets think about whats happening , each indivual electron hates large group of electrons coming towards it but to get out of the way it will have to get closer to other electrons ( those punks ) . So if you increased the cross sectional area of the wire then the resistance will decrease . What about a double adaptor ? All it does is let the current go through two different circuits . Now if there are two light globes will they both glow half as bright ? No . Why because the resistance is halved and there will be twice as much total electron flow . A lot of laws in electric circuit theory made sense to me when I imagined I was an electron going through a wire and how happy I would be going down a wire . Electrons are not happy but I still had an analogy that gave me answers so I was happy . I would have been better off being told that voltage is joules per coloumb so the voltage drop between circuits must be the same .	Again , it 's not the point . There are many who do n't deny evolution , they believe it was guided . Showing examples of guidence - through artificial selection supports this theory	disagree	notsarc

However , the AIG does list Thomas Barnes who 's highest earned degree is an MS in physics , his Sc.D being honorary from his undergraduate , Christian university . Clifford Burdick has a `` degree '' from a non-university ( as described in the mimeographed bulletin of the `` University of Physical Sciences '' , from which Burdick claimed his degree : `` 'The University is not an educational institution , but a society of individuals of common interest for the advancement of physical science .

Harold Slusher has an honorary degree from a Bible college with only a 1/2 man graduate science department in addition to his `` degree '' from Columbia Pacific University a non-accredited correspondence school that promises a degree in less than a year . I do note that Clifford Burdick is listed on list of deceased scientists who believed in a creator . I presume that the rest of the `` scientists '' listed by AIG actually have the PhDs that AIG claims of all 182 listed . I invite you to compare that list to the Steve list , now at 720+ scientists named Steve who accept evolution as the correct explanation for the observed diversity of life . The name `` Steve '' ( and variations thereof ) comprises about 1 % of the population . The percentage of qualified scientists with that name can not be far from the norm .

However , there are also scientists in fields such as cosmology and astrophysics that are signatories as well as other fields with an interest in evolutionary theory . For example , Stephen Hawking has signed the Steve list . I invite you to find bogus and inappropriate degrees on the Steve list . I am sure that the NCSE would be appreciative of your efforts . Hopefully you will have a more difficult time than I did in identifying bogus degrees . Oh , yes . In my experience , creationist scientists were always creationist long before they were scientists .

`` There is no proof that God exists '' is quite accurate . Only the deepest philosophy will come to the point of seriously debating the fault in the statement , which is that as we are posessed of imperfect knowledge we can not deny the possibility that some as yet undiscovered proof of god might exist . In this case , we 'd modify the statement to `` There is no known proof that God exists . '' However , in the context , what you are doing is not deep philosophy , but nitpicking . As for the laws of logic , once more I shall try to explain from another angle : logic , mathematics and similar are ways in which we describe the universe . Take an apple . Take another apple . Now you have two apples , but you do n't actually have two of the same things . You just recognize that apples are similar one to another and that it is reasonable to invent the nonexistent context of an abstract apple .	All you have said is there are two apples . I noticed you said describe , I can describe what a chair is , but that description is not the chair itself . Are the apples the `` law of non-contradiction '' ?	disagree	sarc

Consciousness , along with human DNA .

But I actally disagreewith `` consciousness '' being a necessary quality of `` human beings '' , since it 's unreasonable to believe that we stop being people when we go to sleep . But maybe you have a more nuanced definition of `` consciousness '' .	neutral	notsarc
So , I could certainly see , if variation was truly random that selection could theoretically pick from a pool of random variants . Unfortunately for evolutionists , the concept of randomness when it comes to new traits has never actually been proven . In fact , whenever animals experience an environmental shift , they have this bad habit of shifting right along with it , starting with an internal response from each creature who somehow `` senses '' this change . It 's hardly logical to call this random . But if each individual of a population experiences the same environmental cue , and each member simultaneously evolves the same traits epigenetically , not only will this speed up evolution exponentially , but it will also give each member the same traits at the same time -- which ultimately gives them the same basic fitness -- -- - which undermines natural selection , making mortality/breeding success mostly a lottery of circumstance , with a little sexual selection thrown in .	Well , yes , but this begs the question of whether , even assuming epigenetic inheritance is real , all individuals would experience the same epigenetic alterations . Now , I have no problem with the concept of epigenetic inheritance . But even if it were true it would n't do away with natural selection . Just as with basic genetic mutation , which is n't going to go away , one would expect some individuals to exhibit epigenetic alterations and others not to . This still means a population containing a range of variants that natural selection can act on , preserving some epigenetic alterations as opposed to others . Of course , if the claim is that epigenetic alterations are somehow directed by the environment , i.e . are teleological in origin , then the onus is on the advocates to demonstrate how this direction occurs . Until they do , there is no reason to suppose there is any direction at all .	neutral	sarc

Any two adults can run the household , one can make the decision if the other is incapacitated , one inherits when the other dies , etc etc . That parallel does not carry over to group marriages . When one dies , who inherits ? If one is incapacitied , who decides what the treatment should be ? Basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two , so recongnising group marriages is a huge legal task , and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious . If we 're talking about legal recognition , and we are ( right ? ) , then the cases are wildly different . Our marriage laws , for better or worse , are set up on the assumption of two adults running a household . They also assume man and wife , true , but do n't actually depend on that . But the dependence on there being two people is embedded in the laws ; changing that is a huge project .	Yes , but gays would also want laws changed to accomodate THEIR form of marriage as well . The fact that one requires less change than the other should n't matter , should it ? Should having to do more reworking of laws and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality ? It seems to me your argument boils down to `` polygamy requires more work to make the laws accomodate it . '' Yeah -- such is the price for marriage equality . Let 's face it -- if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for opposite-sex couples which comprise most relationships , they could pull it off -- polygamy , gays , letting 17 year olds marry , etc . All those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed . Means could be set up to determine inheritance , for example . Laws can be worded to do it .	disagree	notsarc

Society 's willingness to impose on women alone the sacrifice required by laws restricting abortion , unique within the landscape of Anglo-American law , may well reflect a deeply held traditional view of the differences in character of the sexes . While we might not impose selflessness and virtuous behavior on a man ... .some may find it less of a contradiction to impose such virtue on a woman because of the traditional view of her nature . But to impose virtue on ANY person demeans that person 's individual worth . It is no more acceptable when the person is a woman than a man . There should be no 'woman 's exception ' to our traditional regard for individualism and autonomy . As long as these values remain at the core of our legal system , there is thus a powerful case for the conclusion that laws prohibiting abortion -- even IF the fetus is regarded as a person -- deny women the equal protection of the laws guaranteed to all by the 14th amendment . And if this is so , then perhaps the Roe decision , by gratuitously insisting that the fetus can not be deemed a person , needlessly insulted and alienated those for whom the view that the fetus is a person represents a fundamental article of faith or a bedrock personal committment . Perhaps as Yale Law School Dean Guido Calabresi has suggested , the Roe opinion for no good reason said to a large and politically active group `` [ y ] our metaphysics are not part of our Constitution .

It sure is funny how many times the `` pro-lifers '' claim a victory- and yet that victory is quickly overturned by the supreme authority in this country- which is not the senate , not the president , it is the COURT . I find it truly insulting that this great nation , which was founded upon the idea of religious freedom has allowed so many of its laws to be affected by the over-dominant christian right . If we put aside the bible , the commandments , and the intentionally biased commentaries of christian leaders , what argument is left ? The Christian right will say that all life is precious , but obviously there are tiers . An unborn , unwanted , and even sometimes malformed child is more precious than that of the mother . Who cares if she was raped ? Who cares if she was the victim of incest ? Who cares if the child she carries has tested positive for all sorts of defects- `` My preacher says it 's wrong ! '' Another disturbing all too common event is that of the woman who has taken her prescribed birth control , but it failed , so she finds herself carrying a child she never wanted , and even worse , as a result of the augmented hormone levels as a result of birth control , her child has little chance of being born normal and healthy . But if these `` pro-lifers '' have their way , she will be forced to have the child , and raise it . Another argument I often hear is the option of adoption . One must wonder , though , if adoptive families were so abundant , why so many group homes for unwanted children who are doomed to live out their childhoods at the knees of the state ? The gross majority of open-adoption agencies out there are christian-founded , which means of course , that unless you adhere to their strict guidelines , you will not recieve a child . Single parents ( no matter the income ) homosexuals , any person who does not subscribe to christianity is immediately disqualified !

GEOLOGY : The Calibration of Ediacaran Time Alan J. Kaufman* More than a century ago , the last great geological period was formally ratified by an international committee . This was the final rocky step in the subdivision of deep time based on the evolutionary progression of animal fossils . However , recent years have seen the identification of an older and tumultuous new interval , the Ediacaran Period , during which Earth 's earliest soft-bodied organisms emerged in the oceans . This interval was recently ratified ( 1 ) , underscoring advances in the absolute dating ( 2-6 ) and worldwide correlation of geological strata that were deposited in isolated basins before true animals exploded onto the scene in the succeeding Cambrian Period . On page 95 of this issue , Condon et al . ( 7 ) present precise age constraints for the Ediacaran Period . The authors have analyzed volcanic dust in two key depositional layers in the Doushantuo Formation of southern China . Their radiometric dates provide important insights into the rates of geological and evolutionary processes . The first layer , with an age of about 635 million years , is at the base of the new interval , whereas the second , at about 550 million years , may constrain the age of an environmental disaster ( 8-10 ) that is closely associated with the rapid diversification of the Ediacara biota ( see the figure ) that lend their name to the new Period . http : //www.sciencemag.org/content/vo ... m/59-1-med.gif Figure 1 Early animals ? A pile of three-dimensionally preserved casts of the soft-bodied Ediacaran organism Ernietta from ~545 million-year-old sediments in the Nama Group of southern Namibia . The scale bar corresponds to 15 cm . Convention previously focused on the evolutionary first appearance of a specific fossil or assemblage to define the beginning of new geological periods . In contrast , the beginning of the Ediacaran period is defined by the base of a marine carbonate rock , which formed in southern Australia in the aftermath of a distinctive and potentially global ice age ( 11 , 12 ) . Equivalent glacial rocks occur immediately beneath similar carbonates at the base of the Doushantuo Formation . In the area studied by Condon et al. , the new ages constrain the Doushantuo Formation , which represents most of the Ediacaran Period , to some 85 million years -- a remarkably long interval for only about 100 m of rock . This observation begs the question : How much time may be missing in Ediacaran strata from southern China ? In the absence of dates between the two radiometric tie points , one must consider two possibilities : Either the sediments accumulated continuously , albeit slowly ( some two orders of magnitude more slowly than in similar environments of the same age ) , or there are breaks in time ( hiatuses or unconformities ) hidden within the poorly exposed layers . On the basis of limited physical data , Condon et al . suggest the presence of two such unconformities in their study area near the Yangtze Gorges . The duration of these stratigraphic breaks with respect to the environmental anomaly -- reflecting a dramatic change in the cycling of carbon on Earth 's surface -- and subsequent biological innovations form the cornerstone of their conclusions , and deserve closer examination . Spectacular fossil animal embryos ( 13 , 14 ) of great evolutionary importance are found at Weng'an ( some 375 km to the southwest of the authors ' study area ) , where the Doushantuo Formation accumulated closer to the shoreline and records only a single surface of unconformity . In such nearshore environments , oceanic sediments are often exposed above sea level , resulting in the removal of underlying sediments and hence the erasure of some fraction of geological time . Which of the two hiatal surfaces from the deeper-water sections at the Yangtze Gorges correlates to the single unconformity at Weng'an ? The data are more equivocal than presented by Condon et al. , and the choice carries important evolutionary consequences . At the Yangtze Gorges , the extraordinary carbon cycle anomaly recorded in marine carbonates near the top of the Doushanto Formation is truncated by the uppermost unconformity . Condon et al . suggest that there is little time missing across the surface , thereby preserving a causal relation between the environmental perturbation and the rapid diversification of Ediacara organisms and associated faunas around 550 million years ago . However , correlation of this surface and the intervening sediments back to Weng'an tells another story . At Weng'an , both the carbon cycle anomaly and the sediments typical of the uppermost Doushantuo Formation at the Yangtze Gorges are missing , implying a substantial hiatus . Comparison of broadly equivalent strata in southern Australia and the western United States suggests a stratigraphic architecture similar to that in southern China , where similar carbon cycle anomalies are truncated by unconformities ( 15 ) . In the western United States , the post-anomaly unconformity removes a minimum of 130 m of section , more than the entire thickness of the Doushantuo Formation . These observations suggest that the unconformity separating the Ediacaran faunas and the carbon cycle anomaly in southern China may , in fact , hide a lot of time , thereby decoupling the environmental and biological events that the authors wish to connect . This is not meant to detract from the important radiometric calibration that Condon et al . provide , but rather to note that the stratigraphic relations between these dates , and therefore their connection to evolutionary events , are far from straightforward . According to Condon et al. , the rapid diversification of complex multicellular organisms in Ediacaran oceans forced the carbon cycle anomaly seen worldwide , but this seems possible only if there is no real time missing across the upper Doushantuo unconformity . If this is not the case , then this interpretation may be placing the cart before the horse . Alternative models suggest that environmental changes may have driven evolutionary transformations . In particular , atmospheric oxygen -- long believed to be an external forcing factor to evolution -- appears to have built up rapidly during the Ediacaran Period , not because of a discrete biological event but as a result of the tectonic forces that lift and erode mountain ranges ( 16 ) . Through precise radiometric clocks and clever stratigraphic connections , geoscientists can increasingly correlate Ediacaran sediments that are separated widely in space and time . These tools allow us to piece together a complex puzzle of unforgettable biological events against a background of repetitive climatic and environmental perturbations . However , even with exact dates , the cyclicity of these events and the specter of a fragmentary rock record add uncertainty to our picture of Ediacaran Earth history . References 1 . A. H.

Sorry to tell you this , but Behe already refuted the idea : The important question for us biochemists is , can symbiosis explain the origin of complex biochemical systems ? Clearly it can not . The essence of symbiosis is the joining of separate cells , or two separate systems , both of which are already functioning ... Because symbiosis starts with complex , already functioning systems it can not account for the fundamental biochemical systems we have discussed in this book. ( Darwins Black Box , page189 )	And once again , is this a strong enough rebuttal to assert proof ? no , Behe assumes that a biochemical system that exists today can not have a precursor , or less complex state of existence .

If all life evolved from a common ancestor , then there should be countless instances of new body parts evolving . Body parts such as eyes , muscle , bone , etc . We have not seen one instance of a new body part evolving in a population in which it has not existed previously . Evolutionists will wave the magic `` time wand '' and simply claim that such a change could never be observed in a few decades . What about fruit flies ? One generation of fruit flies = around a day . Fruit flies were exposed to x rays to speed up mutation rates , we have observed the equivalent of millions of years ( in terms of human generations ) of super-accelerated mutation and ... . no new body parts . Evolutionists will also list in steps how a new body part can arise . This is only plausible if each of those steps could be directly observed . If not , then it is nothing more than science fiction . Evolutionists have been searching for any direct evidence of the theory of evolution since the 1800 's . They are still looking .	What you are talking about is irreducible complexity ; it is the only argument against evolution that appears to be totally immune to rebuttal . I have thought this issue is far over debated like gay issues but perhaps that are because I have an objectivist view point . I do n't suppose any evolutionist have realized that all the evidence for evolution is also evidence for ID . They often talk about the mountains of irrefutable evidence , but the fact that the sun rose and set every day was evidence for the sun orbiting the earth , but it 's also evidence for the earth spinning . Likewise all the evidence for evolution can be condensed into one statement `` life forms are similar to other life forms '' , This is predicted by the intelligent design hypothesis as well . Direct evidence for ID that would not support evolution would be irreducibly complex biology , direct evidence for evolution that would not support ID would be more than just adaptation , it would have to be original useful DNA , or a simulation showing that coherent structure can be achieved without intelligent design by randomization and elimination .	neutral	notsarc
HUNTSVILLE , AL  Jesus Christ , son of God and noted pro-life activist , killed two and critically wounded seven others when He opened fire in the waiting room of a Huntsville abortion clinic Tuesday . Security guards at the Women 's Medical Clinic of Huntsville were able to disarm the Messiah before He could reload His weapon , a secondhand Glock 9mm pistol that authorities said He purchased legally at a Jackson , MS , sporting-goods store . `` Abortion is a sin , '' said Christ as He was led away in handcuffs . `` It is an abomination in the eyes of Me . '' Witnesses said the attack , which took the lives of Dr. Nelson Woodring , 51 , and clinic nurse Danielle Costa , 29 , came from `` out of nowhere . '' `` He walked up to the admissions desk and asked if He could see Dr. Woodring , '' receptionist Iris Reid said . `` The next thing I knew , He was shouting Biblical verses and opening fire on everything moving . '' `` It was horrible , '' said injured clinic nurse Jessica Combs , recovering at a local hospital with bullet wounds to the leg and abdomen . `` He put his hands over Dr. Woodring 's head and told him He forgave him for his sins , and then He shot him right in the face . '' Huntsville police officials are not certain how the Messiah was able to bypass clinic guards and proceed undetected past security cameras and into the clinic waiting room , where He produced the gun from its hiding place in the folds of His robe . Federal investigators are similarly baffled , saying that the heavily armed Christ had moved in `` mysterious ways . '' Speaking to reporters from His holding cell , Christ , 33 , said He had `` no regrets '' about what He had done . `` As I said in John 16:21 , every life is precious , '' Christ said . `` This means every life , not just those who have already been born . My father , the Lord , feels the same way I do . In Jeremiah 1:5 , He said unto the prophet Jeremiah , 'Before I formed you in the womb I knew you , before you were born I set you apart . ' The unborn fetus is a sacred , living creation of my Father in Heaven and should be treated as such . '' Added Christ : `` What if the Virgin Mary had decided to abort me ? Certainly she must have been tempted to do so . After all , it was n't even her decision to conceive me in the first place . But in the end , she made the right decision , bringing her pregnancy to term and giving the world a Savior . Blessed is she among women .

Our standard expectation of evolution -- slow , steady , gradual improvement , hence change , through time -- is indeed a myth .

Evolution  the proposition that all organisms are related  is as highly verified a thesis as can be found in science . Subjected to close scrutiny from all angles for over a century now , evolution emerges as the only naturalistic explanation we have of the twin patterns of similarity and diversity that pervade all life . The basic notion that life has evolved is as certain as the existence of gravity or the idea that the earth is spheroidal . We call such highly verified notions facts when they consistently escape all attempts to prove them false . Evolution is no myth . '' Finally , please present evidence .	neutral	notsarc

This would imply that things such as 'love ' are not 'true ' because they ca n't be measured by science .	Are you sure ? Love is an emotion . Do my cat and my dog love me ? They certainly have emotions . Tell you what . Why do n't you propose a method by which `` love '' can be quantified . That way there would be no question as to whether it was scientific or not . I think that it comes back to your constant insistance that science denies anything that is non-material just because science admits a lack of tools to study the topic . Put up or shut up . How can I measure the love for my wife and children and quantify it . Do I have a limited amount of love such that I love my wife less because I also love my children ? Do I love one child more ? How is this scientific ? Are you so unable to grasp the ideas expressed that you still have n't realized that naturalistic science does not deny that there are things that can not be measured by science . Science does not deny any god . Neither can it support a god .	disagree	sarc

Human beings only have two ways to deal with one another : reason and force . If you want me to do something for you , you have a choice of either convincing me via argument , or force me to do your bidding under threat of force . Every human interaction falls into one of those two categories , without exception . Reason or force , that 's it . In a truly moral and civilized society , people exclusively interact through persuasion . Force has no place as a valid method of social interaction , and the only thing that removes force from the menu is the personal firearm , as paradoxical as it may sound to some . When I carry a gun , you can not deal with me by force . You have to use reason and try to persuade me , because I have a way to negate your threat or employment of force . The gun is the only personal weapon that puts a 100-pound woman on equal footing with a 220-pound mugger , a 75-year old retiree on equal footing with a 19-year old gangbanger , and a single gay guy on equal footing with a carload of drunk guys with baseball bats . The gun removes the disparity in physical strength , size , or numbers between a potential attacker and a defender . There are plenty of people who consider the gun as the source of bad force equations . These are the people who think that we 'd be more civilized if all guns were removed from society , because a firearm makes it easier for a mugger to do his job . That , of course , is only true if the mugger 's potential victims are mostly disarmed either by choice or by legislative fiat -- it has no validity when most of a mugger 's potential marks are armed . People who argue for the banning of arms ask for automatic rule by the young , the strong , and the many , and that 's the exact opposite of a civilized society . A mugger , even an armed one , can only make a successful living in a society where the state has granted him a force monopoly . Then there 's the argument that the gun makes confrontations lethal that otherwise would only result in injury . This argument is fallacious in several ways . Without guns involved , confrontations are won by the physically superior party inflicting overwhelming injury on the loser . People who think that fists , bats , sticks , or stones do n't constitute lethal force watch too much TV , where people take beatings and come out of it with a bloody lip at worst . The fact that the gun makes lethal force easier works solely in favor of the weaker defender , not the stronger attacker . If both are armed , the field is level . The gun is the only weapon that 's as lethal in the hands of an octogenarian as it is in the hands of a weightlifter . It simply would n't work as well as a force equalizer if it was n't both lethal and easily employable . When I carry a gun , I do n't do so because I am looking for a fight , but because I 'm looking to be left alone . The gun at my side means that I can not be forced , only persuaded . I do n't carry it because I 'm afraid , but because it enables me to be unafraid . It does n't limit the actions of those who would interact with me through reason , only the actions of those who would do so by force . It removes force from the equation ... and that 's why carrying a gun is a civilized act .	Just in case you missed it :	neutral	notsarc

The militia of the Second Amendment is a militia that is described as being well regulated (regulated by both the federal government and the states as spoken of in Article 1 of the Constitution). In our own day, I think the National Guard would be the only militia that qualifies as being well regulated. Alexander Hamilton spoke of the desirability of the militia being well regulated:"It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects, whenever they were called into service for the public defense. It would enable them to discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army; and it would fit them much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be essential to their usefulness. This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority. It is, therefore, with the most evident propriety, that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the Union "to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, RESERVING TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS, AND THE AUTHORITY OF TRAINING THE MILITIA ACCORDING TO THE DISCIPLINE PRESCRIBED BY CONGRESS."The Federalist Papers - THOMAS (Library of Congress)We could go back to the days when most citizens were required to enroll in the militia, have guns and get military training- to what the Founders really meant when they spoke of a well regulated militia being the security of a free state. But the Supreme Court along with pro-gun activists claiming to be pro- Second Amendment have decided to turn their back on that part of the Second Amendment while giving the lip service to the idea of a militia.	Well regulated as in the second amendment does not mean regulated by the government, it means well equiped and prepared. The framers of the constitution often spoke of a tyrannical government and how to keep one from coming to power, so why in the hell would they have said lets just give the government total control of guns. Your definition of well regulated makes about as much sense as adding another day to the week.	notsarc

it is hard to believe that it won't draw attention away from everyone else. but everyone will get it and it will draw attention away from the families that are there supporting their kids...and the fact still remains that your goal is to influence (or show) the administration when it should be to give your child a good time.  when your purpose is to draw attention it is hard to imagine that it wouldn't take it away from the main purpose. think of it this way...you have 1 camera at the event...you hear about this 't-shirt' thing and all of a sudden the camera is not focusing on the kid tripping over himself to roll the egg but to gay parents wearing these t-shirts and them talking about how they are great parents. my question is...if you are such great parents why aren't you with your kid instead of talking to the tv camera about your personal message? i don't buy it anymore than if someone got a big group together and had t-shirts that said 'i chose life for my child!'.	Ahh but what if all the shirts have only american flags on them. Would it them be a group of patiotic americans and their children? I mean you do tend to see american flag wear, including tee shirts, everywhere. Would it still be considered a protest if all of them had american flag shirts on them.  AHHHH Joe I it hit me of course this is like Ghandis' salt march.	sarc
No it f****n' isn't! If that was the case then Plessy v. Ferguson should have been used as precedent for all the following cases that dealt with segregation and racism. In Plessy the Supreme Court ruled that black men weren't entitled to the same facilities as white men, rather they had to have their own private facilities, separate from those of white men.Forget precedent, the Supreme Court should instead focus on what is truly constitutional regardless of what previous judges have ruled.

all the laws in the world won't work, criminals will always be able to get guns. if they can't buy them, smuggle them in or steal them, they will make them. criminals have even made guns inside maximum security prisons. follow the link. gun-making as a cottage industry	you must be joking. i'm sure that making a gun is quite a bit more complicated than making a paper airplane. then why do nations which ban guns have a much lower gun crime rate than the us? if what you say is true then we would expect to see the same amount of gun crime in nations which ban guns as in the us, but we don't.	notsarc
Okay, here is how it went: God made the animals. He said,"Hey, Adam needs a helper." He brought the animals to Adam to name. He couldn't find a helper for Adam. He then took a rib out of Adam's side to create Eve. This was done on the sixth day. God created them both on the sixth day, Adam first, then Eve out of Adam's side after he had Adam name the animals.	That interpretation is fine except that God says, "I WILL make a helper suitable for him." He hadn't made the animals yet in verse 18, but he created Adam in verse 7.	notsarc

Why is it ok for your side to determine what is right for society but when I offer my vote/opinion, I am imposing something evil on you?	Let me explain this to you.You want to stop abortions for someone else. You want to take a womans right to choose away. Where as Jito supporting a womans right to choose does not impose upon your life in any way.You want to stop me from being able to marry this does not effect your life in any way yet has a devastationg effect on my life. The left supports rights while your side want to limit the rights of others.You want to stop me from being able to marry because you have a religious belief against it even though I may have a religious belief that supports it. Therefore you are imposing your religious and moral views on me when I do not share those beliefs.	notsarc
I've got no problem with it. Geez, your not normal if you don't have it circumcised. Some woman won't want you (sexually) because of it. Babies don't remember the pain.

How painful would it be to get it then. I am happy I am circumcised, and I am glad my parents did it.	So you are happy that they chopped of the most sensitive part of your penis?

are a subset of criminals (ie not all criminals are burglars or muggers). Ripskar pointed out that gangs (criminals, but not necessarily burglars or muggers) tend to have guns. He also stated that burglars and muggers tend not to have guns.	Lemme guess, in real life you're a lawyer, correct? You must be because you're extremely hypertechnical to the point of absurdity. It doesn't matter what you call them, be it criminal or gang member of dope dealer or home invader, if somebody breaks the law then they're a criminal and it's as simple as that.Seriously dude, you're trying to get off on a technicality here. Like a lawyer trying to argue "Your honor my client isn't a prostitute, she's a female escort". Doesn't matter what you call it or what you try to pass it off as, a criminal is a criminal regardless of what their formal title is.So which is Ripskar, do criminals have guns and are likely to shoot you in the face and kill you, or do they not have guns at all. It's one or the other, it can't be both.	sarc

So they (pro-life peeps) say abortion is murder. Of course, you can only murder people. So their rule is that fetuses (feti?) are people also. But then they can't explain why fetuses aren't listed on the US Census, or why there isn't a funeral every time a woman has a miscarriage. Pretty much, along with the rules of having children, you would have to acquire the birth certificate during conception, you would have to pay taxes for children, even if you're only pregnant, etc.Or am I missing something? Care to clarify, anybody who disagrees?	Yes, you are missing something. How come age doesn't start at conception? How come when babies are born they aren't 9 months old instead of, well, seconds old.	notsarc
you can choose to have faith i whatever you want. some feel the bible represents the historical accounts of jesus. it could be mythical, magical or whatever. but, there are many who feel this is real and was produced to represent fact not fiction. you can choose to believe it or not. i don't think that the harry potter series was ever considered anything but fiction. and, i said i interpret it as i desire...not.others. yes, practices at the time condoned many of the things you state, but the bible was about jesus with many of the practices of the time added as historical color not relevant to the actual text itself.	i do not understand how sexism, slavery and filicide fit into a being that is supposed to be infinitely moral. care to justify that for me? oh wait... you can't.	sarc
Even if the number of defensive uses is only 800,000 a year, that's still a rate of more than 53 to 1 when compared to the number of homicides committed with a firearm.Kleck was a supporter of the anti-gun position. But then he decided to go and commit the ultimate sin that a liberal could: he began to think in a logical and questioning manner. If he could learn the error of his ways, why can't you?Even if the number of defensive uses is only 100,000 that's still more than 6 to 1 when compared to the number of people murdered every year.	Bad comparisons. A fair comparison would be comparing the total number of defensive gun uses to the total number of gun crimes (not just limiting it to gun homicides).	notsarc

So with that, it's also pretty easy to imagine that there was no NEED for the human genome to mutate to accommodate a fruitless/vitaminC-less diet. Likewise, we also know that primates also consume a diet high in fruits, leaves and berries, thereby getting plenty of vitamin C. So like humans, primates would have no reason for their genomes to mutate if they ate fruits and leaves high in vitamin C from the beginning.	Well yes, but thats not what DEFECTIVE GULO indicates. If one has external sources of vitamin C, GULO can mutate to be inactive without causing a problem, and once inactive the inactive gene can be inherited without causing problems so long as vitamin C intake is high enough. An inactive GULO indicates that the species has external sources of vitamin C which is essential to many metabolic processes.	notsarc

all of the british papers keep going on about how bad it is, how more people than ever are being gunned down in the streets, how guns are being imported into britain and resold through underground channels, how criminals employ young women to act as gun mules for transporting and storage, etc. now who should we believe more, your or the papers that relate the news to us?	Is that a trick question? No, the tabloid and other gutter press keep going on about how bad it is, because they sell papers by fanning fear and hatred, and fear of crime is one of their biggest markets. Yes there has been an increase in gun crime over the years, but that's largely attributable to increased attractiveness of crime in a society where social mobility has come to a standstill. In any case the number of incidents where firearms are used in crime is still very small, which is why every time someone gets shot it is headline news.   Guns are incredibly rare in this country, the only time I've seen guns in real life (other than air rifles) is on a military base.	notsarc

legislative solutions and popular appeal are not the same thing. the legislature is hired to do what's right, not what's popular. that aside, where has the gay rights movement used voting as anything except a measure of last resort? if gays knew they could count on popular support they wouldn't need to fight to get their rights protected. we know this. we also know that's there's lots of big money opposing gay rights, and sadly enough money is often the deciding factor in voting. so where is voting being used as anything other than a last ditch attempt to accomplish something for the gay rights movement?	well, you ignored the part where i said 'voting'. but imo legislative solutions are part and parcel to popular appeal because legislators are voted in on that basis. any legislator claims to 'do what's right.' so elections tend to be popularity contests. and legislators tend to want to keep their constituents happy. oh and just to make sure you understand this kronos so as not to get off in the wrong direction, this is my opinion, just like everything else i've said. it is not a lie. how is that even relevant? i never claimed it was a first resort.	notsarc

its difficult to merge life in its purest form with science, even though science's purpose is to study life.	That's not true -- actually, it doesn't make sense.

"Physics uses science to study the physical world" is true, but "science's purpose is to study life" is not true.	notsarc
True, but as Lurch corrected me before: It is the theory of evolution.	And I'm going to correct you again. The theory of evolution is by no means an extreme view. It is the prevailing view.

and neither did trebor post any evidence of his claim. why aren't you questioning him? but i suspect that trebor has asked those with better recollections of the time than he has and they have confirmed for him that what i said is true, which is why he hasn't come back and refuted my response to him. i know this info is true. i just couldn't find anything on-line that stated when isaiah was dropped from the traditional reading in american jewish temples. sorry...	two reasons: first, i come from a jewish family, and i've never heard of this before. now, i'll grant that nothing says that i should have, but this is news to me. second, and more importantly, trebor is not the person who made the positive claim; you are. it is your burden of proof. no one here can blame me for questioning your bare assertions given your history with falsehoods. so if he doesn't respond in a mere three hours, you declare victory? how about you call me presumptuous again? emoticonxrolleyes for once you acknowledge that you aren't able to back up your claim. congratulations. try it next time without accusing somebody of being cowardly and misleading.	sarc

Well, I define illness based upon the way medical professionals define illness, in which case, homosexuality is NOT an illness, and pedophilia is.Upon what criteria do you define illness?Upon what criteria do you judge them as wrong?	I think pedophilia is a disorder as opposed to an illness but I'd have to look back at some psychology books. How do I define illness? Well, I have a few contexts for this. The flu...obvious illness. Christians feel that sin is an "illness", so in that sense we are all rather ill :). As for wrong...same deal.	sarc
Ok according to the bible God only created the first two beings, Adam and Eve. Now christians dont rule out science, and science has shown that we produce offspring. God has created these offspring but not directly. Think of photosynthesis, we eat meat, this is getting energy from the sun indirectly. So we have shown that we ourselves produce offspring but we are put here and given the abbility by God to produce offspring. As far as your question on why God alows addicts to have babies it can be explained as this. We where given the freedome of choice to decide if we want to be an addict, wrong put we have the choice. God created us to have that choice, or else we would be robots. The bible also says God knows everything yet to come, so he new that this particular person would become an addict and have baby. God can stop this put he doesnt interecpt dirrectly with our choices.	So God already knows if a particular person will become an addict? That doesn't leave much free choice for that person, does it? If I go to a restaurant and God already knows I'm going to choose the poached salmon for my entree, then I don't have much choice in the matter, do I? Omniscience and free will are mutually exclusive. If God is omniscient, then we are indeed ultimately robots. Deluded with the perception of free will, but robots none the less.Unless of course, God is so omnipotent that he can know everything and still allow free choice. But then reason, logic, and thought become delusional. Sounds like a loose / loose situation to me.	notsarc

No it is not. Darwinists say that evolution happens by way of selection of random variants.....what I'm asking for is for science to make sure the variants don't arise nonrandomly. I'm looking for experiments on animals that rule out heritable, adaptive variation.	Again, nonrandom is not the same as Lamarckian. Phenotypic variation can be nonrandom because the organisms can select the most attractive/successful mates with whom to breed. Once again, you're totally stuck on one aspect of the ToE, random mutation; the ToE is much more than that.	notsarc

Since posts are disappearing anyway, let me add a new one.Now we all know that I am made in the image and likeness of God and since God is perfect, that image and likeness must also be, as a logical consequence, perfect.

So if I am the image and likeness of God, then either I am perfect or God is not.	think of it as a photocopy of a check for a million dollars. yes the copy is in the image and likeness of the original check, but it is not the check. you cannot cash the photocopy, regardless of how accurate the copy is, it is not the check, only an image of it. that doesn't mean anything is "wrong" with the original, and it doesnt mean that the copy has to have all the properties and function of the original. its just an image	notsarc

As for who plays 'word-games', it seems that you missed this... #19 "New peppered moth stuff"He went on for some time trying to undermine my posts based on the use of a word which most people have a problem with.There's also the problem with Darwin claiming a tautology was a better term than "Natural Selection", this was debated for some time, even though I posted the actual words of Darwin.The thread "Unto the Ages of Ages" developed into a debate over whether something could be both ''more accurate' and wrong, thanks Ursus!WJA and SLP argued over the word 'applied', then 'published'; whether Dembski had, and then changed this to 'proved' (see "Looking for intelligence" thread)Lurch/Ungerdunn etc over what is a 'noun'. Multiple personalities aside, this debate over 'nouns' lasted for months. He resorted to no better argument then 'you're wrong'. A great debating style!As for debating styles....Waxy enters a debate on Science/Math says that I've been refuted somewhere else, by someone else, and then leaves; does the same thing on these Creation/Evolution debates... only adds a few insults in the process... not wishing to debate, just to name call.Mach is happy to admit he doesn't read my posts/skims over them but wants to both debate and not debate them - claiming he's got a time problem... and asks me to post stuff he's already replied toWould you count as a word-game the two incidents where you've made a claim about me being insulting, and when I've asked you to point it out, you can't?One time you were so flustered you told me you were going to warn everyone about me. You make allegations then don't back them up.Archilochus makes allegations that I don't understand the word 'chance' but is un-prepared to come up with a definition, just repeats that I don't understand it. He'll go on repeating this, because it is a replacement for debate.All the while you guys are very shy when it comes to debating each other's mistakes; such as Hank describing the world as egg-shaped, etc.In short you make so many 'just-so' statements with little recourse to evidence, in an effort to drown out anyone who differs in opinion from yourself. Hence the total unwillingness to seriously tackle anyone from your own side who is eithera) wrongorb) rudeBut in short, if someone posts here a statement, and they can't even be sure what they mean by it, then it doesn't bode well. That is what has upset a number of people; when this has been pointed out. This is also why many pro-evolutionists are so quick to resort to ad hominem here. That's what this thread of yours is an attempt at - and at best it is something that suggests only other people are guilty of this crime.	No, I for one dislike your posts because I know you intentionally write irrational posts to help support your religious cause.   Just for the record montalban, basically every single legitimate scientist is "pro-evolution". Creation theory is not taught in public schools, not by chance, but because...*gasp* it's RELIGIOUS MUMBO JUMBO. There is no evidence to support it. Creation fiction has made no progress with it's "faith-based" (lackofevidence) with rational people.   And I'll also say that I'd welcome ad hominem over irrational thinking any day. Ad hominem is just a lack of patience, or someone who doesn't care to hide their emotion or opinion. Irrational thinking on the other hand is often only cured by death. Someone guilty of ad hominem can still hold a rational debate. The irrational..well, why bother?   -Mach	sarc

You should really think about what you say before you say it.

I would never use a gun on a person unless that person were a viable threat to my life, such as coming at me with a knife for example.	You need to read what people say more thoroughly, and think about it before you respond. When he said "can" (and there are not many simpler words than that!)

What I am is someone who appreciates the value of the scientific methodology, and its repeatedly demonstrated power to yield elegant, testable, useful and predictive hypotheses, including - over the past centuries - the discovery and modeling of novel forces at work in nature as well as the Theory of Evolution.	**Here you reveal exactly what I've just spoken of--you assume that science and the scientific method equates to, is synonymous with, materialism/mechanism.

Personally i don't believe in abortion. It's morally wrong and i think it's good that it's illegal.	I think often abortion is wrong but I do not agree with criminalizing it. Primarily the reasons that are used to justify criminilzation are hugely fallacious and secondarily because it won't do a thing that is positive. A woman who is determined to end her pregancy - will. Criminalization will simply make it extremely dangerous. I am responsible, have even had my tubes tied, but if I were to become pregnant and that pregnancy were the result of rape or a threat to my health or livlihood I would end it - and I will not be checking the law books first. Every woman has her line in the sand - abortion will go on regardless of its legal standing. There are a miriad of reasons seek abortion - comdemning those reasons does nothing (i.e. calling them selfish) - addressing them could help. The reasons are valid.	notsarc

the moral of that last story is: don't screw with baldy. that aside, where did god tell these folks to do what they did? just curious.	morals are what you make them to be. for example, 'it's ok to kill youths if they've insulted your prophets' is another possible one. the ones in my joshua example? he doesn't tell them, nor did i say that he told them. look at what i said: 'the morality of the old testament peoples (god included) is definitely questionable.'. however, in the next chapter he does immediately reward them, by protecting them from the angry reprisals of the neighbouring villages: '5 then they set out, and the terror of god fell upon the towns all around them so that no one pursued them.' note that in the other examples, god is either commanding it (through the proxy of a speaker) or directly doing it (pillar of salt, bears etc).	notsarc

interesting that those three are also the weakest and rarest of arguments when arguing for gun control. in fact, i have never witnessed anyone basing their entire gun control argument on the fact that 'gun owners lack the testicular fortitude to fight someone in hand-to-hand combat.'

No.      In my opinion, all arguments in favor of gun control are weak.	notsarc
So if same-sex relationships are legally recognized as "marriage," the idea of marriage as a sexually exclusive and faithful relationship will be dealt a serious XXXX.

Again, I don't think anybody will argue that owning a gun prevents crime. The reason for having a gun is as you stated - to stop the crime once it has begun (though this may prevent a worse crime from occurring).	I think some people will and have argued that. I'll work on finding a quote, but I believe it was somebody here who argued that, because of the recent SCotUS ruling, home invasion in DC would decrease because criminals would be more worried about encountering a homeowner with a gun. You do have a point about preventing a worse crime from occuring,though.	notsarc
cute, but not quite. the claim is that we want everybody to have guns. so i'd like to see some proof that gun owners have called for the repealing of the federal age limit that covers the purchase of firearms, and for the prohibited persons list that keeps felons, the insane, the drug addicted, and those that beat their wives, from legally buying guns. if those of my chosen party have made the claims that we want criminals, terrorists and the others in these categories to have guns, then i'd like to see them. otherwise the claim that we want everybody armed is nothing more than a lie. the private property of whom? we have security stops along the mexican/american border to search for drugs and other contraband. how is it not possible on the way to and from dc?	simple answer? dc has a lot less budget than the usa government. more complex answer? just looking at the commuters, there are over 400,000 people that come to work in dc every day (see link in my last post). making the preposterous assumption that they all come in at a constant flow, just looking at 400,000 of them and assuming that you would only check them coming in, that's ~4.6 people admitted per second for every second of the working week. good luck with that. good luck with convincing people that it's constitutional, as well - airports get away with it, but only because there is such a (largely unfounded) fear of death by terrorist that they can get away with something which is constitutionally shady. a quick search gave me two relevant results almost immediately.	notsarc
with regards to the cousins argument if a creature evolves into a new species wouldn't the old species not exist any more?	No, say you've got 200 of some species.

Eventually, they will be different enough so that they are no longer able to interbreed. That doesn't mean one group automatically has to die so we remain at the same number of species.Of course, one group might get some significant advantage which allows it to come back and ownzor the original area so the other group gets wiped out.	notsarc
the risk of homicide in the home is three times greater in households with guns.[3] the risk of suicide is five times greater in households with guns.[4] what's more, tragic stories of accidental or unintentional shootings from the careless storage of guns at home are all too common. the statistic noted above bears repeating: a gun in the home is 22 times more likely to be used in a criminal, unintentional, or suicide-related shooting than to be used in a self-defense shooting.

this doesnt really add up to anything more than your musings so i will take up one point. respect for your mother and father is only relevant in a society where the nuclear family is the norm. there have been some societies where this was not the norm. im afraid to say this demonstrates another example of someone that believes the world is and always was as he lives it . respect( or fear) is necessary for a functioning society but not necessarily towards parents..which is exactly what the commandment orders.	sorry your mightiness, thank you for your graciousness of addressing us common folk.  are you really that obtuse? i swear you and easy share a brain. i clearly pointed out that this commandment talks about respect for authority. personally, i think this applies to single parents, families with 2 daddies, or children raised in an orphanage.  yet i bet somehow in the formative years of the children, they are taught some form of respect for authority.  how so? i didn't write it, i'm just commenting on it. and again, i prefer to replace 'mother and father' with authority. regardless, who says respect = fear? maybe you and easy really do share a brain...you both seem to think you can define words as you see fit to lend creedence to your arguments.	sarc

It's just a term for someone who has decided to live in a way that isn't gay. They may be "gay" physiologically (whatever that means in terms of biology), but they are living in a way that doesn't give in to that--which is what matters from their religious standpoint. Many people live against urges (regarding various issues) all the time. Ironically, gay pride has itself largely to blame for the 'ex-gay' movement. I think it's an example of some gays swinging back against the 'out-and-proud' far left shift--religious gays are, in effect, saying they don't have to abide by your prescription for their lives.	And you're mentally disturbed. Didn't I say that there is no such thing as a "ex-gay"??? Did I stutter?You can pretend that denial is a river over in Egypt.

in re: the jefferson claim... it's true that he proposed castration for 'buggery.' but... considering that colonial scientists were as ignorant of sexual orientation as the ancient israelites, it's not surprising they drafted such a draconian punishment for homosexuality. jefferson's suggestion, however, was merciful by comparison. and we also know that, having revised the bible by editing out all the supernatural events (including, especially, the resurrection) and having referred to paul (author of the nt's allegedly anti-homosexual 'clobber' passages) as 'the great coryphaeus... the first corruptor of the doctrines of jesus,' that he would likely have been repelled by with archangel's views, on both god and homosexuality. in fact, it's probable, given his devotion to science and reason, that had he known then what our doctors and scientists know now about human sexuality he likely would not have gone so far as condoning so harsh an alternative as castration.	exactly who are you saying has revised the bible? and with that question asked, i believe by admitting that if it was revised to delete the meat of it, it would be equally diluted in power, content and strength.  really? if you're speaking about jefferson still, then why didn't he recommend that all punishments for homosexuality be erased from the law completely, and homosexuality be legalized at that time? that would have been the just and magnanimous thing to do if he believed such tripe as you attribute to him.	notsarc
but by that definition, either one could be viewed as impeding on religious freedom, including your view impeding on hers! we don't define imposing on religious freedom on the basis of having different ideals. it doesn't effect your religion or religious freedom if you don't get benefits under gay marriages. you can argue in other ways, on other basis, but the idea that not giving gays marriage benefits is imposing on religious freedom is an empty 'argument'.	but you have not shown how she would be harmed by equal marriage? i have shown that her definition infringes upon my religious freedom. if gay marriage becomes a reality then in no way does it infringe upon her in any way. would you care to explain how gay marriage infringes upon her in any way? it is her heterosexual privledge and her sence of entitlement that she is protecting not marriage.	notsarc

Is even 'channel' sufficiently ateleological a verb?	Yes. It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action. That is why 'selection' is always teleological. In order to select or choose anything, an end must always be in view. There must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end. The only time "channel" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. In the same way, 'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone. But 'selection' always requires volition and awareness. So 'selection' is always teleological.	notsarc
I have posted this before, but I will post it again to filter out the digressive posts of the anti-gun people... I guess they were hoping to change the subject to something they could debate, but it didn't seem to work, now did it?Statistically, tobacco kills nine times as many people as all homicides and gun accidents combined, and alcohol kills almost twice as many as die in gun-related deaths.

One other point: Say that the laws of physics (which are derived from mutual human experience) are wrong but just appear to be right and that some omnipotent being can change them whenever he likes.

Hi Lisa - I disagree with you. Babies can't be helped while trivializing and restricting mothers and not recognizing their needs. There are reasons women choose to abort and those need to be addressed and there will also be cases where women need to abort (health concerns, rape, etc.).	And the reasons have been discussed at length and most of us agree about the mother's life being endangered or possibly in cases of rape and incest.........Where we disagree with you is unecessary abortions...such as for birth control, a headache on just and inconveniencce........You think any abortion is alright...We don't.....	notsarc
Can you imagine what the U.S. population would be without abortion? Who will take care of all these children when the potential parent cannot?

because i said so! lol,... i'm so silly. i just had to post it.  seriously, i decided that i will actually construct my summary online, iangb. if you (or anyone else) cares to, you will be able to watch as i edit and construct my argument. it may be lengthy so keep it in mind that if i have to divide it up, and you post in the interim, i will have to delete this first half and move it to the end. by the way,... other than working some things out in my head,... i don't have anything prepared to post. this will be a work in progress. ... this will take quite a while. (maybe days) i see you are watching, and don't want you thinking this will be developing quickly. i will let you know when i've concluded. --chuz *** note to ian. in my attempt to compile my 'summary' i have realized that i never actually completed my arguments. it's kind of hard to summarize that which hasn't already been presented. so, my sumarization if you will- will now consists of two parts. first my arguments and then my summary.  work in progress; the argument biologically speaking, a human individual's life begins at conception definitions; a begin being biologically child conception egg embryo fetus  gamete  human individual life metamorphosisorganism sperm zygote-dictionary.com a begin being biologically child conception egg embryo fetus gamete human individual life metamorphosis organism sperm zygote-- free dictionary.com child  due process clause person --findlaw.com links logic a distinct human organism american college of pediatricians the human organism when does a human individual's life begin the physiology of aging human growth and aging wikipedia; life when does life begin? quotes; sperm; 'during fertilization, the nucleus of a sperm fuses with the nucleus of the much larger egg cell (the female reproductive cell) to form a new organism'.-the american heritage® science dictionary barack hussein obama; 'we need fathers to recognize their responsibility doesn’t just end at conception.' william jefferson clinton- 'if two cells join in the process that begins to make a human being, are they living? answer? no one disputes that. ' and 'when does the soul enter the body so that to terminate the living organism amounts to killing a person? that is the question.'	Chuz, the purpose of this summary is not to summarise your arguments as a whole - it is to summarise what your argument is up to this point.   Why not post just a summary of your position so far, as you see it - I can do the same, then you can continue with your argument?   There's no point in writing an argument, summarising it and then leaving the thread before I've had a chance to respond to even your argument (never mind your summary). If you are going to simply ignore any criticisms of your reasoning, then I struggle to see the point of you repeatedly requesting a one-on-one debate in the first place - you essentially regress your argument to the 'because I said so' that you are (presumably) hoping to avoid, it's just that there's slightly more detail.	notsarc

Anti-abortion legislation is simply a tool by which they try to maintain a less sexually permissive society, believing that if women who fall pregnant outside of marriage are forced to endure pregnancy and likely child-raising alone, rather than being offered an easy way out, they will be less likely to have sex outside of marriage.	I think you fail to take into account that for most opposers of abortion, they genuinely feel they are trying to save lives by their opposition. In many cases it's not a matter of trying control sexual prermissiveness in society but preventing lives from being killed. Disagree or not, you can't separate the anti-abortion message from the fact that it holds to the view that abortion is a form of murder.	notsarc

I have to watch for snares now? :)I didn't say it, nor does the Bible, that only males of the human race have souls.	Well, assuming that when the Bible says "you" in passages that are telling "you" to do something with your soul, I would hope that it also applies to women. But it never comes out and says "women and men have souls." This doesn't mean they don't have them.Same thing with animals. The book isn't written for non-humans, so when it says "you" we can assume it doesn't refer to non-humans. But the book never says "animals don't have souls."So we can't assume that they don't (according to the bible).	notsarc
i think a better question is what preserved their life for so long? it is the mercy of god that upholds and preserves people in this life. it is the sin of human beings that is responsible for death. this is not correct. god does go 'out of his way' to keep everyone alive. besides that, god would never be presented with any kind of problem, much less a problem of overpopulation. good grief, to suggest that the god who created the earth would have a problem with overpoulation is, frankly, as ridiculous as trying to find some passage in the bible that condones, allows, or supports any and every abortion that occurs. that is ridiculous.	ok, i understand now. all those people, including children and the fetuses of pregnant women were all sinful and god had to murder them in tsunamis, earthquakes, etc.,  is that how god deals with overpopulation? i guess that wars are part of god's plan, too, because the recent invasion of iraq wiped out more than 100,000 iraqis according to god's plan for dealing with overpopulation.	sarc

I agree, but when you know your opponent will succeed in making you look weak if you give them the chance, trying to look like the bigger man will do Jack for you.

On an internet forum why is that so important? The bigger man usually need not find it necessary to prove he is, but is secure in his knowledge he is or is big enough to realize when he isn't and adjust accordingly.My guess is this is not the only place this happens.

Ironically, when I have publicaly advanced the idea that God is generally compatable with evolution, I find that my agnostic and atheistic colleagues are generally comfortable with such ideas, but many believers are dumbfounded.	I believe that's true, and as a "believer" (creationist), here is what is hard to understand about that; In Matthew, 12:30, Jesus says "He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters". It is safe to say that both creationists and theistic evolutionists would accept that statement from Jesus, and would seek to be "with" him, while agnostic and atheists would consider themselves "not with" him. Yet theistic evolutionists are comfortable to (usually politically) be "with" agnostics and atheists, and separate themselves from creationists. If they're genuine Christians, knowing about the warnings in the Bible about false teachings, how can they be comfortable with that?Miller laments in several places throughout the book that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion, and that it shouldn't be that way - that it causes more strife between the two than should exist.	notsarc

that's information to you, not to the organism. if someone says the mountain will not get higher on it's own, and you go and dump dirt on it; you have not disproven them. by information they mean that records anything useful for the organism, including specific functions. now the average anti-evolutionist would like it to be just specific functions in which case you could just say novelty (information on how to create new systems). dna records useful data (information) for other things, it records modifications of existing systems to adapt to the environment. deletions of detrimental code is also information, although the net change is a loss. as for my previous arguments, they have been that there is no known law, physics, or calculation that would cause the construction of an novel system; leaving only probability.	that's one of the dumbest things i have ever heard. if these dummies don't have a problem with information increasing, but do have a problem with beneficial information increasing, don't you think there is a problem? you included. you don't have a problem with change, only good change bugs you. dumb!	sarc

It is entirely premature to be discussing this matter for the purpose of promoting political positions and beliefs. It is also disrespectful to those that died and their families to try and capitalize on their pain for a political agenda.

your link to not go to a definition of marriage. ot goes to a link for the word: marauder-marauder - one who, while employed in the army as a soldier, commits a larceny or robbery in the neighborhood of the camp, or while wandering away from the army. so really what was your point cause you haven't made one!!!!	if you think marriage is sacred then why are you trying to change what it is? i can't say this enough times...marriage is a word that describes a union between man and women. no one created the word marriage and then decided what it would apply to. someone saw and event and gave this event a word...this would be marriage. this 'event' has been sacred since as long as we have records to show. and now, some wish to make it sacred for themselves while destroying the sacred institute that the majority of us wish to keep.	notsarc

] How many different ways can ToE be invalidated? In a scientific theory, there are NO exceptions -- exceptions mean holes -- holes mean trouble.The answer is none so far. Your article and the mechanism involved do not impact upon TOE which makes only very broad assumptions about heritable elements. And what you reference does not constitute a hole in TOE, although it may be a new mechanism of inheritance.	yea, I often forget ToE is a mental concept, not a scientific one. Nothing -- and I mean nothing -- will ever dismantle it in the minds of the faithful. Materialism is so entrenched in your mind that even if an animal generates a new piece of morphology by mere thought, sensation or awareness, and then passes that trait down to progeny, (which has been shown on here) you still think materialism stands.

I don't think pro-choicers in general care whether or not abortion is truly rare. If they did they would put more effort into making sure it is rare, and not just legal.	I know you're talking to Jessica, so I will only comment on this. It would be easier to make it rare if pro-life people weren't intent on making it illegal. Pro-choice people have to make it as available as possible to counter pro-life attempts to shut it down entirely.If pro-life people didn't exist, then the reasonable people could work towards making abortion rare.Take the current debates for example. My entire point is that it should not be illegal. That abortion should be available as a safe and legal choice (it can only be really safe if it's legal). We spend all our time and effort debating the legality that we spend no time on creating programs to help women choose to continue their pregnancies instead of having an abortion, legal or not.	notsarc

:It probably would have been better if Scalia had said to himself when the case was brought before the court, "There certainly is no consensus about the meaning of the Second Amendment and I, as an amateur historian, am certainly not going to force my own personal views on others.

He would have loved that but pretending it hasn't been ruled as an individual right by the 82nd Congress, the DOJ in August 2004 with all the history and also by 35 Supreme Court rulings and TWO CENTURIES of lower court cases that fills a 660 pg. book with majority opinion, he is either deaf/blind or outright deceitful...I opt for the latter.He and they know full well that all the courts now are bound to consider any Second Amendment case as a civil rights issue thanks to this ruling."letting people decide" has already been done, once when the Constitution was ratified with the BOR and again when the XIVth Amendment was passed. He may as well say race issues will be decided by elected representatives the racial balance necessary in their own communities"He is completely dishonest and knows full well that this is a Republic based on the Law of the Land, The Constitution and not a democracy as he suggests.

However one thing that works against evolution is this. It is just amazing that every creature on this planet didn't evolve to use the sun as a source of energy and food in some way or another.	Almost all did. In fact, probably all that you are aware of did. Even the energy in the steak that you eat came from the sun ultimately. The thing is that evolution seems to have resulted in an organism to take advantage of almost every form of available energy. And what energy is left by "higher" animals is used by others - insects, microbes - until there is little usable energy left. That even goes so far that there are some organisms that get their energy from geothermal sources - no light involved.	notsarc

Rubbish, there are many that argue otherwise. The life of twins can be viewed as starting at the moment the zygote/ embryo splits for example.The reality though is there is no single point at which a human life begins: the moment the egg and sperm form, the moment of conception, first division and implantation, the moment the heart starts to beat, the moment of birth etc all mark stages in the formation of a new life.	oh yeahrubbish rubbish,scientifically speaking, human life (using a most bsic term) begins at conception. the twins exist as two seperate entities the moment each contains the individual human dna. seems to me you better be certain when it begins before you go around ending it. if you are driving at night an you "think" you might see a person ahead in the middle of the road you are hopefully not gonna drive over that person.

of course it is known that wild animals that are sick just die from natural selection(they get eaten, or they don't manage to find food) and even livestock, if it has some disease, can be culled to prevent outbreak of disease. in humans it is different though, there are quarantine zones to prevent spread of certain disease. however, religion is sort of disease, but mind disease which can't be prevented to spread by some quarantine, but only by some great culling, and restricting it's spreading. religion is so embedded within (weak) human mind that it can't be removed normally(e.g. non violently, as those emotional weaklings would call it) but only by eradication.	i really hope you're joking. extremism is a disease, but not religion. religion can be, and is, for the most part, peaceful.	notsarc

You claim that the distinction between a baby being a bodily function of a woman or not is a matter of “empirical fact”, this is just not so. I think you should rethink what “empirical fact” is. Empirical fact, are facts that are said to be true on the basis of empirical observation. If I see a light on in a room, that is an empirical observation, and for me, that the light is on, is an empirical fact. However, if you and I both empirically observe at a fetus in a womb then the only empirical fact we could both agree on, I think, is that there is indeed a fetus in a womb. I say that fetus is part of a persons body performing a function, you say its something else, and that's a mater if ideology, not mere observation.	So for example if I say "you are a part of my body, and therefore I have a right to kill you", is this simply a matter of ideology?I admit the distinction is not clearcut at early stages of development, but how do you support the idea that post-birth children are "a part" of their mothers' bodies and therefore legitimate to kill?It is no more legitimate to say that a fetus is a part of a woman's body than it is to say that a woman is a part of a fetus' body. Just as a woman is not a subordinate slave to the fetus within her, the fetus cannot be considered subordinate in rights to the woman it is inside.	notsarc

That reminds me of the discussion I got into on a "christian" board when I referred to a particular pompous XXX as a pompous XXX. I was banned for a week for using profane language. Pointing out that an XXX is an animal and that my remark made sense only in that light was fruitless. My answer was to demand that they ban some versions of the Bible because they told of how Abraham tied his XXX to a tree and Jesus sat on his XXX in Jerusalem. Didn't phase them.

Evolutionists have taught for decades that the second law of thermodynamics—the entropy principle that things naturally decrease in complexity rather than increase—poses no barrier to evolution. Their claim is that while there is an overall downhill trend in nature, uphill innovations can occur locally in a system if abundant energy is available. Specifically the sun's energy provides all that is necessary to transform inorganic chemicals into a living cell and eventually into people. All that is necessary is an open system and abundant energy, especially the sun's energy. If complicated living organisms can be created in this way, certainly something not nearly so complicated as a house could be produced. Especially a solar-powered house!	That's obviously not what is said. The sun's energy is not claimed to be a mechanism that makes order of disorder. What it does do is override the tendancy within the 2LoTD where total usable energy in a system decreases.	notsarc
Then banning same-sex marrige would be wrong, and there would be no reason for it. Unless it harms someone, a law should never be passed.	A law baning same-sex marriage, then I'd agree.

so it’s the scientific community that sets up communication within a society, and then the dumb old common peasants come along and screw it all up? hahaha – sorry but i’m not convinced.  i’m not “in” science, other than unwillingly contributing my tax dollars – however small the percentage is – to a social agenda of those who control the scientific community. i’m permitted to have “theories” about it. emoticonxangel when the word “theory” is applied to a very wide range of subjects, it’s not fair to label someone who questions one theory a rejecter of all theories. that’s what the link in the opening post did – that’s not rational discourse, it’s not secular open inquiry, it’s not a search for truth or knowledge. it’s political/atheist rhetoric - look at the bottom of the page and whose name do we see? richard dawkins, what a surprise. and a quick google of “edgar pearlstein” shows a sarah palin hating atheist liberal just like him. emoticonxrolleyes science has a role in the control of the people atheists do, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that they represent science. you haven’t gotten in over your head – most who post here don’t know much about science. tq doesn’t, and of course he’ll tell you that i don’t. there’s a big difference between science, and the creation/ evolution controversy. many atheists who seem to be interested in science are actually only interested in it to the point that it helps them feel “intellectually fulfilled”, to discredit religion. some of the best reading on the creation/evolution controversy isn’t written by scientists, but by philosophers who have done just enough scientific homework on the subject to keep a clear focus on the controversy, without confusing it with too much detail. michael ruse and bradley monten are two excellent atheist authors on the subject. religious authors, practically too many to name. william dembski, david berlinski, phillip johnson, cornelius hunter, many others. you would do well to read anything by any of these people. far too many young people seem to make the mistake of getting most all of their information from rabid atheists who are also degreed biologists, like richard dawkins. he’s become a celebrity, and most degreed biologists who are not rabid atheists are a little to timid to take him on in a very direct way, without fear of discrimination, academic or otherwise. michael behe is one of the few who has been somewhat successful at it, not in avoiding discrimination, but in his ability to make a comfortable living in spite of it. read “the edge of evolution”, or “darwin’s black box” sometime. :) some irreducible complex structures, but not all of them. for atheists, that’s good enough. but it’s not good enough for everyone. in behe’s words; “…as biochemists have begun to examine apparently simple structures like cilia and flagella, they have discovered staggering complexity, with dozens or even hundreds of precisely tailored parts. …as the number of required parts increases, the difficulty of gradually putting the system together skyrockets, and the likelihood of indirect scenarios plummets.” behe wrote this in 1996, and since then it has only gotten worse for the atheists, no matter how much they dance.	When it comes to all the examples that Behe had provided in both his first book, and his second book , it has been shown to be able to evolve naturally.   That means, in principle, IC systems can evolve. If you don't believe so, bring forth the I.C. system of your choice.   To say 'But you don't know all the answers' is just the logical fallacy known as 'argument from ignorance'.   Behe brings a system up that he claims is IC.. the pathway for evolution is discovered, and Behe trys another one. How dishonest can you get?   The concept is falsified.	notsarc
NO!What we need to do is out terrorize the terrorists!Using a plethora of dispicable methods born out of the heart of madness, I'm sure we could show the world that we're number 1 in anything we set our hearts to.Why, I'd speculate that such a campaign would quickly see Osama handed over on a silver platter in short notice.Now, some might say that such would only increase opposition to the US...but, when you consider that the heads of all military aged males adorn poles leading from Kabul to Baghdad (think about it)...I'd doubt there'd be many left to take up arms.

In the following example that you provided: What is the context of the word 'truncated'? The way I read it - it is talking about a truncated string of code or something. What was truncated?... *more than 100 LPL gene mutations have been identified, the majority of which cause loss of enzymatic function. In contrast to this, the naturally occurring LPLS447X variant is associated with increased lipolytic function and an anti-atherogenic lipid profile and can therefore be regarded as a gain-of-function mutation. This notion combined with the facts that 20% of the general population carries this prematurely truncated LPL...*	The original molecule had some lipolytic function, but removing some amino acids from it, in the right place, made it fit better into the substrate, and thereby greatly increased its functionality. Barbarian observes:We thought it would take roughly a million years for bacteria to evolve enzymes capable of digesting nylon (because the compound is so different than any they were able to digest) but it took less than a century. .	notsarc

so are you are saying that because she wants an abortion she should have it? then why are you even against abortion? we are talking about a life here not just a fetus. i believe that everyone has a right to live. no fetus should pay the consequences because of a decision made by it's mother. in the year 2000, there were 1.3 million fetus that were killed and the same amount of families were waiting for children to adopt. if you are saying that nothing is wrong if a woman needs an abortion, the you are saying she can have repeat abortions. what if a woman who has unprotected sex and knows the consequences of her actions but later decides she wants an abortion? what is your opinion on that?	i think so too. every father should have a right to have a say when it comes to an abortion because that fetus was formed from their chromosomes and genetics. i am surprised that advocates for abortion are saying that men have no right to tell a woman how to control her body but yet they don't have a problem with the decision of the u.s supreme court in which all of the judges were men.	notsarc

I'm still having a hard time with this. If nothing exists, no matter, then how can "the number one" exist? On what basis is it defined? If there is only nothing, then you can't add to it, like I said 0+0=0.I know this is getting slightly off topic and philosophical, but it would seem to me that "concepts", and I'm not sure exactly how that's being defined, must have a basis in reality, and therefore in matter.I agree in that they are not created. I disagree in that IMHO, they are a function of our physical universe. IMHO, you don't have the concept without the universe to "define" it. I don't know, it's too early in the AM, maybe someone can point out the errors in my thinking.Waxy	addition works in the intangible as well. 1 minute + 1 minute = 2 minutes. 1 idea + 1 idea = 2 ideas. the concept of quantity is not limited to matter. if there was just a vaccous void were absolutely nothing was happening, then there would be no application of logic. but even that in itself would be logical. nothing + nothing = nothing is logical. it would actually be logical if a void with nothing added to it result in something. so even in a void, logic still prevails	notsarc
5) Moving on, if we look teh other way, evolution is actually a theory not physically proven, one of it s theory suggested that human started out in Africa while another in Asia, but if u look at them none resembles the other and none have a characteristic of an animal.	And of course, the theory of gravity isn't "physically" proven either. Neither is the heliocentric theory or atomic theory or the germ theory of disease. However, evolution has been observed to occur and the current theories are the best explanations that we have for the observations. As far as your mangling of the "Out of Africa" theory, it would be nice if you actually learned what you are talking about before you babble such nonsense.	sarc

So why, in this gun-hater's dream come true of congress, did they choose not to advance a single gun control bill and have it signed into law?	I don't find it surprising. It's probably a strategic sacrifice on their part rather than a change in their personal views . They don't want to lose votes and possible support from gun owners for their priorities like health care reform because of a difference of opinion on gun control policy. They know that the Republicans are going to hit them with everything they've got during election time and exaggerated accusations about the Democrats wanting to take away people's guns would hurt them. The Republicans learned during the Clinton years that creating as much as paranoia as possible about the Democrats supporting big government is the way to regain a majority in Congress.

Some Iowa county recorders say they have contemplated refusing to give a marriage license to gay couples who walk into the office, but so far none is vowing to do so.“This is putting us in a very, very difficult position here,” Wayne County Recorder Angela Horton said Thursday in an interview. “But sometimes you have to put aside your personal beliefs, your religious beliefs, when you're doing a job you've sworn under oath to provide.”After hearing rumblings of discontent, a state official sent a strongly worded note to all recorders Thursday explaining why they should obey the Iowa Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage when it takes effect April 27.Victoria Hutton of the Iowa Department of Public Health informed recorders that the ruling has the force of law statewide: “All county recorders in the state of Iowa are required to comply with the Varnum decision … and to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples in the same manner as licenses issued to opposite gender applicants.”Republican state senators on Thursday crafted a new proposal that would give recorders an out if their religion is opposed to gay marriage, but Senate Democratic Leader Mike Gronstal scorned it as “blatantly unconstitutional.”State to counties: Obey gay marriage ruling, issue certificates | DesMoinesRegister.com | The Des Moines RegisterWhy is it that people of religion keep trying to seek special privilege for their religious beliefs?Do your job, or get out of the office.Why is it any more special for a "Christian" to have a "religious" belief against homosexuality, as opposed to a NON-Christian having a "non-religious" belief against homosexuality???

You'll have to specify which argument. My response was to your question "Can religious views be logical?"	I posted two versions:1. I am a rational being. Is it logical to assume that a rational entity formed me? (not my parents--on a mankind scale) Is it more logical than to assume that I generated out of inanimate matter incapable of logic? Generated due to "miraculous" odds? I'm not sure what the numbers are. I think the logical sequence is a belief in a higher power rather than a springboard to logic from a primordial soup of nothing.2. I came up with a belief in the supernatural via natural logic--I am a rational being. I could not have therefore come from irrational combinations of inanimate matter that somehow combined to form rational animate matter. I came from a rational source.	notsarc
You're wasting your time Phyllis, these spiritually dead empty suits are just too shallow to appreciate the value of a life they can't communicate with verbally. How pathetic they are not to appreciate that with all of the value and potential they see in themselves, that at one time they were exactly like these unborn children with the same mental existence they now claim is justification for their extermination.	There is the potential for a human that comes out of many, crude and vulgar things. Some end up on a maxi pad or when a guy reaches for the box of Kleenex. Should I feel a special bond with the conceptions rudely flushed out because they couldn't make it to the uterine wall? They had the potential, the DNA, were once a life too, and made a valiant effort. Life is constantly in motion. We don't value all life, or maybe not all life the same. When it appears to have some aspects of human personhood, this would seem like a logical marker, where we'd place greater value.	sarc

Most evolutionists believe that matter and time were created by a "Big Bang."	But recognition of the big bang as a very good explanation of cosmology isn't limited to evolutionsits. In fact, most other scientists also believe so, most especially cosmologists and astrophysicists, who are directly concerned with the early universe. Evolutionists, even though the origin of matter and time are irrelevant to the study of evolution, are also educated in science and probably accept the work done by these other scientists.	notsarc

Cappy: How sad that you are unable to get this through your twisted brain. The woman with the help of a man, determined a pregnancy. The natural course of any pregnancy is 40 weeks of gestation then live birth. That is the NORMAL, NATURAL course. A woman wanting to end that pregnancy at any point of the gestational period is going against the normal course of nature. The government, in such cases, in the interest of the continuation of the human species, should be able to assist these pregnancies through to live births and make adoptions easier, NOT enable murder.	Ok, so if we are going to let everything take the "normal course of nature", then lets just let everyone die. Have cancer? Too bad, its the natural course of nature that you die.

I would disagree here about this, in terms of the pro-life view. It's not that mental existence is irrelevant ... quite the contrary; in fact it's the reality that there will SOON be mental existence that makes it matter. I don't think the issue of abortion should ever be divorced from the reality that the embryo will likely grow into a human being ... a human that is human by pretty much anyone's standards. So I suspect that the big difference here is that pro-choicers are more "in the moment" in terms of the way they view the fetus, and pro-lifers are more "long-term bigger-picture" in terms of the way they view the fetus. Certainly the likely potential of what the fetus grows into has a lot to do with the pro-life position on whether it is truly human.	But growth is fairly irrelevant. My sperm can grow into a human too, and have mental existence, yet ejaculating isn't murder. It just becomes a huge debate on where to draw the line, therefore it is best to focus on the state that it is right NOW. Not what it was or could possibly be.That seems reasonable to me.[/QUOTE]	notsarc

Without question my largest beef with God would have to be the fact that according to the Bible you need to believe in God in some fashion or another in order to make it into heaven. The reason this is my beef with him is because it is much more difficult to believe in him when you are born in India than if you are born in the US or Europe. The Indian culture is that of Hinduism and a mix of other religions unlike that of the US and Europe which is primarily Christian. That means being born in the US or Europe gives you a better chance of making it to heaven as you are more likely to end up being a Christian and believing in God. Would the be at all fair if this were the case? My answer is plainly and simply no! It is idiotic infact. If God existed and he was perfect then almost without a doubt he would have to base getting into heaven on the actions of a person instead of the beliefs of a person to be fair. His system would not be at all perfect if being born in one place means you get into heaven while being born in another place means you don't get into heaven. Furthermore this means that he needs to take into consideration other influences on your life including whether or not your parents or community were proper places to grow up and whether or not you were ever given the proper situation in which to change your life to God's expectations. If not given any opportunities or given very few and still turning out to be a decent person should be better than if you turned out to be a decent person and were given many opportunities to end up this way. God in all his perfection would need a very complicated system to judge who gets into heaven in order for it to be fair but I just don't see spelled out in the Bible.	Why would anyone want to get to Heaven? Archangel and people like him would be there, praying and chanting 24/7 . Thanks but no thanks!	sarc

Is this the sort of thing that is being taught at that bastion of liberal science, MIT? How can this be presented as fact rather than theory?New and improved nuclear fuel createdNuclear fission, neutrons and protons, and even the atom itself are just theories. No one has ever seen an atom or a neutron. No one has ever observed an atom split. Why are our liberal news media allowed to present this as fact?Moreover, aren't nuclear reactors designed by intelligent humans? I also notice that this research was funded by our hard earned tax dollars without requiring that the benevolence of God also be researched in equal time.

Not really. That's the fallacy of exclusion of the middle. Because there are only two choices, if one is wrong somehow, the other is therefore correct.

'prostitution is not a victimless crime as there are child prostitutes, and the human trafficking among other things.' the reason human trafficking if prevelent in prostitution is exactly because it is illegal. if you legalised prostitution, supply of (and demand for) native prostitutes will rise dramatically. do you not see that trafficking and child prostitution would actually be lowered by legalising prostitution? 'legalization of prostitution would lead only to ... a further spread of hiv/aids.' again, do you not see how there would actually be a reduction in sexually transmitted viruses if prostitution were regulated and legalised? the majority of problems with prostitution are directly attributed to their illegal status.	oh really xaeon? netherlands has had prostitution legal for years and they are one of the most primary destinations for humans being trafficked. europe has many countries who have legalized prostitution but suffer from increased human trafficking. but maybe the us is different?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prostitution_in_the_netherlands  with it legalised more people are having sex with whores, and as soon as a whore is infected she doesn't even know it yet, so if she gets infected with hiv she still has sex with customers up until the day her next 'check up' is which is usually once a week. what happens to the infected prostitute? she gets kicked out onto the street. so thats one more woman infected, and possible many more men.	notsarc

A furcula has been identified in some theropods, but it is rather rare and then only imprefectly preserved. An indication that it may be mostly connective tissue. Archaeopteryx has a furcula. But even at that it doesn't compare to the same structure in birds. It is intermediate. Imagine that!	notsarc
she believes she can treat cops like she did and doesn't really care what reaction they have because she will use it as an excuse to sue them.	It's not about how she treated cops. It's about how cops treated her as an American citizen with rights.	notsarc
OK, take the quotation marks off the word insignificant and answer the question.	I didn't think you had either the intellectual or logical ability to respond. :)	sarc
this outta be good. a creationist actively making himself look like a complete idiot. normally we have to pay for kind of entertainment.  besides, even if he somehow manages to prove that ridiculous claim, that doesn't actually prove god. like i said, normally we have to pay for kind of entertainment.	whoa! duo. give the kid a chance. it seems that you are skeptical that he can offer empirical 'proof' that his god exists. certainly, since he is a 'philosophy and theology' major he must understand the implications of 'proof' in the context of science, as well as the meaning of the term 'empirical'. after all, wouldn't those ideas be something that a philosopher would be expected to understand? so let's await his 'empirical proof' without laughter. wait until he presents his 'empirical proof' before we laugh.	sarc
and that truth can be demonstrated objectively so that all can accept it. something true for some but not others is not true in the true sense of the word.	actually, quite correct. i am surprised. i woudl have thought you more of the relativistic type.	notsarc
the us and turkey struck a deal saying that the us could use turkey airstrips as a staging point if turkey could move into the northern section of iraq. the same northern section which is 80% kurds. the us has essentially handed over thousands of kurdish lives to turkish slaughter. i thought we were 'the shining beacon of life'?	where did you get this from? i want to read it.	notsarc
You throw these insults around like you know what your saying. You are really one of the the most self-deluted zealots I've run across. Keep up the good christer work ArchEvil! You're doing a smash-up job convertin' us heathn's. emoticonXAgree	I can't convert you JSD, only Christ can. But you must be open to Him and His Spirit for that to happen so don't be looking to me to save you. And you may think I'm self deluted, as in somehow watered down, but you are self deluded as in completely entrenched in your bigotry and ignorance of what is right and true. But thanks for judging me. I welcome it. :p	sarc
... here is what is hard to understand about that; In Matthew, 12:30, Jesus says "He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters".	But Miller is with Jesus (and by extension, you): he says that God exists and that Christianity is true. Or, if you insist that he's against you, you're left with this conundrum: You call Miller and theistic evolutionists incorrect, and he calls you and anti-evolutionists incorrect; why is your position any more logical than his?Regarding your citation about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts, you omit the remainder of the paragraph. Shame on you, marc, for your quote mine. Miller clearly continues with "philosophical pronouncements" that many atheists do not forward. Over the following three paragraphs, he examines a single philosophical insinuation -- not a plethora of them -- and then moves beyond "atheistic philosophical pronouncements."	notsarc
c) Why do these creatures have the right to live at the time you give for question b.	Because that's when the law says that they have the 'right to live.' Rights are legal terms that are fabricated by humans. They are not constant, but rather change whenever we wish to change them.	notsarc
He probably doesn't make a distinction in that. He will count drinking and gun owning as doing both at the same time, kinda like winnie the mute did.	Yeah guess that probably makes me a gun-toten redneck drunk,shooten everything in sight huh.emoticonXKillemoticonXGood	sarc
You seem to think that child services only did this investigation this week. This was an investigation conducted in Feb, and the police and DA office would certainly have access to the report. The fact that they executed warrants and arrested wacko says that perhaps they have more to their case than this investigation. And also, keep in mind, that the "investigation" was done by private investigators hired by wacko, not by the police and DA's office.	I did not say that I thought that, that would be putting words in my mouth. Sure they'd have access to the report... Sneddon probably had his grubby hands on it ASAP. So what if the investigation was done by private investigators? If Sneddon did it, he would plant evidence... he probably did that when they searched MJ's house. Oops I mean... the government NEVER lies. emoticonXWow	sarc
There's no comparing gays to murderers in anything I wrote, Kronus. That's your creation and attempt to belittle. The discussion was on TOLERANCE AND INTOLERANCE. The quote I was responding to was: "It is perfectly acceptable to be intolerant of intolerance." Get the drift now?	Yup, I get the drift. You're the sort that is in denial about how he feels about gays; equating tolerance for gays with tolerance for murderers, while pretending you're doing something else. Now I know how you think, thanks!	sarc
In affirming the absolute sanctity of life, we deny the sanctity of particular lives by putting them at the disposal of others - in the case of abortion, affirming the absolute sanctity of the baby's life involuntarily subordinates the mother to the child.	This is not true. Rather, when there is conflict between one's sanctity of life vs another's quality of life, the sanctity of life must win.	notsarc
SCHUMER: OK. Now, let me ask you this. When you wrote that statement, you did not -- as we discussed yesterday -- when you wrote that the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion, you had no exceptions. So that would mean, at least in 1985, your view then, there would be no constitutional protection for a woman to terminate her pregnancy even if the termination was needed to preserve her future ability to have children, right?ALITO: Senator, it was a general statement that didn't go into -- it didn't...SCHUMER: But it had no exceptions. You didn't make that...ALITO: It was one sentence, and it certainly didn't represent...SCHUMER: There was no -- you didn't write any exception for that situation. Correct? It just said the Constitution does not protect. It was without exception. And, yesterday, you didn't argue me when I mentioned that without exception.ALITO: I don't recall your using the words without exception. SCHUMER: I think I did.(CROSSTALK)SCHUMER: If you believe...ALITO: Could I just answer that question? It's one sentence and it certainly is not an attempt to set out a comprehensive view of the subject.SCHUMER: No, I understand that. But it was a very strong statement. It didn't talk about any exceptions at all. And the way I read that statement, even if a woman was raped by her father, she'd have no constitutional protection to have an abortion and terminate that pregnancy. If you believe the Constitution protects no right to an abortion that would follow, wouldn't it?ALITO: I think the statement speaks for itself, and it's one sentence and it's not an effort to set out a comprehensive view of...SCHUMER: Knowing these examples, do you still refuse to distance yourself in any way from a broad, unqualified statement, without exception, that the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion? No ands, ifs or buts, is my words.ALITO: What I actually said was that I was proud of my participation in the Thornburg case in which the government made the argument that it made in the Thornburg case...SCHUMER: But you said in the previous sentence to that statement that you personally held those views.ALITO: That's correct. But what I was talking about there was the Thornburg case and nothing more than the Thornburg case.SCHUMER: I understand. But you haven't rethought the position at all, even knowing these extreme cases and the hardship that it might cause?ALITO: Well, what you have pointed out is exactly why, if the issue were to come up, and one were to get beyond stare decisis, the whole judicial decision-making process would have to be gone through.SCHUMER: You didn't think that through in 1985?ALITO: I was not involved in...SCHUMER: When you wrote the statement. When you wrote that statement.ALITO: And when I wrote the statement what I was saying was that I was proud of what I had done in relation to the Thornburg case, which was to write the memo that the committee is aware of, which did not argue that Roe should be overruled, did not argue that the government should argue that Roe should be overruled, but that the decision should be challenged on other grounds that were quite similar.SCHUMER: I understand what you wrote, but you also -- we can bring the statement up here, but I don't want to go over the thing of yesterday. I would just ask you to think of all the consequences of a broad statement, even from 1985, that the Constitution does not protect the right to abortions. Not an exception of health of the mother, not an exception of rape or incest, not an exception of any of these others. I didn't see any of those in your job application. But I want to conclude on...ALITO: Senator...SCHUMER: Go ahead, please.ALITO: It was one sentence. And I think what you're saying highlights the importance of not addressing this until the judicial process takes place where all of this complexity would be taken into account.SCHUMER: In all due respect, sir, I think it highlights the importance of an obligation to discuss it, particularly in light of a strong statement before.But we'll have to differ on that.	Schumer is a bonafide idiot, as are many in the Senate. He failingly tried to draw Alito into exposing how he would rule on abortion if presented a case. Alito is far too intelligent to be logically trapped by a buffoon such as Shumer.It is also plain to see he interrupts when he supposes the response will indeed make sense against his flailings.	notsarc
Karl,Thanks for offering to teach me. I do have many questions. The sun is shrinking. If one does the math backwards on it, the Earth cannot be as old as evolutionists claim it to be, can it? It would burn up.	The short answer is that it isn't. See the details here: Phil Plait	notsarc
in other words youre happier because the old man did something criminal and broke the law. admit it.	so the old man was doing something criminal by carrying a firearm for self defence? the bar***d! how can you do such a thing, breaking the law like that, or maybe if the criminal who beat him up was the one who actually deserved to be charged, or better shot. so you think that this man who was following the law (texas case) deserved to go to jail for defending his property and anybody else who may have been hurt, killed as a result of their next crime? are you actually insane? have you lost your marbles? what is wrong with you?	sarc
(Playing devil's advocate)And, by what authority would you deny a woman's "right to choose" an abortion that happens to be "late in her pregnancy?"	Thats a very good question. To be honest - I would prefer no legislation period - but I would not get up in arms about a late term restriction like I described because 1) a fetus could very well survive outside of the mom at that point, 2) most reputable doctors won't conduct an abortion at that stage without a legitimate medical reason anyway.	notsarc
ooo, you had your gut cut open??  what a pity. i think you could have avoided alot of suffering if you had just used a condom. if you don't want another mouth to feed then just take birth control or use a condom.  why shouldn't fetuses have rights? once they're a fetus, then eliminating them is technically killing them. and at nine months, they're no longer dependent on it's mother's blood, and therefore is technically a baby. at nine months, you're not killing a fetus, you're killing a baby.	why do you assume the poster didn't use birth control? they said nothing about birth control; only a statement on being pregnant and having an abortion. also, why do you make any assumptions about suffering? according to the poster, suffering was avoided. condoms are not 100% effective. a childhood friend's younger sibling was the product of a failed condom, among other factors. nine months and nine weeks are completely different.	notsarc

That is between them and God.

And for decades, evolutionist fools proclaimed they had decoded the Book of Life….they said that individual genes controlled individual traits. Well all that came to a crashing halt when the Human Genome Project showed that the one-gene/one-phenotype concept was indeed a fairytale. Instead, to the shock and dismay of teary-eyed evolutionists, they found that the human genome only has about 25,000 genes – over 100,000 short of their estimate. This meant their theory about how they thought life worked had to be scrapped.	So a theory was revised... does that mean that it was wrong afterwards?	notsarc
Chuz, the purpose of this summary is not to summarise your arguments as a whole - it is to summarise what your argument is up to this point. Why not post just a summary of your position so far, as you see it - I can do the same, then you can continue with your argument?There's no point in writing an argument, summarising it and then leaving the thread before I've had a chance to respond to even your argument (never mind your summary). If you are going to simply ignore any criticisms of your reasoning, then I struggle to see the point of you repeatedly requesting a one-on-one debate in the first place - you essentially regress your argument to the 'because I said so' that you are (presumably) hoping to avoid, it's just that there's slightly more detail.	I see your point, Iangb but I'm not about to be leaving before you've had a chance to respond. I won't be "leaving" at all. You challenged me to produce an argument, so I'm going to produce my argument. I will then summarize the argument, and you can respond to it and we can then discuss / debate those specifics that you have a problem with.Truthfully, this is how I should have first responded to your challenge. Doing it piece meal has only resulted in a less focused debate.--Chuz	notsarc
yet you have no idea what kind of marriage bill and hillary have. they could have and open marriage, or a swingers understanding. bill gets to have his way with all the women he wants too and so does hillary.	there is plenty of evidence on what kind of marriage the clintons have. i am not making this up out of whole cloth, i am referring to the jr. senator's own words in her memoir 'living history': hillary rodham clinton felt 'dumbfounded, heartbroken and outraged' when she learned of the affair and said that she could 'hardly breathe' when she learned the rumors of the affair were true. 'gulping for air, i started crying and yelling at him: 'what do you mean? why did you lie to me?' mrs clinton writes.  doesn't sound like such a swingin good time ey what? but don't take my word for it, go down to the library and read pg 502.  i stand by my previous thesis.	notsarc
lmao! did you read my last sentence, the conclusion of my post? and i quote: "so to answer your question: yes" damn im so evasive! since you asked the question again, ill answer again <snip>stuff about us being in a democratic system</snip> as a christian, if a legal matter is being contested, and you want to oppose it, you are certainly welcome to do so. as a gay, if you want to propose a legal matter, a christian should be equally welcome to contest it. it is doing unto others as they would have others do unto them, so to answer your question: yes	Was that so hard? Anti gay Christians do want gays to oppose their, marriages, discriminate against them, oppose christians from being able to adopt, and practice thier religion. Since anti gay christians are doing all these things to gay people then that is how they want gay people to treat christians.	sarc
You are making a mockery of the 2nd Amendment. You know the answer.	I am not making a mockery of the second ammendment (and so what if I am. Isn't free speech on the first ammendment?). I am actually asking a legitimate question and have yet to have it answered. WHERE DO WE DRAW THE LINE? The second ammendment sheds no light on this. If I was mocking anything it was that you were dodging the question because you want to say no limits although in face of something so obvious you are embarrassed at such a statement.	sarc
see for yourselves. the fact remains that in the caribbean, the small towns and the pre-invasion african countries, poverty and crime was near nil. yes criminals existed, but not in the rampant way we see today. and yes people had no money, but everyone was self-sufficient and contented with the standard of life. there were no huge social gaps like there are today.	Are you kidding me?! You think that blacks living in Third World Carribean and African countries are "content?!" They're starving by the tens of thousands per day or living so far below the poverty level that it's unimaginable. Maybe you should wander off the beach sometime and see for yourself.	sarc
my biggest problem with the gay rights issue is their tireless and often deceptive efforts to drag science into the whole thing. we know that there is nothing that ties biology and genes into sexual orientation, yet the gay society insists that there is, supporting shabby studies with inconclusive results and publishing them as facts. i have absolutely no problem with the gay lifestyle, marriage rights or social place. but when it must be done under the guise of false science, there is a problem from what ive seen, homosexuality, and sexuality on a whole, is indeed a complex issue. it is misunderstood, and many 'authorities' on the subject submit conflicting reports, making the issue even more complicated. not only that, but people guard their sexuality with strong emotions, and therefore tend to believe what they want to believe about it. it makes finding the truth 10 times more difficult.	we do? how do we know that? i will agree that there is not yet proof to make such a link, but i am unaware of proof that there is no link. did i miss something?	notsarc
