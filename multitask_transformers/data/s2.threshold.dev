Not at all . Your answers were without content or meaning . There was no sarcasm . You snipped most of my remarks because you were unable to address them . You have no answers and have been reduced to insult . That means that you have lost the discussion and you know you have lost . Otherwise you would attempt meaningful answers . You have made yourself a fool with nothing but names and insults .
Actually , you said :
Actually , the debate on this one was hard to miss 8 or 9 years ago . John Woodmorappe , in his book , Noah 's Ark : A Feasibility Study , Inst for Creation Research ( July 1 , 1996 ) , 298 pp. , ISBN : 0932766412 did exactly that . Essentially Woodmorappe equated `` kinds '' to genus in most cases , with an occasional family that contained an inordinate number of genera thrown in where he could n't make all of them fit . Woody came up with 15,754 `` kinds '' , and calculates that there would have been enough room on the ark for all of them . He also calculated the room requirements based on the median size of the animals rather than the average size . Of course , he leaves off all plants , arthropods , mollusks , fish , and aquatic mammals . I do n't recall if he included the dinosaurs , but Ken Ham , Kent Hovind , Carl Baugh and the like have them on the ark . You correctly assume that the creationist story would be that there was a `` dog king '' and a `` cat kind '' from which all species evolved in a few years after the flood . Never mind that a single pair of cats could not possibly carry enough genetic diversity to evolve all 36 species of cat in 4 genera , not even in the 4,500 years since the flood was claimed to have occurred . In order to cram all the `` kinds '' on the ark , creationists must leave off everything but mammals and birds ( without ever explaining how they could have survived a flood that lasted a year ) , and then propose hyper-evolution at rates that make evolutionary biologists dizzy , calling it `` variation in kind . '' It should also be noted that `` John Woodmorappe '' is a pen name of Jan Peczkis , a science teacher from Chicago with a degree in earth science . Besides his young earth creationist articles as Woodmorappe , Peczkis has also published old earth articles in peer reviewed literature . At one time Peczkis threatened to sue several people on the internet who revealed the duplicity ( one being Joe Meert of the University of Florida geology department . Radiometric Dating , Paleosols and the Geologic Column ) . If he consulted a lawyer , I 'm sure that he was laughed out of the office , since you ca n't sue someone for slander if what they say is true . A review of Woodmorappe 's book and other interesting links can be found at Talk Origins . You can buy the book at amazon.com for $ 44.50 .
You have some good points here , but what do you do in the event of pregnancy due to rape ? Or a pregnancy that is going to put the life of the mother at risk ? And to push the line a bit further , what about failed contraception , where the 'morning after ' pill is taken ? Does that count as abortion as it happens after conception ? Smiley
Just another one of Chuzlife 's overgeneralizing personal attacks . Along with child molester , mass murderer , ad nauseum ... Chuzlife may not need God , but he needs the good guys and the bad guys in his worldview .
I think I 'm going to start a `` Hope After Propoganda '' site after reading that . But really where the agony comes is when women go through with an unwanted pregnancy . Abortions usually solve a lot of women 's problems , and most women never regret it .
Why not tell us in your own words , since you have made such claims ? If all of your sources agree with you , then they are not relevant to the debate . Let 's assume ever source you name agrees with your point of view , and from there , you can answer the questions . -Mach

Aside from the obvious logical fallacy , if alien life were precious ( which it is n't ) and assuming we ignore the chestburster since that does n't happen in a pregnancy then I 'd say you ca n't remove it .
This seems to be the central argument : the article continues to give many examples of moral disapproval of neglecting or murdering your children . However , it ignores the fact that parenthood is a relationship which is not defined simplistically by genetic relation or by being in the womb ( it is unclear if he thinks surrogate mothers should be able to have abortions ) . We can be prosecuted for neglecting an adopted child or step-child , or anyone we have parental responsibility for . On the other hand , if a person gives their child up for adoption then they can not be charged with negligence if the child is deserted by its new parents . One interesting part :
On the contrary , there is no evidence to suggest that we have not evolved via common descent . Not in any living creature thus far examined , or any fossil thus far unearthed . We are obliged to seek out evolutionary mechanisms precisely because the fact that it has happened is beyond all doubt .
You can try and deny the facts all you like . Here they are from the CDC for 2003 , go spin them .

I am so sorry to hear about what has happened to you . I hope you get away from this terrible man and surround yourself with people who love you . I must ask , though , why are you a Christian ? You completely disagree with typical Christian sentiments on abortion , you feel none of the purported guilt the religious movement implies is inevitable , you feel like you did the right thing , so why would you continue to profess to belong to this religion if you disagree with one of the major issues of the day ?
And that ( among a number of other reasons ) is why I will probably never , ever live in the state of California . Personally I have no desire to live somewhere that wo n't let me take the means to adequately defend my family and myself , if necessary .
It 's posted here in another thread at http : //www.youdebate.com/vBulletin/s ... 5 & amp ; pagenumber=3 The car/gun analogy keeps being brought up .

Yep , homosexuals join to practice a religion that hates them just so they can gain access to children . I mean , so much for joining any of those adult dating services ... I suppose becoming a priest is much easier . When will Christians such as yourself learn to stop spinning the story for your own hate agenda upon gays ? Have you ever heard of accountability ?
But how can we make rules without legal lines in sand ? At least its better than an illegal line .
I thought it was on topic actually , if emotive . Well , it responds to the topic title , Ethmi re-refined the topic to just 'prove guns increase aggression ' a few posts in . Or are you saying that a child with a gun is just as likely to kill someone as a child without a gun ?
I know at least one person from the Netherlands who owns a pistol . Are you sure that it is ENTIRELY illegal to own a firearm , or is it possible to obtain a permit for one ? Also , the whole `` school shooting '' business in the US is not really any sort of major problem . The thing is , the media reports every single incident making it seem more common than it really is . As far as uses for a gun : In the US lots of people live in rural areas where it could take police about an hour , or even longer , to respond . People in that situation can not rely on police protection . In addition , our police force is NOT obligated to serve as a protection force for citizens . Instead , our police are supposed to solve crimes after they occur . People in the US grew up with firearms and shooting sports . Hunting , trap and skeet , and target shooting are important parts of American culture . In fact , our government thought it was so important for citizens to be able to use firearms that they created the Civilian Marksmanship Program ( CMP ) . The CMP sells high-powered military surplus rifles at cost , to US citizens . Joszi and Bram , what experience with firearms do you have ? Maybe a day at the range would change your opinions . pickleweaseler -- The US of A ( the REAL best country to live [ in ] )
Why ? All pro-choicers want abortion to be rare because women are n't having UPPs or health problems in the first place .
The war is n't the reason banks shelled out millions of dollars to people who could never repay it . All that money came from somewhere , like corporations that expected to see a return on their investments . They got nothing , they laid off people as a result , which lead to the rates of unemployment and the housing fiasco .

Just have to say something on this . If the boy scouts didnt receive federal support and get special deals from the government then they would be able to exclude whoever they want . However since they often hold their meetings in public schools for free and rent public lands for discounted price or even sometimes for free they can not discriminate against gays and atheists . So they have to make a choice .
For the record - the level of assistance available ( pregnant or not ) varies from state to state . I was living in New Mexico when I got pregnant and a clever woman working at the welfare office figured out a way to fib to the state to get me the medical care they would have otherwise denied .

Indeed there is no diffrence it is still a dead baby but throwing a baby in a trash can and leaving it for dead is far more cruel than abortion .

I hate to break this to you but this is racked with illogic . Well , ok it 's `` logical '' but the premises rely on things that are pure assumptions . Just because something ca n't be detected does n't mean that it does n't exist . And , of course , if god is god the way we think about it , then God is everywhere , including in this universe . He is the universe ( but we ca n't detect him ) . Does he exist now or not ?
I 'm sure you have n't . But it is a worthy thread because of the reality that Islam `` is '' closing in on what we consider `` the free world '' .

Symbiote declares this the worst thread ever . It is unpleasant , but , Islam will not be denied . The numbers Cruiser provided mean a lot . Especially to progressives .
Your misrepresentation does n't make it so .
Idiotic anti gun/gun control advocates that make remarks about guns being evil are the problem . All of this hatred for an item that does nothing until a person picks it up ! Cars as with guns do nothing until a person operates them . Cars kill far more kids then guns and yet do teachers tell kids cars are evil ? No ! In fact we have an entire business around advertisements to make kids want to buy these deadly cars . More kids die daily while driving to school then from guns and there is not demand for this deadly practice to be stopped . The cost to school districts to make parking facilities for these deadly cars is another burden people pay to make kids want to buy deadly cars . When will there be a demand for car free zones at schools ?

And ? How is that different than what I said ? I simply am saying that there 's a reason it 's active or if it 's not ... .and the reason is diet . If the diet changes in humans , for instance , there may very well be a change in this . Who knows . SS : So at this point we have humans and other primates both consuming diets high in vitamin C , and both containing defective genomes that are unmutated . This is simply the result of eating fruits from the onset of creation , thus not requiring a mutation to create vitamin C internally . Nope the defective gene is itself a mutation of the active form of the enzyme . And the mutation to the defective gene would occurr at random but would only be inherited in linages which have external sources of C in their diet . It is not necessarily the case that such a mutation would occurr in every species with high vit C intake please note . Why are you calling this gene `` defective ? '' It 's not defective . And are you telling me that it 's humans and primates who have mutated -- and not animals that do n't consume diets of vitamin C ? ?
Dealing with a designated nuisance species is n't the same thing as hunting . It 's wildlife management .
Yes , it is interesting how we draw an arbitary `` legal line in the sand '' with regards to determining how late into a pregnancy an elective abortion is available .

And this is known as an ad hominem . What is wrong with the information that I presented in my first post in this thread ? Going off on tangents about SNR 's and information theory may be good topics for another thread , but they are n't helping you here .
You mean you equate the Bible with your own theory ? ( which is lacking information ) .
Sigh . You defend your version of science by re-stating the definition of your version of science . That is circular reasoning . If you read anything on the history of science you will know that your version is but one of many . Isaac Newton sought out the hand of God , through science . He is a prime example of what I mean . He thought differently about science than you ... as science could be used as a tool for furthering his understanding of God .
And there is the difference . The postings I was particularly speaking of have to do with court decisions ( such as Cruikshank ) where hlaf a paragraph , entirely out of context , is quoted to support the anti-gun viewpoint . I have looked at the major anti-gun web pages , I recognise a cut and paste job when I see one . Cutting and pasting a bunch of statistics is one thing , doing the same and making it your entire argument is ignorant .
And the other two ... ?
But most creationists think that it is OK to force their views on everyone by requiring creationism , their religion , to be taught in school . Actually , the public schools have the obligation to teach current science - the best answers that we have today . Today , the United States ranks near the bottom in the knowledge of science and math of graduating secondary school children . Only in our universities do we begin to do the job . But check out the number of foreign teachers we have in our universities . We are doing such a bad job that we have to go elsewhere to find adequately trained individuals .
Much used and abused argument . Ca n't really be proven or disproven until it is tested , so I am not sure there is an argument . This is dramaticized by Hollywood leftists in movies and TV , so it has become this seemingly powerful point . Still not seeing where millions of children should be punished for the likely much fewer women who will seek abortion if it is made illegal .
This is your refutation to science and evidence ; to simply re-state your position . Mach , this is turning into a war of attrition , to see who gives up posting first . I have , however evidence on my side . You have opinion ; and you actually state that evidence will not persuade you !
Via something called `` evidence '' . It is something that a creationist will never have come across , thus explaining why you are unaware of it .

There would n't be any forms or anything even indicating why you are running their background . You just run an SSN and instantly find out if you can legally sell them a weapon .

He did n't refuse because the filmmakers specifically avoided having him a part of it . ( Why , because it would `` confuse '' the viewers .

Riding a dead horse indeed ! http : //opinionjournal.com/columnist ... l/ ? id=110004653 Bellesiles Misfires An antigun `` scholar '' as today 's Galileo ? Oh please , just shoot me . BY KIMBERLEY A. STRASSEL Friday , February 6 , 2004 12:01 a.m. EST History has its fair share of persecuted geniuses , men who were ahead of their time and made to pay for it . There 's the hemlocked Socrates , the house-arrested Galileo , the exiled Rousseau . And to this list of giants it seems that we are now expected to add the name of Michael Bellesiles . Mr. Bellesiles is the former Emory professor who shook the scholarly world in 2000 with his book `` Arming America . '' An academic bombshell , the tome went against long-held beliefs by claiming that few colonial Americans actually owned guns . This set off a riotous public debate over whether the Second Amendment was designed to protect individual gun rights . Mr. Bellesiles was showered with prizes and media praise , becoming an instant academic star . That is , until his peers started looking into that little thing called research . Reputable scholars in the ensuing months tore apart his work on probate and military records , travel narratives , and other documents . Mr. Bellesiles , when asked to explain , provided ever-more outlandish excuses : that his notes had been lost in a flood , that his Web site had been hacked , that he could n't remember where he 'd found certain documents . The officials of the prestigious Bancroft Prize stripped him of his award , he left Emory and Knopf chose to stop publishing his book . Most of us sighed happily and figured that was the end of that academic scandal . But oh , no . It turns out that Mr. Bellesiles is still riding his dead horse , his nonexistent guns still blazing . Soft Skull Press ( which takes pride in putting out books that other publishers avoid like ricin ) has not only agreed to reissue `` Arming America '' but has decided to release Mr. Bellesiles 's latest response to his critics . This 59-page pamphlet , `` Weighed in an Even Balance , '' is a spirited attempt by Mr. Bellesiles to turn himself into the world 's latest misunderstood genius . As such , it 's worth reading for pure entertainment value . Much of the booklet is a repeat of the professor 's creative excuses and dissembling . He explains again about the flood and helpfully assures us that he is not an agent of the Zionist Occupational Government ( though surely that is why the Bancroft panel took away his prize , right ? ) . He does acknowledge a few errors , but only after pointing out that `` even the finest scholars . . . make mistakes . '' As proof , he cites one blooper in esteemed historian David McCullough 's 1,120-page biography of Harry Truman . But the most amusing parts of the pamphlet are those meant to support our scholar 's belief that he is up against a stubborn world that refuses to open its mind to the truth . And his sense of persecution and righteousness is very much on display . The very title of his book is taken from Job : `` Let me be weighed in an even balance , that God may known mine integrity . '' And that 's just for starters . The pamphlet is sprinkled with quotations from thoughtful men , all meant to back up Mr. Bellesiles 's argument that he is fighting the good fight . We hear from Isaiah Berlin : `` Few things have done more harm than the belief on the part of individuals or groups . . . that he or she or they are in sole possession of the truth . '' One epigraph recounts that in the 16th century , Oxford used to fine any student who diverged from the teachings of Aristotle . We are clearly meant to envision a feisty Mr. Bellesiles handing over his shillings to the dons . We are treated to lecturing tracts about the benefits of scholarly disagreement , the complex nature of historical research and the need for academic exploration . And finally , in case readers still are n't getting his drift , Mr. Bellesiles sums it all up in his conclusion : `` There are those who rest their very identity on the notion of a certain , unchanging past . The vision that society is unalterable is not just incorrect , it is dangerously undemocratic , and as such should be of concern to every modern historian . '' In fact , the academic world is hardly a monolothic creature that resists all change . If it were , we 'd still be trying to explain how the sun moves around the Earth . Most historians and scientists are wise enough to realize that new discoveries or interpretations hold out opportunity . But before they completely cast aside mountains of research , they usually demand some proof . Mr. Bellesiles 's problem is n't that he 's misunderstood ; it 's that he still has n't given them any . Or as the old saying goes : `` To be a persecuted genius , you not only have to be persecuted ; you also have to be right . '' Ms. Strassel is a senior editorial page writer for The Wall Street Journal .

My response , included this quote , which is what it was in response to . Evolution most certainly does n't `` contain '' these things , given the widely accepted definition of evolution that I posted..and that you 've read countless times on this same forum . So no , I 'm not mixed up . I am `` curious '' however , why you 're now saying that you are arguing that a tautology is a tautology ? It seems ... misleading the way you try to broaden the tautology of one phrase , to all of evolution , as seen in your statement `` evolution contains tautology '' . Again , I think it 's lack of clarity , possibly intential lack of clarity , in favor of casting doubt on the theory of evolution . Which of course , is n't being debated in science , on the whole . It is being debated by religious people , but that 's to defend a dogma , not to understand the world through rational belief . -Mach

Until you have chosen to stand in uniform between the criminal element and the law abiding in our communities ; until you have felt the anguish of attending a funeral service for a fallen brother , until you have felt the helplessness and shed tears resulting from an inability to prevent someone from seeing harm ; until you have stood upon our streets and offered service in defense against those that would seek to do others harm ; you have no ground on which to stand in making such comments ! ! ! Law enforcement , as a whole , exhibits a love of community that few can even comprehend . Every day we place ourselves in harms way , in the hope that we can prevent some of the evil that lurks in our world . We do this by choice . No one has forced us into this position . We do this because we are of a breed that is able and willing to fight in the face of evil . We do this knowing that it is unlikely that we will win this war , but that it is the fight which matters . Our reward for such service ? ? Last year , my net income was a little over $ 42,000 . We are constantly berated by a public that has no real comprehension of what we struggle with on a daily basis . We are often held in contempt by many , for life and death decisions we make in a split second with little or unreliable information . Our families are often victims of the stresses created by our chosen profession . I have encountered grief over the evils of man that you and many others have no way of even imagining.DO NOT sit safely behind your keyboard , and pretend that you have some insight into what we think and feel , until you are prepared to stand where I have stood for the past twelve years .

So what do you think about the fact that this baby is much younger and smaller and far less developed than many of those who are aborted ? While this baby 21 week baby is living in one hospital room , down the hall a 22/23/24/25/26 ect week baby is being aborted because it was in the wrong place at the wrong time .

So the ultimate answer to whether or not the sun exists comes down to convictions . And you feel it 's just as likely that it does exist , vs does n't exist ? If no , and you think it 's more likely that the sun does indeed exist , then you 're , I 'm guessing here , ultimately contradicting yourself . Truth has nothing to do with conviction , to claim it does is unethical . If you killed my brother and you were completely and utterly convinced that he killed himself , I 'm sorry Black Phoenix , you 're not off the hook . How inhuman can one get ! ! ?

Like they said in the article , you can have a campaign against marrige because it hurts women because of domestic abusers , you can say the baseball hurts men , because many of them get hurt .

Most of the time , abortion lets women let go of that big weight thats holding them back and prusue their dreams , and live a happy life . Since when has AntiAbortionists cared about women ? Can someone fill me in here ?
I like . I have always liked this line of evidence too , but I always forget about it in the fog of war : http : //members.aol.com/darrwin/vestigial.htm # babies
It 's a bunch of bull**** , another attempt at a causation/correlation bait and switch tactic without any evidence to back it up . There are plenty of people who have constant access to firearms , and yet never display violent tendencies . You really should be careful about posting nonsense like this . If your article has any validity , it would be grounds for disarming the police , since them having access to guns would make them more violent towards the people , and more likely to kill innocent bystanders .
Lots of makers are still churning out lever action rifles . I am sad to see Winchester closed , but sad feelings is not a good financial reason to keep a poorly run company open .
Actually your arguement should follow have you ever seen an aborted 2 week old embryo
Thats well known to be an observational artifact .
Even if this vague claim were true , would it weaken evolutionary theory ? No .
If same sex couples are offered equal rights under a PACS ( or some other legally recognized union ) as married couples , why does it matter which `` door '' they come in through ? They get all the same benefits , including the benefits that come when one partner dies . What 's the beef ... except that you ca n't say that you 're `` married '' ?
I believe you can relinquish the child support responsibility if you also relinquish parental rights . Complicated stuff - kind of going through it right now as we are working on revoking my son 's bilogocal father 's parental rights . Once that is done I can not pursue him for support . Plus , plenty of dads do it the easy way , do n't pay , do n't care and disappear .
so a person that doesnt want children to have machine guns and 50caliber weapons is an antigun extremist ? Id hate to know what you think a moderate is .

I was unaware that chocked full and non-existant were synonomous , learn something new everyday . I agree , who would believe in dino to birds after reading this , an XXXXX ? Wrong answer , an evolutionist would . I guess those are synonyms as well . Just so you ca n't say I took it out of context here is Dr. Olsen 's letter in it 's entirety . National Museum of Natural History Smithsonian Institution Washington , D. C. 20560 1 November 1999 OPEN LETTER TO : Dr. Peter Raven , Secretary PRaven @ nas.org Committee for Research and Exploration National Geographic Society Washington , DC 20036 Dear Peter , I thought that I should address to you the concerns expressed below because your committee is at least partly involved and because you are certainly now the most prominent scientist at the National Geographic Society . With the publication of `` Feathers for T . rex ? '' by Christopher P. Sloan in its November issue , National Geographic has reached an all-time low for engaging in sensationalistic , unsubstantiated , tabloid journalism . But at the same time the magazine may now claim to have taken its place in formal taxonomic literature . Although it is possible that Mr. Czerkas `` will later name '' the specimen identified on page 100 as Archaeoraptor liaoningensis , there is no longer any need for him to do so . Because this Latinized binomial has apparently not been published previously and has now appeared with a full-spread photograph of the specimen `` accompanied by a description or definition that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon , '' the name Archaeoraptor liaoningensis Sloan is now available for purposes of zoological nomenclature as of its appearance in National Geographic ( International Code of Zoological Nomenclature , Article 13a , i ) . This is the worst nightmare of many zoologists -- -that their chance to name a new organism will be inadvertently scooped by some witless journalist . Clearly , National Geographic is not receiving competent consultation in certain scientific matters . Sloan 's article explicitly states that the specimen in question is known to have been illegally exported and that `` the Czerkases now plan to return it to China . '' In Washington , in June of 1996 , more than forty participants at the 4th International Meeting of the Society of Avian Paleontology and Evolution , held at the Smithsonian Institution , were signatories to a letter to the Director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences that deplored the illegal trade in fossils from China and encouraged the Chinese government to take further action to curb this exploitation . There were a few fossil dealers at that meeting and they certainly got the message . Thus , at least since mid-1996 it can hardly have been a secret to anyone in the scientific community or the commercial fossil business that fossils from Liaoning offered for sale outside of China are contraband . Most , if not all , major natural history museums in the United States have policies in effect that prohibit their staff from accepting any specimens that were not legally collected and exported from the country of origin . The National Geographic Society has not only supported research on such material , but has sensationalized , and is now exhibiting , an admittedly illicit specimen that would have been morally , administratively , and perhaps legally , off-limits to researchers in reputable scientific institutions . Prior to the publication of the article `` Dinosaurs Take Wing '' in the July 1998 National Geographic , Lou Mazzatenta , the photographer for Sloan 's article , invited me to the National Geographic Society to review his photographs of Chinese fossils and to comment on the slant being given to the story . At that time , I tried to interject the fact that strongly supported alternative viewpoints existed to what National Geographic intended to present , but it eventually became clear to me that National Geographic was not interested in anything other than the prevailing dogma that birds evolved from dinosaurs . Sloan 's article takes the prejudice to an entirely new level and consists in large part of unverifiable or undocumented information that `` makes '' the news rather than reporting it . His bald statement that `` we can now say that birds are theropods just as confidently as we say that humans are mammals '' is not even suggested as reflecting the views of a particular scientist or group of scientists , so that it figures as little more than editorial propagandizing . This melodramatic assertion had already been disproven by recent studies of embryology and comparative morphology , which , of course , are never mentioned . More importantly , however , none of the structures illustrated in Sloan 's article that are claimed to be feathers have actually been proven to be feathers . Saying that they are is little more than wishful thinking that has been presented as fact . The statement on page 103 that `` hollow , hairlike structures characterize protofeathers '' is nonsense considering that protofeathers exist only as a theoretical construct , so that the internal structure of one is even more hypothetical . The hype about feathered dinosaurs in the exhibit currently on display at the National Geographic Society is even worse , and makes the spurious claim that there is strong evidence that a wide variety of carnivorous dinosaurs had feathers . A model of the undisputed dinosaur Deinonychus and illustrations of baby tyrannosaurs are shown clad in feathers , all of which is simply imaginary and has no place outside of science fiction . The idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at Nature and National Geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith . Truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program , which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age -- -the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion . If Sloan 's article is not the crescendo of this fantasia , it is difficult to imagine to what heights it can next be taken . But it is certain that when the folly has run its course and has been fully exposed , National Geographic will unfortunately play a prominent but unenviable role in the book that summarizes the whole sorry episode . Sincerely , Storrs L. Olson Curator of Birds National Museum of Natural History Smithsonian Institution Washington , DC 20560 Ph . 202-357-33212 FAX 1-202-633-8084 email : olson.storrs @ nmnh.si.edu Why do n't you write Dr. Olson and ask him if this is true ?
Yes , Creationist doublespeak at its `` best '' . Once again creeping Creationism seeks to undermine science in little steps . If this latest inroad is not stopped more will follow , rest assured .
Well , I would say they simply disagree with how facts are determined . You will be hard pressed to find someone who says I ignore the hard , solid facts . Everyone believes hard , solid facts . But everyone disagrees about what constitutes hard , solid facts .
Well , that 's not exactly true . I do n't put absolute faith in the results of science , but I do trust that scientists are not lying . They may be wrong , but I do n't defend what they say to the death . I do n't have an absolute belief in what they have found or the conclusions they 've drawn . I tend to `` believe '' the big bang theory , but I have serious doubts as to its validity . I think the ability to change your mind about things as they come is what makes it not faith . Trusting scientists that they are n't lying does n't mean that I have faith in what they say . Faith is a really strong word . edit - Oh , I also realize what you are saying so I 'll try to explain . Scientists publish their results in journals . Their methods and results are there for everyone to see . All you and I have to do is go to a library that subscribes to the journal , or personally subscribe to it , and look up their work . If you had a problem with what they did , you can do your own experiments to prove them wrong , or at least make your case why you think they are wrong . Now , getting your results published is another can of worms . But , anyway , you or I do n't have to be published to redo the experiments ourselves , but that might take some money . Anyway , all I 'm saying is that once something is published , it 's not written in stone . It does n't become infallible scripture . People who read it , `` believe '' it ( or not ) , based on their own knowledge of the subject . Results and conclusions are challenged all the time . Interpretations are modified all the time . I really do n't see what any of this has to do with Faith .
* - edit : you know , actually , evidence in the form of experimental results are reviewed , or at least the methods are reviewed , and then if the experiment is n't reproducible then the evidence becomes suspect , so in that light evidence is , sort of , reviewed . Eh , who cares ? )
Good lesson ! Always take the easy way out to try and avoid consequences of actions . Instead of leaving a note on a car saying you accidently hit you ... you should just casually drive away . Thanks Simone !
That 's just not true . It is a logical fallacy . Evolutionary theory makes no claims to be able to recount every mutation , recombination , migration , random mating , or chance death of every organsim . But the evidence for evolution is beyond dispute . More than 99 % of degreed biologists accept evolutionary theory as the best explanation for the observed data .
I think his point is paulie , that if evolution is actually as evo defines it , as changes made by way of random mutations , then why does n't life reflect those random mutations ? For example , why have n't a large number of lower animals who live their lives being hunted by carnivores adapted eyes in the back of their heads as a needed early warning system to see their stalkers coming from behind them ? Especially in times of drought and famine when food is scarce ? The environmental pressure exists at those times to justify such a change , yet from fish to birds to reptiles to mammals to even insects , most every creature in creation has 2 eyes , 1 mouth , 2 ears , ( if they even have ears since some animals use vibration sensors to locate the movement of prey and predator . ) It makes sense that Eagles , Hawks and Falcons have only 2 eyes since they are apex predators which rule their skies . But they regularly swoop down on smaller birds and pluck them out of the sky for food for their young . So why have n't smaller birds found the need to evolve eyes in the back of their heads ? One reptile has a type of third eye , but it is n't for sight nor is it permanent . It is used to absorb vitamin D from the Sun for the first 6 months of life in order to help it grow into a healthy adult . Then it is covered by scales . Tuatara Fact Sheet But the question persists as to why it seemingly devolved the need for that third eye if it originally had 3 working eyes ? I mean , it did n't simultaneously evolve a poison gland or some other form of defense to replace the need for it . Now let 's look at some insects which you will invariably mention as flaws in my argument . They too have extra eyes called ocelli , not working eyes mind you ; and neither do they aid in sight but the ocelli are simple structures and are believed they only detect light levels and movement . Now why would evolution not give vulnerable flying insects perfect vision when they have allegedly had literally hundreds of millions of years and many reasons to evolve it ? Are you aware that the visual acuity of insects is approximately 1 % of that of humans ? And we all know that humans do n't have the best eye sight in the animal kingdom . MICROSCOPY-UK / MICSCAPE - Insect insights . Insect eyes . Honeybee legs . What really distinguishes evolutionists from creationists is that creationists will ask the questions fear to ask since this fraudulent gospel has so many inconsistencies which ca n't be reasonably or rationally answered , they refuse to even consider them . Keep in mind that I have pointed out scientifically documented realities about what exists within the animal kingdom , but what I will get back from you are what ifs and maybes regarding these inconsistencies . Why is it that you never look at what is evolutionary dogma and ask why if random mutation happens based on environmental , social and predatory pressures , has n't it made more diverse selections where needed , as in a working third eye in the back of animals heads , rather than in all cases follow a proscribed formula which exists today , just as it existed in the oldest fossils ever collected ?
So , when a comedian leaves the stage and say 's I killed tonight , then obviously killing people en-masse is just fine , right ?
Good , it is n't a federal responsibility .
And it explains observations about morphology and physiology , about successions of flora and fauna . It explains coloration . It even explains why pandemic diseases arise and why they fade . It explains why an apparently harmful allele for a particular gene can increase in a population . In short , the theory of evolution explains biology .
And the ability to digest nylon is not a new function ? ? You seem to have a different conception of 'new function ' that what matches with reality .
I do n't think we have any business forcing anyone to do something they do n't want to do . The father is supplying his DNA when he engages in sexual relations . After than point he has in effect signed a blank check . It 's like the old saw , if you do n't want to do the time , do n't do the crime . Fathers to be should n't be engaging in sex unless they intend to pony up with the montly check . I come from a bit of a bias on this subject because this was my area of endeavor for some 20+ years .
Strawman argument . Under the anti-gun standard of review , a straw purchase involves buying a gun for anyone other than yourself , with no exceptions .
I realize you said `` the jury is still out '' , which indicates that if I present evidence for one side , that does not settle it : especially if the statement is some 15 years old . However , the quote is fairly relevant and I know right where to find it , so what the heck not post it .
The amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases ( CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas ) threatens to snowball because of the rapid depletion of available carbon sinks and the consumption of existing ones . The MAIN problem with de-forestations is NOT that the trees are no longer removing CO2 from the atmosphere , but our use of them is adding CO2 to it ( burning , etc . ) and the other sources we could turn to to remove it are also being used up . Methane hydrates in the polar seabeds threaten to rapidly increase the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases as soon as the temperature increases enough to destablize the ice crystals holding them in place .
Yes , we should n't let those slaves be citizens , they will burden our legal system since they will now have ... OMG ... rights !
The problem here is the translation from Hebrew to English . In Hebrew the translation was `` seven pairs '' in the English translation we wrote it as `` seven '' . No contradictions there .
Does this mean that I can use the terms `` fetus '' and `` baby '' interchangeably ? Like can I say , `` I need to find a fetus sitter so I can go out to the movies with my friends . '' When I go car seat shopping , can I ask for `` a seat to put my fetus in ? '' Or when I 'm in a child 's clothing store , can I ask for fetus clothes ?
And what would we have seen 3 months later if this had passed ? Brady 3 ? But hey , there is no slippery slope !
And nowhere does it say she went to her bedroom and retrieved a gun .
And it remains to be seen if your are . Pick an unreasonable and dumb argument go with it .
Walking-fish : A great example of this is the way Young Earthers try to discount radiometric dating . They will choose a couple hundred inconsistent radiometric dates out of the thousands that have been recorded and argue that they are unreliable . Then they will choose a couple lame pieces of evidence for a young earth , such as Robt Gentry 's Polonium halos , rate of decay in the earth 's magnetic field , rates of sediment/salt deposition in the ocean or rate of population growth . This is supposed to outweigh the evidence from thousands of good radiometric dates . Creationists are not very good at doing science but they are good at picking cherries . So if you own an orchard and need a few good field hands , hire a young earth creationist .
Well it does n't go against the US constitution ... Does it go against the California constitution ? I have n't seen much credible evidence for this..then again I do n't know much about the California constitution . Do you ?
Well , I disagree that it discriminates against unmarried heterosexual couples ; those couples still have the choice to get married to recieve the benefits of marriage or stay unmarried . Same-sex couples do not have that choice currently , and all we are talking about is giving them that choice . Unmarried heterosexual couples are not affected and have the same choice available to them . Though now that I think about it , you may be saying that the common law statutes are applies to unmarried opposite-sex couples but not to unmarried same-sex couples ? Well , in all honesty I think that is very unfair regardless of marriage status . The same common law rules should apply to both heterosexual and homosexual couples . I see no reason why this would n't be updated along with marriage . As for common law statutes being used against same-sex partners , well again , that is an argument against marriage or common law statutes , not against same-sex marriage specifically . It is n't a reason to disallow marriage to same-sex couples but allow it for opposite-sex couples .
Well , that 's your own strong bias speaking . Many of the courts and scholars have disagreed with you .
18-19 year olds anyway . It 's still illegal for over the counter under the age of 18 . Wait a minute , I fail to see how it not being availible will affect teenagers doing it or not .
You know what I find amusing here ... your entire argument revolves around how it will affect your wallet . Forget about the lives of the people who are denied rights in this country that you take forgranted . That is the true christian-American spirit is n't it ? Oh how proud our forefathers would be if they could see us now ... oh wait ... most of them owned people ... nevermind .
Ok , now I 'd like to know why Lappster thinks evolution has anything to do with morality ? Do you actually know what evolution is Lappster ?
Not surprised . Violence breeds violence . Read the domestic violence thread , it has relevance .
If a square is opposite to a circle ( and it is n't , by the way ) , then gas/liquid/solid must be opposites therefore you contain opposites ( by your own argument ) , in that you contain elements that are in these 'opposite ' states . It 's an argument I raised before , you said they were n't opposites , now you cite non-opposites ! Why do you keep refuting previous arguments they YOU have made ?
So , he 's immune to new information that contradicts his beliefs . He does n't care , he has his own predetermined conclusions bolstered by reading whatever creationist rubbish he can find , and he simply refuses to let anything else make an impression on him .
Why is it that evolution cant be considered as a mythical tale ? . A tale of how soup turned into a human being , and that has no evidence for all the major links for this story to work ! ... .
Another question might be , have evolutionists figured out the `` mock '' gene yet ? Mockery was a great ingredient in Christian salvation . Judas mocked Jesus in the garden , the chief priests and scribes laughed him to scorn , Herod mocked him , the servants and the soldiers jeered at him and insulted him , and on the cross all sorts of taunts were thrown at him . I do n't claim to be perfect - mockery could possibly be an effective tool in certain instances , but I may be wrong about that . Is mockery synonymous with evil ? The opposite of love ? Do atheists do it more than Christians ?
The guy can have an opinion but the ultimate choice is up to the woman who can listen to what the guy says or not , it 's up to her . I believe that is what sinjin was saying .
But if the fetus is n't a human , then it 's not murder .
But if you actually take time to read the study that is posted on that website it appears that the claims of the NSPOF are doubtful , inconsistent with other studies , and likely biased in favor of people answering that they had used a gun to defend themselves .
And are people in DC legally allowed to carry their guns with them in a concealed manner , having them readily available like the rest of us do in the country ? Absolutely not . According to DC your rights do n't extend past your home , and it barely even exists inside your home .
You asked where the line should be drawn in regards to weapons ? How about where ownership and use of weapons does not violate the rights of others . Before you respons think about it . Do anything you want . If I do n't violate anyone then what is the beef ? If I do n't break any laws or endanger anyone what is the beef ? The safe storage and handling of cannon , cannon propellant , and cannon ammo is well known . They can be stored in places typical of homes without violating the rights of others . BTW a cannon is not a weapon . It is considered a 'firework ' by the ATF . Ever see a civil war renactment ? Lots of cannons ? So yes having a cannon in your front yard does fly .
Great news !
Actually , it 's true . One Darwin 's basic ideas upon which he based the theory of natural selection .
Yes , I remember , and I agree . Johnny was just primping for the cameras . I do believe though that historically men have been vain and will continue to be so . Your expression of machoism in the toughness of your truck is just another vanity . Vanity can be expressed by the pride one takes in the amount of mud hanging on the four wheeler after a spin in the backwoods . Face it , BO . You 're just a vain man , such as I am . Our quest to have the biggest , baddest truck on the block is not much different from a woman wanting to be the belle of the ball . And often men express their vanity in the `` possession '' of a trophy wife .
Oh , buddy , Atheism has EVERYTHING to do with that . The morality-less framework of Atheism ALLOWED them to justify the horrors that they inflicted .
You are correct . That fossil species have gone extinct is an observation .
So what ? Whether killing is a personal or impersonal matter , the bottom line is that somebody IS going to be killed and that 's all there is to it . I highly doubt somebody 's BEING killed is of less importance than HOW they were killed .
No worries mate . Brooklyn & # 39 ; s 81st Precinct probed by NYPD for fudging stats ; felonies allegedly marked as misdemeanors New York cops 'fudge ' stats like the Tories to make their `` strict gun laws '' look more compatible to the States that do not have draconian anti gun laws and need not depend on the cops protecting you when they have no duty to do so . I have been following UK stats for a long time and no matter who is in power , the crime rates increase . Often the perp is set free and the victem is the one punished like the incident you mentioned : Pushing someone out the way while attempting to escape is a violent crime under UK law . Gun control is not crime control ! It is just more evident in the UK . At least here you can still shoot the _____________s and that is a great deterrant
And that just scares me .
Let 's see , what else in science is n't the absolute truth ... .. Well , it 's still the heliocentric theory , so the earth orbitting the sun is n't the absolute truth . It 's still the germ theory so germs and viruses causing disease is n't the absolute truth . It 's still the atomic theory so atoms are n't the absolute truth and since chemistry stems from the atomic theory ( chemicals and elements are , according to the theory , made up of atoms ) chemistry is n't the absolute truth . gravity ca n't be the absolute truth because it 's still the theory of gravity . And electricity sure ca n't be the absolute truth because it 's part of the electromagnetic theory . It should also be noted that the theory of evolution is one of the most well supported theories in science , even though it is n't the absolute truth .
Did you actually read your own links ? I was holding those in reserve to prove my comment . Interesting reading non ? It seems the wars are repetitious and always involve a tyrant and his government and other wan na be 's like Vichy in France capitulating with Hitler . Most of the Free Army was composed of whom ? When did the resistance begin and are you making the argument that `` resistance is futile '' or that resistance is effective ? No doubt Sarge will have some insight on the sitop also ?
Thanks man ! Too bad I ca n't do anything today
Sorry about that . I meant Atheists . And by modern , I mean present-day .
Actually the bible is silent concerning abortion which is odd considering it was highly outlawed by surrounding nations.The bible is very clear concerning the value of a fetus as opposed to an actual soulish being ( mother ) though .
I see what you were trying to start say about confusing common sense , with a myth . But what a myth is to you , is n't a myth to others . Some people go on common sense , some people go with there hearts , and some people go with what they have enormous faith in . All of the above are not stupid ! So dont say that they are ! I go on common sense , but what I have faith in means to much to me to just push aside entirely .
Peoples Republic of Kalifornia East it looks like to me .
actually , the only valid question plotter asked is about the existence of dinosaurs ( How did they fit into the creation schedule ? ) Good question plotter ... Plotter : `` when did he create all the other planets , when did he create all the other stars and comets ? '' Gen. 1:14 And God said , `` Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate the day from the night ; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years , 15 and let them be lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth . '' And it was so . and XQ , what stories are you talking about ?
What ? ? You mean their society did n't implode due to giving civil unions to all , under the weight of legal quagmire as some who have argued against this from the gay pride movement have asserted ? ? The sky did n't fall ? Imagine that .
He may not hate it , but he sure does some strange things WRT it . For example : his World Apology Tour 2009 .
Where do you get that impression from ?
Ah , so I take it you are saying is it possible to reconcile a belief in God ( of some sort ) with the discoveries of science ? Well I hope it is as long as one never lets a religious belief stand in the way of objective analysis of evidence from the physical world .
I do n't think people have a right to kills themselves ( obviously not natural and obviously not legal right now ) . As for the other question , I would n't think a blatent disregard for the others health is morally ok .
** Well , there it is . You have 'gone over to the dark side ' . Too bad . I hope it 's a temporary lapse , but if not , our debate was quite good while it lasted .
Ouch . That leads to an easy refutation .
Why would you be regretful , if it 's your choice , and you stand by it ? What if you honestly and truly did not want a child in the future ? To speak for everyone and say , there will always be regret , or else you are callous , is the problem here . This is the cultural conditioning I was speaking of earlier which stigmatizes those who make a choice .
Believing evolution leads to liberalism ! ( which is closely related to the Nazis ) Damn you Darwin for leading us into a tax-and-spend , arbortion loving , crystal wearing , Stalinist , anti-semetic dystopia ! !
Really ? Look above ; all I have to do is repeat things I 've already told you to respond to your `` debunkings . ''
No i dont ... as im a plurilist ... .
But the problem is with determining whether or not a person ACTUALLY is guilty . If we could determine 100 % for sure whether or not a person is guilty , I would definitely be pro-death penalty . However , I do n't think it is worth the risk to sacrifice one innocent life in order to punish others .
I could n't have said it any better myself . Could I use that quote ?
Just how do you arrive at that conclusion ?
No , it does n't . Our genotype ( together with other epigenetic modifiers ) gives us a much bigger brain than chimps , although it is structured very similarly . On top of that , what we accomplish with our bigger brain is , as I 've already demonstrated in other threads with reference to feral children , greatly dependent upon the accumulated wisdom imprinted upon the brain during infancy . We teach our children to problem-solve . We teach them language and abstract thought - we train the various parts of the brain to do their job properly . We are n't born 'complete ' . Even as adults , not everyone is equally quick-witted , not everyone has an equal facility for logical thought - and this has a lot to do with how their brain has been trained during its development . Other apes can also be taught these same concepts - to a more limited degree , sure , but then the related parts of their brain are smaller and less capable .
They did n't . Simple as that . Now , let 's look at the post you keep quoting ( although it has already been addressed by others ) . First one , Job 40 : 15-24 , seems to describe a Hippo ( possibly an elephant ) . As to the second one , please show me a fire breathing dinosaur and you 'll be in business with your claim that they described dinosaurs . Otherwise , there 'll be quite a bit of mocking and scoffing at their claim of fire-breathing creatures . Aside from the fire breathing thing , it sort of sounds like the Nile Crocodile or something of the sort .
** Excuse me , walkingfish , for butting in , but I 'd like to reiterate my point to schuster that Darwin 's theory of `` Natural Selection '' is just an outgrowth of an ancient social rationalization for unequal distribution political/economic power and privilege , ( that is , social elitism , aristocracy and racism ) , falsely and anthropomorphically applied to non-human life .
And the reasons have been discussed at length and most of us agree about the mother 's life being endangered or possibly in cases of rape and incest ... ... ... Where we disagree with you is unecessary abortions ... such as for birth control , a headache on just and inconveniencce ... ... .. You think any abortion is alright ... We do n't ... ..
Well , yes , I can assert anything is true if I am allowed to make up new science to explain it . As you may have noticed , rocks do n't bend very easily - a sudden force ( by `` sudden '' I even mean increasing the pressure on a rock over a time that may seem long to people ) will shatter a rock . In the Himalayas , Rockies , Appalachians , we see that the strata are smoothly folded over long distances . This is only possible by applying great pressures over very long periods of time , at pretty high temperatures . A sudden collision of the continents at the end of the flood would produce very different geologic features . That is the difference between accepted geologic theories and creationist theories . Geologic theories rely on known scientific laws and principles , whereas the creationists have to either make up brand new scientific theories and principles ( like the infamous changing speed of light ) and/or ignore evidence that directly contradicts there hypotheses .
`` Babies '' are a stage reached after birth . If you are talking about abortions , then no babies are involved , anti-choice , histrionic revisionist linguistics none withstanding
This is a laughable oversimplication of reproduction . Humans do n't make copies . Do you reproduce asexually ? I know I do n't .
I did . You did not , and you did not read context . My response was based on the Chihuahua/Great Dane remark . Your source says they have the same basic set of genes . This is not the same as saying that all genes are the same . You go on to say , `` Their size and shape obviously have nothing to do with genetics , '' and imply that this is all phenotypic plasticity . Put your money where your mouth is , bub : Invest in a pedigreed Great Dane and a pedigreed Chihuahua . Breed them each to a pedigreed member of the same breed ( i.e . GD × GD and Chihuahua × Chihuahuah , not inter-breed mating ) . Raise them in identical environments . According to you , all the offspring should have the same phenotype . Publish your results . You 'll be rich . Go ahead . It should only take a few months . Again , you 'll be rich . What are you waiting for ?
When the pro-life movement began in the early 70 's , being pro-life meant you were 100 % opposed to any and all abortion . In the early 80 's , that standard was watered down to include those who had rape , incest , and the life of the mother exceptions . Now in the 90 's , things have declined so rapidly that someone who is only opposed to partial-birth abortions can sell themselves as pro-life . `` - Pastor Matt Trewhella How does that crow taste ?
Actually , we do . These inconsistant laws are a product of pro-life people trying to create a stepping stone to a national ban . Crimes against pregnant women should warrant a more serious offense , not an entirely new offense .
We 're legally dead when we no longer mentally exist ( hence the term `` brain-dead '' ) , so there is no logical reason to set the beginning point as anything other than the start of the mental existence . Just as people who are dead and without mental existence do not have the ability to obtain rights , a collection of human cells without a mental existence can not obtain rights . I also notice you have resorted to attacking other people 's views rather than following the topic of the thread , which is to share YOUR views .
So try actually responding to the points I 'm making rather than just making up stuff to attack me over .
That is so non-specific as to be nonsense . How is that comment relevant to any discussion that has gone before ? Who has ever claimed that body parts are made up by placing one gene on top of another . I suspect that the remark is the direct result of your ignorance of the topic .
Did you read the TOPIC ? Evidently not ! Your assignement , should you attempt to take it , is to state your thesis and prove it by fact and not guess and assumptions and WA claims . I have no interest in trying to prove some wall eyed statement from a mouth breather . It is not my job to try to prove your hypotehesis based on guess and innuendo . The facts have been in long ago , posted and you ignored them now you come in to MUDDY THE WATERS AND PRETEND FACTS NEVER EXISTED .
That 's not entirely true . For example , a country that is n't already saturated with , say , handguns , would imo greatly suffer if handguns were suddenly legalised . Banning handguns in a country that is saturated already , is imo , idiotic . -Wez
( Sorry to hear you lost an hour 's worth of work ... I hate it when that happens ! ) I may not have made this clear , but here are the facts : 1 ) A unique human entity comes into existence at the point of conception/fertilization . It is pointless to argue this fact , because the evidence to suggest that this is true is insurmountable . The zygote/blastocyst/embryo/fetus/neonate/baby/child ( whichever label you choose ) is a member of the species homo sapiens sapiens . Period . 2 ) Just because something is human does not necessarily make it a 'human being ' or a 'person . ' These are not scientific terms . It is impossible to 'prove ' that a pre-birth human entity is a 'human being ' under all possible interpretations of a 'human being . ' The argument could be made , for example , that a 'being ' must have some sort of self-awareness . It would be quite difficult to find evidence that suggests that a developing human blastocyst has any self-awareness . So , to answer your question , regardless of what anyone believes , a post-conception entity formed from a human sperm and a human ovum is a unique human entity from that point on . My question to you : What do you consider to be the reason the pre-birth baby is a 'human being ' that deserves 'personhood ' according to the law ?
I think they have more of a chance becasue , while many manage to delude themselves into believing that an unborn child is not a baby , it would be much more difficult to convince yourself that a crying baby is n't a baby . Even in the animal kingdom ( which we are all part of ) you see some animals hesitate to kill the young of their own species . Evne coyotes will not generally kill a pup ( I have even seen a pack of coyoptes pass a domestic pup without killing it , though they could have . I am told this is because of the stubby nose , which shows the coyotes that it is , indeed , a puppy , even though it looks unfamiliar to them ) .
So those who will allow more gun control , should n't you first have to justify the need , then prove that what you want and propose , will work as advertised before we allow you to burden our Inalienable Right as protected by the various Constitutions ?
Yes , I would . The term is not simply just words . The definition of Civil Unions do not allow for the over 1,100 rights , liberties and protections granted to otherwise Legally Married couples . Civil Unions are non-transportable , meaning a civil union from one state can not be recognized in other states . Now if you would like to call ALL legally recognized unions as Legal marriage , fine . That goes for heterosexuals as well . I just ca n't see that a heterosexual couple would ever want to enter into a `` civil union '' being as they would be denied spousal recognitions and transportability . I have als been asked before , in another forum , if I would be opposed to leaving the decission up to individual states . My answer is , yes . Due to the fact that legal marriages between heterosexual couples are granted federal recognition , benefits and interstate transportability which would be denied to Civil Unions if left up to individual states . Also we all know what would have happened if individual states were allowed to have determined women 's right to vote , interracial marriage and de-segragation . None of those would have happened . Sometimes the general public just does n't know what 's best for their state 's citizens . Much of the voting public is simply just too under-informed or misinformed . HR3313 ( Protection of Marriage Act ) and DOMA ... MUST be repealed and steps to make all rights equal must be taken . The issue of gay marriage rights is indeed a civil rights issue . There is no way around it .
It has been shown in evidence all around the world with something as fragile as a leaf extending through multiple varves . The Geologic Column
Lott still has his job . There is a big difference .
Good point .
Well , your question does n't need the macro bit in there as evolution happens or it does n't , the `` macro '' bit is once again an artifact of our view on the world ( ie . our short lives make it rather difficult to see evolution shape anything other than the organisms with the fastest of reproductive cycles . ) Given we have evidence of life ( fossils ) changing over time ( radiometric dating and stratigraphy ) we know it takes many of thousands , if not millions of years for noticable to-the-eye changes in animals to occur . Once again it is important to consider perspective- we only have the equivalent of a few frames ( fossils ) from the movie of life ( geological time ) and there is much that is lost to history forever . Still , enough remains to support evolution , unless you were to purposefully disregard the facts we find . On your final point it is rather out of context , and I suspect not accidentally so . I 'm not sure what on earth consitutes `` convincing evidence '' for any philosphical outlook on life , be it theistic or otherwise .
Really ? Are you denying that evolutionists use the 'random monkey ' example ? There were many typewritters around since , according this , 1714 `` The patent for the first typewritter was given to Henry Mill in 1714 but it had so many problems and was not able to be used . From there came William Burt in 1829 with the same idea to make a system of moving keys to be printed on paper ; his as well was unsuccessful . Finally in 1868 with much researching and playing around with ideas of past inventors Christopher Latham Sholes invented the American typewritter. `` http : //www.sunysuffolk.edu/~wooda87/aw.html
No it does not . God never attempted to provide proof anyway , aside from the testimony of a few witnesses . He leaves it to every person to decide for himself and believe in him or not . He requires that we believe in him without solid evidence based solely on the changed lives of those who do believe . Anyone who searches for indisputable evidence of Gods existence will not find it . There will be no physical evidence , no wonders , no miracles , no voice from the sky . You will only see God working in the lives of people or within your own life . That is the basis of faith . To believe what you can not see .
Halton Arp is far from suppressed . Any complaints about telescope time echo the complaints of astronomers everwhere that have to clamor and compete for the same telescopes . And I just looked up Gentry because I 've never heard of him . I 'd say that if he is `` suppressed '' then its merely due to the fact that he has n't survived the peer review process . This is true for any number of people who have devised alternate theories to the BB . None of these guys has a beef with godless creation , they just think they have the right answer . There are people into the plasma universe , and the electric universe , or whatever , then there are people like Eugene Savov and his `` fireworks '' universe . These people are generally considered crackpots , but they are n't pushing creationism , they are just pushing theories weaker than the BB theory . But really , the BB theory has problems all over the place , most physicists will admit this . But Alton Harp has n't produced enough of these `` weird '' redshift images to have any significant statistical impact . I think he has cataloged a few dozen of these , most of which can be explained away . The ones that ca n't are just curiosities . Then there is n't a systematic way to look for these things , so any telescope time he applies for would be taken up by random searching , which is probably why someone else gets the telescope time .
face it -- life has stumped science -- it can not be defined , it can not be measured ... it can not be explained in any sort of scientific way .
1 . When their mind develops and begins working . 2 . When their mind stops working . 3 . No , it should not , at least until its mind develops . 4 . No , they are no longer living , and can not exist without their brain .
Nice job not addressing anything I said . I am not a radical , just informed . I used to work for a sexual violence center and counseled rape victims in college . I am also a victim . Keeping myself up to date on sex crimes is important to me , partly because I want all that can be done to prevent it done . Pointing a finger at gays like this does not do that . This pyschologist sums it up nicely : http : //psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbo ... lestation.html
So we do n't ? I thought we had the capacity to destroy it . That seems within the range of control eh ?
And that does n't make you wrong ? But it only applies here despite the mountain of evidence saying I 'm so wrong that I have fecal matter coming out of my pores ! That does n't make you right . Just foolish . And as others have stated in past threads , all that is required to prove your atheistic evolution # # # # claims false is a single theist accepting evolution . As you were annihilated in that formal debate , there 's not much question that your beliefs are not only narrow , but completely self serving and unable to comprehend or incorporate airtight refutations of your asinine claims . in laymans ' terms , you plug you ears and say la-la-la-la when you 're wrong . And you 're not doing very well in that thread . More evidence that you 're not only massively dishonest ( not that anyone disagrees ) but you love cherry picking and ignoring how you 've been ground into dust
Yes , but all concepts of right or wrong are subjective .
Yes , i agree with you .
Sorry , but what you do not realize is that we kicked out European forms of government in 1776 . We saved European governments in WW2 . The USA was the very FRIST government ever to be rulled by common and free men . When the USA first had the vote , Europe still had kings and emperors . Europe has become more like the USA and needs to work harder to become more like the USA . The USA had true freedom for more than 100 years before Europe started to get rid of their kings . In a few European countries they still have thier kings . I do not want to see a return of kings the the USA . Europe is almost like the USA , they just need to try a little harder .
I believe in both creationism and evolution . I realize the evolution process is still going on today . I do n't feel the need to debate the issue as it would probably be a moot point for all involved . All I wanted was some honest answers to my questions .
It 's a valid scientific theory which has been successful .
Yeah , but everything that creationists ca n't deny is claimed to fit the Biblical picture . Please cite the verses . How could all of this tectonic activity have happened in just a few few years after the mythical flood ? You do know that it produces heat , do n't you ?
Only a complete XXXXX , devoid of even the slightest measurable amount of critical thinking skills , would support Chicago 's handgun ban .
But the difference is , if you take a swing and hit someone , or harm them in a worse way , you can get locked up for it . But no cop is going to bar the door to a chapel where you get married to a same-sex partner , and you wo n't be arrested afterwards . Yes , it 's completely legal for you to do that , right now . Apples and oranges .
Yes because it is `` officially '' a life . Whether a person believes in life at conception or not they all agree it is life at birth and half way through life it is still life and right before death it is still life . If she does not want the child she can refrain from sex , use a contraceptive or abortion . If he does not want it he can refrain from sex ( not likely for men ) , use a condom ( not a guarantee to work ) , have surgery ( hard to reverse ) but that is it . So if he was to use a condom and get her pregnant she still has the last option .
I know something of philosophy , and feel free to use Kant to refute me . I did not say God is necessary for a moral code to exist , I said some sort of Supreme Being is necessary for a moral code to exist objectively outside the human mind . What is your support that we do not know whether it is a person or not morally ? I tell you now , a fetus is not morally a person to me . There , you are refuted .
Can you tell us who this `` Professor of Evolution '' is ? There are lots of booklets called entitled `` Evolution : Fact or Fiction '' and all ( aFAIK ) are written by evangelicals with next to no knowledge of evolution at all . Sadly such `` Christians '' are happy to lie about their qualifications if it helps them spread doubt about science . I suspect what you are referring to is one such booklet , but I need a name to know for sure .
Yet , tehre seem to be people who remember taking the poll . Regardless , in his report it was a minor point . From a realistic standpoint , it took nothing away from the report when he removed it . Lott was investigated for this , just like Bellisiles . He was not found guilty of any academic misconduct ( unlike Bellesiles ) . When you consider the thousands fo data sets that he compiled to put that report together , the folks investigating him did n't think it was at all unbelieveable that he scoudn ; t remeber the details of where that number came from . Again , though , he ended up removing that number from his report ( the single place that it appeared ) and apologised for using it since he could not provide the raw data or a good cite for it . Here is how he responded to the article you link to : http : //johnrlott.tripod.com/malkinsoped.html It is rather interesting , and well documented . It addresses a couple of inacuracies in the article , such as the misconseption that he had attributed the disputed numner to Kleck .
Well , you are talking to Mr. Statistics here so I am quite aware of how few abortions result from women who become pregnant following rape ... . the numbers are not hard to find even from the sort of `` official '' unbiased sources many pro-lifers seem so quick to decry . For example , first hit on Google . Or if you have the patience to read it , this article . Now we settled that , you are asserting it is fine to deny the women of South Dakota access to abortion if they are pregnant from a rape just because they are in a minority . I have problems with such an approach .
No , the article that you linked to claimed the report said that gun control is ineffective . However , the report itself made no such claim- only that there was not evidence to conclusively establish one way or the other that gun control is effective or ineffective .
Not really ; genetics has a hell of a lot to do with it . How do you think most hot women and attractive men get that way ? Beauty sleep ? ( Oh , wait , must be plasticity ... )
1 ) The context changes nothing . The comment is the same with or without more sentences surrounding it . 2 ) `` rejected giving marriage rights/benefits to unmarried straight couples '' ? ? ? That 's like saying , `` I believe that black votes should not be counted , and whites who choose not to vote should also not have their votes counted . '' To try and compare a situation where one group has the CHOICE to use a right , and then chooses not to , to a second group that is DENIED that choice , is mind-bogglingly absurd .
Does that mean you are also aganist invitro fertilization ?
Oh . Dammit , at least make it a little more obvious . By the way some of these people think on this forum it sounded pretty realistic to me .
Come on , it wo n't make you an XXXXX . It will make you a lazy , forgetful slob if you let it . Nobody 's saying that marijuana is health food , they 're just saying as a drug it 's no worse than certain currently legal drugs .

So ? There are other articles and books that do . Is your link the ultimate authority on the cause of crime ?
If you were the real Evelyn Waugh who converted to catholicism you would know the answer to your question by now
The character of God seems to be in the eye of the beholder ... Or non-existant .
Because the theory of evolution is the result of science and therefore should be taught in science class . ID is NOT science and therefore should NOT be taught in science class . It 's that simple .
So lets us and gays be honest when they/us talk about their 'right ' to marriage . We should not argue that gays should have the 'right ' to marry we should argue that the definition of ' marriage ' should be changed . Whether you have or have not any objections to gay marriage only matters to you . What matters is the opinions of the people who individually or collectively can change the law
Unfortunately for you , that is not shown , the evidence points in one direction , and one direction only . That of evolution and to the fact that the flood never happened .
Well , because the value of that life does n't depend on what the perosn does , it is independent from that . I want to protect human life , that 's why murderers go to jail , but I ca n't kill a person as penalty because I deny that very desire to protect life . What¡s the difference , then , between the state killing a crimminal that has been condemned by a court , and me going to a jail and doing it myself ? Should I be put in jail ? Was n't I performing justice ?
Well Ladywolf , that is really more of an argument than it is an honest question . If marriage was truly a private affair that impacted nobody outside the couple themselves , then , yes , that question would be valid . But that is a very shallow understanding and a very uninformed understanding of the nature of marriage , because marriage is just as much  if not more so  about the community as it is about the couple themselves . But it 's not the community that gets married . No , it 's not the community that gets married , but it 's the community that enforces marriage and develops marriage . We need to understand that marriage is just as much a social norm  a social ideal  of the kind of behavior that we expect and need for a healthy vibrant society ; as much as it is about the emotional commitment of two people . One of the biggest issues is the social role of marriage . Marriage domesticates men . Men who are not attached permanently to a woman are men that will practice and engage in socially unhealthy behaviors at a much higher level . How will same-sex marriage effect the concept of `` marriage '' ? Marriage becomes reduced down to nothing , because the moral argument for same-sex marriage is the same moral argument for group marriage , for polygamy , and it is going to be impossible to deny polygamous groups  and group marriage people  who come forth in all sincerity and say , `` If you ca n't restrict marriage to only couples of opposite sex , then you ca n't restrict marriage to only two people . '' They are all very much interwoven . The three things that you lose are : 1 ) the domesticating influence of marriage on men ; 2 ) the protective influence of marriage upon women from being victimized and objectified by men ; and 3 ) it provides mothers and fathers for children . When monogamy is lost as an ideal , the idea that a man should commit himself and forego all other sexual relationships but ( the one with ) his wife , then women become commodities to be used and collected by men . When committing yourself to a woman and subjugating your sexual desires for the sake of that woman  when that becomes just one lifestyle choice among many , it is devastating to a culture . Same-sex `` marriage '' also denies every child it touches access to either a mother or father . It is never compassionate to intentionally deny a child either a mother or father .
Because we have different experiences than you and are more educated on the subject . The only ones who tend to ask `` Why do you feel you need a firearm to protect yourself '' are the ones who 've never faced such a situation and do n't know what it 's like to be in such a position .
And ill continue to have pity for abused and unplanned pregnant women lacking basic healthcare .
Microevolution has occured . Several times over and recorded in the lab and the natural world .
My goal was not to state a precise definition because as you say everyone is different but to say the age that a person becomes aware in a substantial way . As far as I can see puppies are probably more functional then human babies are probably just as intelligent . I dont see why you would have trouble with the comparison .
And his argument ( or lack therof ) is gone .
That argument cuts both ways . The question comes up regarding what 's YOUR beef on the issue ? Why are you so insistent on maintaining two separate groups ? Is it because you want to reserve marriage as `` prestigous '' whereby gays are kept out ?
Really ? Oh , derrrr ! Obviously , some people no longer use a sense of humour ; a relic .
Bertvan : Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis proposes that living individual organisms , not their genomes , respond to internal and environmental challenges , intelligently and purposefully , that such adaptations are inherited epigenetically , as they develop , and the phenotype only instigates a reorganization of its genome to reflect such adaptations if they persistent over many generations .
Did you get this from a website or did you actually go and browse the journals ? I 'm guessing the former as these objections have been specifically addressed before . Do you really expect to learn anything by copying creationist argument after creationist argument from websites that usually requires an understanding , that has taken biologists years to learn , then simply say `` here , deal with this '' ? Yet when the errors are explained you simply move on to the next subject . I asked myself some time ago , `` What would it take to convince myself that evolution is a good explanation for biodiversity '' , then I set out a series of subjects I did n't understand , read as much creationist material as I could find , then juxtaposing it with as much evolutionary material as I could find and tried to see who was most convincing . Three years and half a biological science degree later I came to several conclusions . 1 ) Creationists have little understanding about the nature of science and evolution for many reasons . 2 ) Evolutionary Biologists have already thought of objections that take creationists years to come up with and debunked them several times over , or made appropriate changes to hypothesis with explanations that are several orders of magnitude more impressive than any creationist material . 3 ) Creationists will obstinately perpetuate falsehoods with inordinate banality , misquote out of context , demonise and vilify beyond logical explanation . 4 ) Evolutionary theory is predictive , falsifiable , consistent , parsimonious and well established amongst the scientific community ; it is the best scientific explanation for biological diversity . As much as I hate saying `` here read this '' , hip morphology is confusing and complicated but is well explained in the journal of dinosaur palaeontology . Follow the link if you want to resolve the confusion with hips . Let 's try and keep it civil people .
Yep life is sometimes incredibly fine tuned . Create and maintain an oddball environment and some existing species will move in or if there is no existing species which can use the environment something may well eventually evolve to do so . Microbes are incredibly efficient at this because of their short generation times . So are things like nematodes etc .
That can be easily remedied .
Yes . I know of no one who agrees with all government policies , or all of the premesis that they 're based on . But we do all agree ( or at least almost all ) that we need some method for forming those policies . Compromises must be made . A religious secularist could believe , for example , that if we allow religious beliefs to dictate policy than it 's just a matter of time before general religious freedom is compromised for all but those who follow the religion of the ruling party . Rather than risk that they would think it an acceptable compromise to have some policies that they do n't agree with , as long as they do n't actively compromise their faith .
The `` flood : scientifically possible ? '' thread is evidence that arch ignores essentially everything scientifically and factually relevant about the flood . Fossil record shows sorting largely by complexity , not density . Huh . That 's magic water ! Geological record lacks a uniform layer of sediment similar to the K-T iridium layer . Magic water again ! Geological record does n't support massive geological changes happening in 4,000 years . Magic Land perhaps ? Basic marine organisms ca n't tolerate massive salinity changes . Maybe Noah had a giant magical aquarium ?
This is a poor poor analogy . Abortion is dealing with the decision to end another 's life in order to sustain a preferred lifestyle . I think you may have been better off putting it this way . Say you dont drive drunk ( personally against it for whatever reason ) . However , you believe others should have the right to drive drunk if they so choose . So , you are personally against drunk driving but you are `` pro-choice '' in that regard ( meaning you believe every person should make that determination for themselves ) . Therefore there should be no laws preventing it and no punishment for the sad results . Pro-life would be : You do n't drive drunk ( morally against it perhaps ) and you are going to make sure no one else is able to either .
Too bad evolution is a scientific theory and an empirically verified fact .
Even new Justice Sotomayor , who claimed she ruled by precedent will be bound by the Heller Decision if she remains true to her purported philosophy . The debate between Sui Juris and Res Judicia should no longer be an issue with the liberals on this RIGHT ! It either applies to all or it applies to none which would result as Justice W.O . Douglas wrote : `` a revolution '' . It is in the government 's ( federal especially ) best interests to keep our soldiers employed in foreign countries . BTW , I think the court decision in Nunn vs. State of Georgia did the best summation of this right !
Well , your thinking with a given market of a few . Public school is monopoly , and the price is way out of line according to the real demand . I 'm quite sure that it would adjust accordingly ... hell , if one could afford a computer , then one can afford an education via online .
Your argument is akin to saying `` We ca n't stop people over-dosing on heroin , so let 's legalise it '' Why have limitations on hand-grenades or mines ? People use mines all over the world for bad . Obviously laws are n't going to work ... but perhaps the laws are also suggestive of a particular ethos ; a set of standards that the community believe are necessary for a civil society . Thus , a nation such as New Zealand , or Australia , promotes a more 'community-minded ' citizen then an 'individualisticlly-minded ' citizen . This also carries over into general attitudes towards one 's neighbours . In America , you 're in fear that what little you have is going to be plundered by blacks or hispanics , or commies or someone . Even the government 's out to rip away your rights . This 'seige ' mentality permeates American society . For the interest of those who are n't aware , gun ownership for self-protection ( from nasty criminals ) is not protected by the Constitution ... it is written to state that a well-armed militia is necessary for the protection of rights .
I think I said . I DO N'T CARE .
And how many murderers have got away with it because they lured their victim to their home ? And how many people have got away with killing someone just for trespassing . I 'm glad I live in a civilised country where the aim is to avoid people getting killed .
Ah , IIDB stands for Internet Infidels Discussion Board . It 's a board similar to this one , only a large portion of the posters there are actual professionals in fields like evolutionary biology , etc ( I beleive we have a few scientists and teachers here - I 'm a Geological Engineer myself , but not even close to the large amount of experts there ) . It 's really a good place to educate yourself in evolution and various other fields ( I know I 've learned a lot there ) . There are also plenty of other subjects ( similar to the Religion and other sections on here ) . If you want to check it out , it 's at http : //http : //iidb.org/vbb/index.php
Absolutely .
Wind goes north , south , east , and west , and it 's always blowing somewhere , how does this relate to any kind of a scientific understanding of wind ? Record the conversation of any two Joe Sixpacks in a coffee shop as they talk about the weather and you have about the same level of science involved .
Nonsense . You are a theist because you assert the existance of a god . Most atheists do n't assert anything . They just do n't believe that a god exists . One does not need absolute knowledge . Since there is no evidence for a god , an atheist does n't believe in one . You are confused . You are confused when you make it a positive assertion . That 's funny . A YEC who claims to think for himself . A freethinker is one who rejects dogma , especially that of religion . The fossils are dated by a variety of methods . One of the best is to date a layer of volcanic ash .
The fossils do n't look like modern species . That is why they are put in different genera , nay , different families . Would you like to supply us with photos of fossils and modern species ? And a detail , taxonomic comparison that indicated how they are the same species ? -
Half of all firearms-related deaths are suicides . Out of the remaining 11 to 15 thousand deaths , the vast majority are the results of police shootings or gang wars . Neither of these are linked to widespread legal gun ownership , nor can they be curtailed with evermore laws . Only a fool would believe more laws against guns will affect gang members .
Shotguns are used for hunting . BB guns are n't useful when robbing a store as they 're too 'weak ' . I see no legal use handguns can fulfil , although I 'm fairly neutral on banning them , if the country is already saturated with them . I do n't see what it 's going to achieve ; the people who will mis-use the guns already have them . If there were no handguns in Canada I would support the ban , but as presumably there are already lots , I do n't think the ban 's a great idea . -Wez
Attending church cuts risk of death ? Methinks your little website is biased . As for stem cell research , I am for whatever works best . We should not compromise on something worse than stem cells because of a moral issue . Stem cells are simply cells , nothing more . To suggest otherwise is ridiculous . However , if adult stem cells hold the key , and are more promising than embryotic stem cells , fine . Whatever works best , but this is not a moral debate . This is a science debate . To suggest this has something to do with advocating for a woman 's right to abortion is absurd . This is about helping people only , born people . Real people .
Why not , think about it . No rules , all we are , are animals . If atheism is true , that is what we are left with . Go ahead make an argument for morality .
Actually , no . It has been quite conclusively shown that the theory of relativity is correct . It is the sign of a scientific illiterate to claim that a theory is somehow doubted because it has n't been `` proven . '' No theory grows up to be a law .
Well , I 've personally measured the gravitational pull of a ball of lead about 5cm in diameter . Are you suggesting that angels push the planets around ? That was the leading theory before Newton .
Then Exodus says the following :
Huh ?
Well , of course the issue is n't `` limiting '' marriage , but rather making it more open-ended . But again , either way , it 'll be a moot point before too long .
All concepts of right and wrong are subjective . It is that atheists and agnostics are more honest about it .
Ever heard of gravitational lensing ? It was the FIRST test of general relavtivity back in 1919. http : //archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia ... steinTest.html
Yes , that 's true . If the majority places discriminations in place and the Court is bound to enforce the law as written , then the Court is bound to enforce that discrimination . That is democracy , and that is the rule of law . If we choose to undermine that democracy , which we have done , we have to be very careful where that leads . What we end up with is less and less of a representative democracy . Who has the power at the end of it ? Certainly not `` the people '' .
What ? ! Then how do we discount the Gospel of Thomas or any of the gnostic gospels ? How are they wrong and the canonical gospels true ? If historians held the `` it does not matter what the document contains '' standard , there 'd be no knowing anything .
Cherry picking again .
Well , my point is that they ( I , you , or any collector ) should n't be forced but rather , that it is a smart thing to do in order to make sure you are not selling a firearm to a felon ( which could land you in prison ) .
Well we are waiting for the answer Mr.Brady , how say you ? would you think differently ? or are you gon na dodge Ethmi 's hypothetical question , which is by the way a damned good one .
Why should they kill a human being in the womb , whether this human being is Arab or not ? Are n't the Arab and non-Arab created by God ? Why all this discrimination among the creation of God ? eanassir
I think the main pro-life argument from the libertarian camp is that pro-life laws are a form of `` negative intrusion , '' just like laws against murder , rape or theft . Libertarian ideology centers around a belief in negative government - a government that can effectively protect its citizens from rapists , murderers , thieves , etc . They oppose both positive government ( i.e . totalitarianism ) and anarchy . Granted , I am not certain if anti-abortion laws are truly negative intrusion . These Libertarians for Life seem to have it figured out , but I am not sure if anti-abortion laws are positive or negative intrusion .
Could you please cite where you are getting this biological definition of evolution ?
I believe the Congress in Mass is still fighting what their Supreme Court did and I am pretty sure they will be trying to pass and amendment there in the next year ... ... ... .. It will be very interesting to see what happens ... ... ... ... ..
Of course the bolshevik revolution was doomed from the start as Russia was not indsutrialised and the revolution was imposed by a minority of the bourgeoisie rather than a mass movement of the proletariat ( not that there was a proletariat in Russia at the time ) .
Here you are making an entirely unsooprted assumption , that I see myself as better than everybody else or that I am somehow smug in my views . I am no better or worse than most . We are all just the same tailess monkeys that walked out of the jungle so many millions of years ago . we are not particularly enlightenend , nor are we likely to become so .
I am refering to the YEC position when I use the term `` creation '' .
And since this is inarguable , empirical fact , we 're fairly safe in saying so
I 've heard a lot of naive stuff before , but that 's a new one . I do n't think I 've ever heard anything more simpleminded in nature . With your own government dictating that you ca n't inflict injury on those that would hurt you , they 're not acting in your best interest . Nor are they when the police are tasked with making sure your windows and doors are locked up tight at night .
Say that again ? Mayor Nagin was the one who gave the order for all weapons to be seized , Bush had absolutely nothing to do with it . President Bush even signed into federal law the bill that would prevent such an occurrence from ever happening again , by making it a crime for any government organization to seize firearms during a declared state of emergency . Try again , Simone .
Hey , as Collin said , P.Z . registered , and got it . I would say that booting him out is the height of hypocrisy . It confirms to be that it is based on a lie , and the producer knows it . The movie was making a claim that the 'opposition ' was silencing I.D. , and the presentation of alternate ideas . Yet , what do they do ? They kicked someone out they INTERVIEWED for the movie ( based on false pretenses to be sure , but they did pay him for appearing in the movie ) . That sounds that THEY are the ones trying to suppress opposing ideas , not science . Yes , they had the legal right . But , boy did it put egg on their face , considering everything . It shows them to be hypocrites and liars .
Thousands of fertilized eggs .
You do n't even take into consideration the possibility that Japan could have a higher mass murder rate- perhaps the same as the US- if guns were freely available in that country . You have a lot of explaining to do if you expect me to buy what you 're trying to peddle .
I think you are on to something . The problem I see is that any proponent of a plan such as this will have toi take on both the health insurance lobby and the pharma lobby and their bottomless well of $ $ $ and propaganda . Here 's hoping now that there 's a new sheriff in town .
Yes . We all ask this question of creationists who propose that the universe was created out of nothing - poof ! But science does n't try to answer that question . We do know that the universe began expanding about 13.7 billion years ago . What went before that and the cause for the expansion is n't known and at present , and may never be knowable . However , we do know that particles can and do spring into existence from nothing , for no apparent reason . Google `` Casimir effect '' and read about one example . Wikipedia will probably be the 3rd entry . This something from nothing is an effect from the zero-point energy of a vacuum .
That 's EXACTLY the point . Regardless of whether or not human minds think differently , whichever mind produced and agrees that 2+2=4 is absolutely correct , the rest are wrong . We know this because we can observe and test the concept in the physical world and prove that it is true . This goes for just about anything , dissention in the face of facts does not change the facts . IMHO , this invalidates your claim that something produced in the human mind is not absolute due to some human minds being contradictory .
Actually , the answer might depend more on the nature of the question , or the particular religious cult of the person being asked , etc . In questions of science , fundamentalists will tell you that the answer was revealed to them by their god in their holy scripture . On the other hand , you are characterizing religion as insanity . I think that you really mean that when religion is offered as science , then that is insane .

Oh , let 's see . How about the fact that both ideas rely on some magical invisible being that brought everything about by some unspecified means . What is funny is that for public consumption ID claims that the identity of the designer is unknown ( wink , wink ) . However , as is stated in the Discovery Institute 's private Wedge document , one of the goals of ID creationism is : `` To replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and hurnan [ sic ] beings are created by God . '' That sounds like creationism to me .
Because the correct alternative to the best naturalistic explanation scientists have come up with so far may well be an even better naturalistic explanation , not divine intervention .
Ludacris and many others in the hip hop scene disrespect women with their lyrics and videos . Much of what hip hop puts out contributes to unwanted pregnancies .
Perhaps what is confusing is inaccurate reference to peoples fields of expertise .
You can forget the loaded language including false notions of progress . Lifeforms are evolving by way of purely physical and chemical mechanisms .
WHAT QUOTES ? ? ? That 's what I was asking you to repost because I ca n't find anything intelligent you have either posted or quoted at all !
Yes , but by that logic ( mine ) , that is true . Do n't attempt to accept my first statement without accepting my second . They use the same logic .
Because of that one omitted phrase ?
You have conviced no one or even come remotely to forming an argument .
What do I have against abortion ? Hmmm , let me think . I guess there is that little fact that it is MURDER ! But besides that `` opinion '' , it does effect me because it effects society in a negative way . Do you just choose to ignore the studies on the terrible emotional and physical problems women have after they have abortions ? Look here to see what I mean . Do a search for `` effects of abortion '' on the Web and see if you do n't find many more studies with the same results . I could have posted many more links . Maybe you do n't know about these studies since the leftist media and women 's groups tends to ignore them . Maybe you just ignore them because they do n't fit into your world view . Either way , the facts are there .
Well , it HAD to . How else did it get here ? Even in the genesis myth , life came from non-life .
Yes .
Because that is your only excuse ? Sorry chum , you still do n't get seperation of church and state . If you want to debate religion , take it to the religion forum .
Oh really ? And who are these people ? Point them out to us .
You just proved the DETERANCE of a gun on crime , The deterance of SOME people Carriing concealed ... Just like your poor mans sign . Do you get it ? Yes we agree on the last point but that is done by the people who choose to carry that makes criminals think twice about attacking you ... He does not know if you are armed or not . BTW hows your brother ? You gettin that all fixed ? I only ask as this is a most serious subject you brought up and I am truly concerned for you and your families well being .
but there is no federal law that says children cant tote around guns their parents own how many times do I have to explain it you
Not having knowledge of an unknown says nothing about it 's existence . I am thankful ( to God ) that neither you nor I make the rules . ... God be with you .
Again , modern birds seem to do fine as do gliding mammals such as flying squirrels .
Well , the question I am asking is for you to provide a valid scientific prediction based on creationism .
No . It steps firmly in the realm of REALITY Jyoshu . Have you never heard people talk about how police in an area respond in X amount of time for one situation , but for a different situation , like in a neighborhood predominantly black or gay or ___ , the response time is four times as long ? Have you never heard of how there have been cases where people have died because they tried to get medical help at the `` white '' hospital ? Or how about you read about THIS case and tell me that these concerns are n't real ...
So everyone thinks that `` evolutionists '' should seize power or something ? If that is true , it is because evolution is very widely accepted .
Uh , how ?
That 's your answer is it : you believe your god just bodged together life in a convenient fashion rather than doing a proper job ? What a lazy-arsed god you believe in .
I do n't think I said they 'd be paid badly . ... and you say `` this country '' as if you 're here in the USA . Are you in the UK or not ? I noticed you did not provide a link to your claim of doctors pay in the UK ... .so I looked it up . It is hard to conceive of an average being higher than any one of the samples and the highest paid in the UK appear to be 20 year veterans making GBP79,500 ... .. updated 4/1/2008 ( That 's today and I doubt it 's an April Fool joke . ) http : //www.payscale.com/research/Uk/ ... Doctors/Salary Do you have another source that justifies your exageration ? I do notice in the third bar chart down the page that UK Physicians IN PRIVATE PRACTICE make GBP100,000 . It appears that the Government Doctors make a lot less ( GBP42,500 for state and local ... GBP54,000 for federal . ) Where is your back-up ?
So we kill the baby instead ? Interesting idea . How about instead we reform the fostor and adoption care system . No , people ar n't looking for healthy , white infants , they are looking for infants . This automatically reduces 90 % of adoption cases . The so called `` Healthy white infants '' make up 70 % of all adoption cases , seeing that 30 % of abortion are done by blacks , and latinos and most minorities do n't have abortions , but instead keep their children .
Well , they are in the minority no matter what .

Because of your question `` What is your definition of pure '' , I now know how to make soap . I 'll never stink again ! ! ! And I think homeopathic medicine is all about using things like vitamin c to prevent colds , and making sure you ingest lots of calcium if you are worried about ostioperosis . Ya know stuff that makes sense .
btw , i 'm 17 ... well , 18 ... ( almost yay ! ) bullsh*t. you do get critized for tlaking about god ... any other god other than the christian god that is .
Well , at least you have that right . The cheapest and most efficient way of delivering health care is through single payer financed by taxes . Every single study ever done demonstrates that the most efficiently run health care system is Medicare . It functions with a 2 % overhead . As I hope you know , insurance is based on the principal of risk-spreading , and the larger the pool the more the risk is spread . Even now , if you are healthy and privately `` insured '' you are paying for others ' health care . You pay premiums and the benefits go to those who are in need of benefits . The only difference is that you support all the clones and drones in the health care `` industry '' who come between the physician and the delivery of services . Like so many on the so-called libertarian right , you have made a fetish of the market . Keep on drinking the Kool-Aid that Alyssa Rosenblum dispenses in trash like The Fountainhead
Yes and no . Metaphorical creationism ca n't be disproved period as there are no hard facts to disprove . Literal creationism can be disproven on a number of factors , from the timeline , to events such as the flood .

Are you implying that an entity with reproductive organs can not be holy ? Are you implying that reproduction in itself is not a holy process ?
Hi Joe , welcome to the forum . I must warn you though that you have argued so perfectly and similarly all of the points I just argued on another thread about abortion , that some people around here might just accuse you of being me with a new handle . No problem though , I hope you have better luck than I did .

Well , in that case I would go for the US government any day . Soviet russia was so far removed from the communist ideals of equality as contemporary Russia . Power , wealth and influence was concentrated in a precious elite ... In fact , it`s probably the same elite that rules Russia today . I can`t think of any Soviet benefits over US-style democracy , apart from the societ educational system ( but that`s not even entirely a political issue ) .
Um ... , Thank you ? Im assuming thats not sarcasm , right ?
It is DNA which makes one a human , it is the mind which makes one a human being , a person .
Read the post , IF I can do A , then I am allowed to do B. I can not keep morphine responsibily , then I can not own morphine . I can keep assault rifles responsibily , then I am allowed to own assault rifles . That is a hallmark of our law system , personal responsibility . I do things that I can carry out with saftey and responsibility . I can not carry out heart surgery with saftey and responsibility , I am not allowed to perform heart surgery . But ... I can keep assault weapons with saftey and responsibility . I train more than often than 90 % of soliders with my rifle . I am at the rifle range every weekend . I a better marksman than most soliders , only special forces put more rounds down range than I do . I keep my weapons in a steel safe that only explosives will open and you will need a forklift to carry away . The army just keeps them in a building and sometimes in a wooden box . I believe I use more care and responsibility than the army to keep my weapons safe .
Actually , this data point is perfectly meaningless . NONE of the other information ( or the conclusions ) presented in this talk require `` 26 '' . If we made it 260 , does it change ANY of the other conclusions ? No . A failure to recognize non-sequitur data tidbits is usually indicative of an argument that includes other errors .
No , God did n't say this BUT thanks for responding to a post that is over 5 years old .
He 's almost out , folks !
You started off with criticizing gun banning , but now you seem to be criticizing tough punishments for criminals . A May 2006 article in the Cape Times said that `` National law currently provides for a sentence of 25 years for illegal firearm possession . '' http : //www.capetimes.co.za/index.php ... icleId=3230121 So if the death penalty is the punishment for illegal gun possession then I suppose the law must have changed recently . I wonder if the people who claim that we do n't need more gun laws but just tougher punishments for people who break current gun laws would support such a penalty .
well i know that they never coexisted but the fallout lasted a long time and i think humans could survive because we can eat such a lage varity of food humans seem to be able to live almost everware
What he was saying is that he needed to make a helper for man . Not that he needed to make animals and then search through them for a helper . He already had made them . He looked for a helper but could not find one . ( This stuff would be so much easier to explain in person . )
That is merely your interpretation of my actions here , and does not reflect my personal motivations . You do n't like it that I disagree with you , and from the options available to explain that disagreement you alternately choose 'Peeling is stupid/simple minded ' and 'Peeling is driven by an emotional , philosophical imperative ' - the former because it 's always a handy and ego-inflating explanation for disagreement and you do n't have any respect for other people 's intellect anyway , and the latter because it 's understandable and familiar to you . I disagree with you because the logic you have used to prop up your assertion that your philosophy mirrors reality is clearly faulty . The evidence you provide to support your case actively harms it . It 's not that you 're certainly wrong , just that you do n't have to be right for the evidence we see to add up . I do n't think you 're stupid by any means ; the skill with which you have manipulated our discussions has been considerable . I do think you are ignorant of much that would beneficially inform your hypotheses , that you cherry-pick just that evidence which seems to support your preconceptions rather than critically applying your hypothesis to all the available evidence , and I do think that your intellect is being leveraged in pursuit of the wrong goal , namely the creation of a fortress of semantics , idiosyncratic terminology and untestable assertions from within which you can hurl abuse at others . You may disagree with my assessment - fine . I am at least doing you the courtesy of believing you when you say you formulate EAM with the express intention of promoting your personal philosophical views about life .
I can not remember the latest figures , but the Earth is around 4.5 billion years old and the universe is around 13 billion years old I think .
http : //www.religioustolerance.org/ev_state.htm ( there is a lot at the above site that I do n't agree with - I use it because I feel that the best place to get an undisputed description OF the opposition is FROM the opposition ) Studies of the origin of the first life form , the origin of the earth , and the origin of the universe DO form a large part of intelligent design . Of the several `` different scientific diciplines '' refered to above , they all have one thing in common since there is only one basic alternative to intelligent design , and that 's undirected , random , happenstance processes . For purposes of this debate , can we come up with one general two word phrase for the `` different scientific diciplines '' - a phrase perfectly comparable to intelligent design , which `` theory of evolution '' is clearly not ? How about `` happenstance origins '' ? Since you declare that intelligent design is not science , you have to have a criteria for science that intelligent design does n't fit . Does `` happenstance origins '' fit the same criteria ? If there is no way to test or falsify intelligent design , there is no way to test or falsify happenstance origins . If intelligent design is n't repeatable , happenstance origins are n't repeatable . Other scientists ca n't apply a scientific method to happenstance origins to get the same kind of results as the original scientist , and on and on . Evolutionists imply that with time , they may be able to scientifically get to the bottom of happenstance origins . That 's no more ( or less ) plausible than intelligent design advocates claim to be able to scientifically get to the bottom of intelligent design . If you demand to know how we can prove intelligent design is false or true before we consider it as science , why ca n't the same be asked of you before you consider the progressive steps of happenstance origins to be science ? I 've never been to college , but here are some comments from someone who has , on the definition of science ; Stephen Grocott
It 's not that we pro life people do n't care about womens rights it 's that we care about the babies rights too . They wo n't do abortion after the 3rd month right ? Well the baby is living , it has a heartbeat , it has nerves , eyes , and all that . I think it is sickening when people say that the baby or fetus whatever you want to call it does n't feel anything . Everyone always says `` what if they get raped ? Would you have the baby ? '' Well for one only 1 % of abortions are done because of rape . Secondly if you are raped you can go to the hospital and tell them what happened and they will do an emergency IUD . Why does the women get to choose who can come into the world ? They are going to kill it and they do n't care . You never knew what the baby could have been . They could have been the one to find the cure to cancer , aids , or another uncurable disease . Your not giving the baby a chance and that is wrong and not fair . Thats my opinion .
Religion influences all laws . Without that influence , there would be no laws . Note : humanism is also a religion !
And you do not have an agenda ... oh and we should be more like the Canadiens ? Why does n't Canada fund a militrary ? And what do they do with that 80 % tax rate ... obnoxious ... ...
The stem cells that are used for such potentially life-saving procedures are at such an extremely early stage of development that there is no biological possibility that the beginnings of a mind exist . There is absolutely no feeling , no emotion , no thought , no sense of pain . The batch of cells is still an object . They are the very beginnings of the body where the beginnings of the mind ( or , for that matter , a soul , if one is of the opinion that a soul must include some sense of mind ) are very far off . However , unless I am mistaken in the biology of this particular batch of cells , they could potentially develop into an actual person ( where , for me , person means not only body but some sense of mind or soul as well ) . This sense of potential personhood should not be taken lightly . This would not be a case of a woman 's right over her own body . This would be the case of deliberately generating living human cells ( note : this is not equal to a living person ) for medical reasons benefiting a living person . In the balance of having some respect for the idea that these cells could potentially become a person ( again , still far off from being actual people - i.e . starting to have a mind ) , I would only condone using such stem cells if it is a case of saving the life of an existing person - be it myself or anyone else . I would not , for example , condone use of stem cells to help alleviate a medical condition which is not life threatening .
Let 's try to use a little kindness and common sense and not tell people on a public forum to `` shut ur mouth '' . Read the forum rules , they might help your focus . -Mach
Your argument , I believe . The one I said does n't hold water . It appears to claim that the placing of restrictions upon items specifically designed for the killing of other human beings is somehow comparable to and a prelude for the banning of everyday items whose intended use is in no way connected to harm of others . Your title then equates this with a step towards a form of government in which one person is afforded executive , legislative and judiciary power over the country they control .
Not `` genetically '' ; `` statistically '' is more accurate . Yes , even some people are statistically less likely to breed . There are currently many solutions to problems which would usually be disabling to people , but selection is evident in countries without those solutions .
I 'm sure there certainly ARE pro-lifers out there who are against the Iraqi war . Anti-war people come from all walks of life .
We do . We do n't even teach the conjecture . And we do n't teach superstition . That 's why creationism is n't taught .
No , Mega posted a long editorial from the guardian which was written after the police arrested the owner of a conversion factory . It 's interesting that they claim the gun crimes stats have gone up , when all the sources I 've seen show that violent gun crime has gone down . That 's the guardian for you . It does n't show that we have high crime rates whichever stats you accept .
The sentence that I have underlined above is a falsity in Warren 's argument . There is a distinction between using property to kill someone , and failing to use property to sustain someone . For example : 1 ) Joe shoots Bob with a shotgun . That is murder . 2 ) Bob is hungry , and Joe does n't give him any food , so Bob starves to death . That is not murder - it is death by natural causes . Why is 2 ) not murder ? Because hunger killed Bob , and nobody owns hunger . I think we can apply the same standards to abortions .
There is quite a bit of debate what the militia can be interpreted as , and individuals ignoring the laws as they see fit is anarchy ( checked out the Free State project , you are a beleiver in Arnacho-captalism or so it seems which is a form of anarchy ) , nothing nessesarily wrong with it though . Understood the point it was making , just the logic is flawed . The fact the city had to disobey state laws is a good example of the lunatic right , though this is n't really the issue here .
And the scientific papers do n't . The problem here is that creationists do n't read the scientific papers . In fact , most ca n't even understand them .
And then you can go pat yourself on the back and pretend it 's all better . I hope your personal comfort level will be worth the havoc that will be brought upon the lives of women .
H.CHRIST on a skateboard Comrade , why do n't you just take it for what its worth ?
But my relationship is between a man and woman . You would be asking marriage to be redefined to do that . Remember , part of what defines marriage is that it is between a man and woman .
If I argue that all babies should be killed , and you do n't think all babies should be killed , does that mean that all babies are n't really babies ? No , it means that you think my reasoning is unjustified . Think about that for a second , then re-read the claim .
Indeed true . God created man in his own likeness and man returned the favor . Man created a vindictive , vengeful , and vicious god , according to the Bible . So where does a loving god come from ?
So 1052 voters is a majority of california voters ? And I know what the article say 's , but no where did it actually say it was from a diverse sampling from across the State so forgive my suspicions , but I just do n't trust the gay lobby to be honest or ethical about anything they do .

First , you would n't use a handgun against an F-16 fighter plane . It 's stupid and useless , but there are a lot of ingenious people out there that can probably prop up something to shoot one down , that 's for sure . The second amendment is about self defense regardless of how big or small the threat is . I would think you would appreciate the ban on machine guns , since they are acknowledging that there is line to draw when it comes to it ( like you ca n't own a fighter jet with military armament and just like the 1st Amendment you ca n't yell fire in a crowd . ) Is n't this what most `` living document '' people say ? Oh , I get it now ? It 's not about that is it ? The fact of the matter is , you are dissatisfied that the line was n't drawn to limit even more of it , i.e . a complete ban on firearms , only the national guard or armed forces should have them . Sorry , but if you were to do that , it would open up another can of worms in which would mean that all other confirmed rights could be limited even more . The SCOTUS did the right thing in this instance because they acknowledged there is a line to be drawn , but not the one that prohibits all law abiding citizens from owning firearm .
The problem with happenstance origins is that there is no evidence , and it 's simply not possible to falsify it . If we were able to prove so many scientific proceedures ( from abiogenesis to radiometric dating - all based on the presupposition that there is no God ) were indisputably true , then ID would be falsified . There is not enough supporting evidence for happenstance origins . Yet so much of happenstance origins is considered science , so all too often , there is no line between religion and science .
If freeing slaves meant that the former slaves could live of other 's organs without their desire or consent , putting their health and possibly life at risk ... while at the same time having no perception of self , no brain , no mind , no consciousness ... I would side with the slaveowners . Once anothers right to live becomes greater than my right to my own body , I become the slave .
It may not be what I think ( after all , so-called `` intelligent '' designs really are n't very intelligent ) , but it 's exactly what I think it is : total garbage based upon religion shrouded in wannabe science .
Ca n't you read ?
Just think , without Christianity and its preservation of science during the Dark Ages , we lost out on the opportunity to reinvent the wheel . That has got to go down as one of the dumbest things that I 've ever read on this forum .
The man has no say so whatsoever .
I see . So you must be a female to know for a fact that this is false . Actually I 'm not interested in that kind of science and I do n't care . I have n't seen the papers but I suspect the book was written for mercenary reasons . What does that have to do with cosmology , physics , astrophysics , geology , molecular biology , genetics and on and on ? Someone mentioned that you seem to mistrust science and it seems that you do .
You know , I 'm all for punny jokes ( even moreso than most people ) , but that 's not what I meant . I seriously want a designist explanation for the development , as opposed to the Hovindian `` it is an anchor point for muscles '' explanation of its existence . ( Although , it 's not as if we do n't have any examples that do n't have that `` problem . '' )
Interesting that Jesus does not say , `` This do , only after you have determined whether or not I am an illegal , or whether or not the reason why I am homeless is a reason that satisfied you . I am sorry that someone near to you was attacked . I do not believe that the attack occurred simply because the attacker was illegal . As a matter of fact , all such attacks are illegal , unlawful , whether perpetrated by an `` illegal '' or anyone else . I hope that the attacker was brought to justice and punished .
This is a separate issue , Voice of Reason . Some did n't understand how pro-choice people can say they personally would n't do something and/or think something is wrong but still support other 's right to do it , and that 's what I was answering .
It may only be salvaging to you but to the parents involved it is body theft . Let me just ask you to step in our shoes for just 10 minutes imagine trawling around 100 's of hospital labs and medical schools seeing all these poor little babies lined up in jars and i do n't mean just a few there is up to 50 in each hospital and school imagine looking at those jars hoping that one of them is your child so you can at lastgive him the burial he/she deserves ( a basic human right ) yet at the same time praying that none of them are yours . Having done that can you still say that it is only salvage bearing in mind our children were only sent for post mortem and many of us have not seen them since ?
And ?
And if I were to invoke the principle that is often called `` Occam 's Razor '' nowadays ? Does it need to be the same as `` Ockham ? ''
Obviously the correct thing to do is kill the zygote . The thing that bothers me about this whole thing is some of the people that said they would refuse to choose . This is characteristic of your typical wimpy religious copout and is nothing but a cheep avoidance tactic . These people are not the kind of people that should be making any important decisions that concern other people so I guess its just as well . A zygote is no more viable then a sperm . The attempt to call a zygote a living being is simply more evidence that the religious have no common sense .

And so does the Catholic Church ... ... ... They accept the homosexual but still condemn the homosexual act as they would any other sin ... ... .
YOu mean they do n't eat , sleep , pass wastes , fight ( not neccesarily physically ) for dominance in their social setting , react to the opposite sex , put on displays for the opposite sex , and things like that ? How very odd .

I see . You are claiming that this is the case with every single beneficial mutation in every species through all time ? If that is not what you are saying , then what is your point ? Suppose what you say is true half the time . Then the gene gets passed on half the time . And what if the mutation occurs in the larger male ?
lets see im going to ask you some questions . are you ? are you a ? do you have blue eyes ? do you have brown eyes ? now if you say NO to one of those things isnt that cosidered an answer ? where i come from its yes or no.2 possible answers . not just yes every time to get what you want .
sonar is more than that ; it 's a method of communication . http : //dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20041025/bat.html Whenever females heard sonar sounds from another female , they would call less frequently , likely to tune in to what the other female was communicating . According to the researchers , female bats interact mainly with other females in complex hierarchies during their lives , so that could be why they take more of an interest in echolocation sounds from their own sex . ... ..She told Discovery News , `` The connection of the two studies is in the idea that bat communication is more complex than previously documented , since research is finding a variety of social calls to be communicating territory defense and mate attraction , as well as sonar calls , previously thought to only function in prey capture and navigation , to also have a communication role .

There is little confidence in the system as it presently exists . That 's why people want a public option included , or to scrap the entire bill for real reform like single payer . American health insurance , as a system , is not designed to provide assurance of health care , and when we need it most .
I 'm still having a hard time with this . If nothing exists , no matter , then how can `` the number one '' exist ? On what basis is it defined ? If there is only nothing , then you ca n't add to it , like I said 0+0=0 . I know this is getting slightly off topic and philosophical , but it would seem to me that `` concepts '' , and I 'm not sure exactly how that 's being defined , must have a basis in reality , and therefore in matter .
most straight people get marry intending to have kids .
I think I 've been remarkably patient so far , actually . I made a simple personal statement to qualify my opinions , and you have decided that I 'm lying or deluded because that better fits the image of 'darwinists ' you like to think you 're debating . I 've endured with very little complaint regular comments deriding my intellect , and even kept my temper when hours of painstakingly constructed logical argument and evidence is completely ignored or dismissed as 'blowing smoke ' because you ca n't come up with a better response . The idea that I 'm the one somehow teetering on the brink of civilised debate , and should mend my ways lest I topple into your personal oubliette ... I think you need a quick perspective and soda .
You hear that cry ... allowing gays to marry will cause the downfall of civilization ... but you never hear `` how '' or `` why '' ? More Chicken Little # # # # .
If we bankrupt the country , the war on terror wo n't be the reason . Wasteful domestic spending is the only reason we have trouble funding the war on terror . We need to get intellegent with domestic spending . We could start with the $ 7 billion EPA .
Actually , the more educated a person is , the less likely he is to be a creationist . Creationists tend to be semi-literate ( poorly educated ) , rural , poor , and female .
It is not only supposedly `` junk DNA '' that was used for these kind of arguments . The vertebrate eye has been preached to be a bad design . Why ? Why is it a bad design ? The human eye contain bona fide optical fibers to conduct light ( nice illustration ) . Besides the design arose 40-60 times during evolution , like evolution was biased ( converged on an optimal design ) towards such a structure . So why is it sub optimal ? Are proponents of these arguments going to suggest a better design with all the blueprints ? Thought not , arguments from ignorance are short on design . Why was it suggested that the appendix is useless and functionless , instead of just admitting `` we are still looking into it '' . A few articles discussing its function : 1 ) Dasso JF . Howell MD . 1997 . `` Neonatal appendectomy impairs mucosal immunity in rabbits . '' Cellular Immunology . 182 ( 1 ) :29-37 . 2 ) Dasso JF . Obiakor H. Bach H. Anderson AO . Mage RG . 2000 . `` A morphological and immunohistological study of the human and rabbit appendix for comparison with the avian bursa . '' Developmental & amp ; Comparative Immunology . 24:8:797-814 . 3 ) Fisher , RE . 2000 . `` The primate appendix : a reassessment . '' The Anatomical Record ( New Anatomist ) 261:228-236 . 4 ) Weinstein PD . Mage RG . Anderson AO . 1994 . `` The appendix functions as a mammalian bursal equivalent in the developing rabbit . '' Advances in Experimental Medicine & amp ; Biology . 355:249-53 . 5 ) A more detailed survey of the evidence , with numerous references to other technical literature , showing that the appendix is not a vestigial organ can be found in J.W . Glover , The Human Vermiform Appendixa General Surgeons Reflections , CEN Technical Journal , 3:3138 , 1988 . In short : The appendix contains a high concentration of very specialized structures called lymphoid follicles ( also found throughout the GIT ) . Lymphoid follicles in the appendix produce cells that produce antibodies that control which essential bacteria come to reside in the caecum and colon in neonatal life . The `` strategic '' placement of the appendix is important during the development of neonatal life in the setup of healthy intestinal flora therefore neonatal appendectomy will impair mucosal immunity . `` The appendix 's job is to reboot the digestive system ... '' and `` acts as a good safe house for bacteria , '' . It might not be that important in later life and it can be removed , but so can your one kidney , your stomach , an eye , small intestines , reproductive organs etc . Are these bad designs then as well ? See ... these arguments have no force . Empty arguments from ignorance ... And the cilium ? Until the 1990s , the prevailing view of the primary cilium was that it was merely a vestigial organelle , without important function ( wiki ) . Seems like pretty high-tech structures to me ? Primary Cilium As Cellular 'GPS System ' Crucial To Wound Repair
... which -- although a very good point when it comes to refuting creationist claptrap -- is not even the major issue of this forum . Undesirable consequences of an effect do not make that effect false or nonexistent . Gravity `` breeds '' falling deaths , which are bad , so let 's maintain that gravity does n't exist ...
I know the Pygmies live in Rain Forests now but these evolutions took place , according to you more than a hundred thousand years ago at the very least when the Weather patterns were completely different in Africa and everywhere for that matter . In addition , the OP states 5 genetic clusters based on 5 geographical Continents , that allows one for Africa , yet from that single cluster we get the shortest people on Earth and some of the tallest . Does n't that cause you to question the reasonableness of this so called theory at all ? Or do you just blindly accept it because it comes to you in the guise of science ? And if it 's science then it must be right , right ?
And the only reason the criminals hold handguns is because of the ban .
You must be thinking of physics ... last I looked , biologists were n't trying to explain the the creation of the universe . However , we have an excellent handle on the evolution of species , and some pretty reasonable ideas about the origin of life , which is more than your bible ever came up with . I mean ... some invisible , bearded guy-in-the-sky zapped it all into existence ? Fairytales .
Oh , and good to see you here ! I notice we got some new posters and greetings to all .
That 's right ! Everyone of the fundamentalists are on the band wagon about abortion being murder . The same ones depend on their ministers to hail the words for the biblical scholars . I think it 's called Hypocrisy at its finest ! Some people wo n't read for themselves but condem others who do .
If you wrote this in response to my post , please note that I said that there is no PHYSICAL evidence that suggests that God exists without the mindset that God exists . Individuals who believe that God exists do not constitute physical evidence of God 's existence . Their belief in God is the reason for their seemingly amazing actions . Their belief is in their mind ( and/or their 'spirit ' ) . It is based on faith . It is not based on physical evidence in reality . The Bible is a book . It was written by human beings ( allegedly inspired by God ) . What is written in the Bible are ideas that were in existence prior to being written down , or they could not have been written down . If there is a central theme of ideas for a segment of the population over a long period of time , the population will be able to continue to write of those similar ideas with great consistency . That still does not constitute physical evidence in reality that God exists . That is just evidence that a similar belief in God has existed over a 'long ' period of time by a segment of the population .
Now you 're being ridiculous . The big bang is not the evolution of the universe . The words `` evolution of the universe '' do not necessarily entail the big bang . For example , brane theory offers an alternative theory to explain the evolution of the universe . But claiming that the `` evolution of the universe '' is part of the theory of evolution is somewhat like claiming that because Kate Hudson has achieved stardom , she is producing vast amounts of energy through hydrogen fusion . Why is it that creationists believe that every word has only a single meaning ? By the way , I have always heard the creationist invention `` GTE '' referred to as the General Theory of Evolution - you know , as if there is some relation to the general theory of relativity .
Just because they undergo training and testing does n't mean that they 're any better of a choice than regular people . Police have been caught knowingly selling guns to known criminals , and they 've even shot each other multiple times . The police are n't the equivalent of Jedi , they do n't deserve sole access to firearms just because they get training in the use of arms .
Could you be more specific ?
Really ? Let 's go to the OP . You said `` What this post explains is that Occams razor denies the accuracy of the bible because it makes too many assumptions to be more likely than the scientific explanation . Therefore , it is poor logic to accept the bible without further evidence . '' Now , if we are not `` to accept the bible '' , what are we supposed to do ? `` See my first example for a reason that we should keep our beliefs uncomplicated whenever possible . If we didnt , we would be swamped with thousands of explanations for very simple events , and most of the explanations would be illogical . '' What do you mean by `` illogical '' . In context it seems that you are saying `` wrong '' . Are you ? If not , specify in detail how do you think an `` illogical '' belief would be correct ? `` Except that Occam 's razor is used for comparing hypotheses. `` Back to a scientific use of parsimony . What are we comparing them for ? `` Most likely '' or for which hypothesis is true and which is false ? I submit that you are being disingenuous . You actually mean that you can use parsimony to decide which hypothesis is true , but , when pressed that this does n't work , fall back to `` most likely '' . So let me ask , how `` most likely '' ? What are the odds ? How do you compute them ? Is `` most likely '' 51 % ot 49 % or 100 % to 0 % or somewhere in between ? Or does it change for each situation ? If `` most likely '' changes , then how do we know what you actually mean ?
Well I 'm not arguing that this is adaptation ... I have never said that.. What I am saying is the environment -- in this case diet is the cause for these traits to emerge in offspring ... ..but like I said earlier ToE does not admit that the diet or any enviornmental variable can influence traits in offspring . Traits are dictated by genes and genes are closed off from the enviornment . This is the basic dogma of Weismann 's barrier . I 'm not necessarily calling this evolution ... .I 'm just simply pointing out that acquired traits can be inherited . There is no other way to describe this other than Lamarckism . Do you disagree that The inheritance of acquired characteristics is simply changes in physiology acquired over the life of an organism that are transmitted to offspring ?
Nope . AIG is n't a museum since there is nothing there of lasting interest or value .
Well , there is now string theory , which has grown into M-theory , which may have a rational answer ( at least a mathematical one ) . But calling it a theory is really a misnomer . It 's more like a hypothetical model .
I do n't find it surprising . It 's probably a strategic sacrifice on their part rather than a change in their personal views . They do n't want to lose votes and possible support from gun owners for their priorities like health care reform because of a difference of opinion on gun control policy . They know that the Republicans are going to hit them with everything they 've got during election time and exaggerated accusations about the Democrats wanting to take away people 's guns would hurt them . The Republicans learned during the Clinton years that creating as much as paranoia as possible about the Democrats supporting big government is the way to regain a majority in Congress . It 's all politics .
This should read : The theory of evolution as it applies to life on earth : Essentially that the various living things on the earth are a product of purely physical/natural laws , which can be rationally explained by one process only I add this because your theory of evolution , which you just posit as here as the only theory , is but one of many .
Because there is no evidence against the virgin birth and there is considerable evidence against Adam -- including the text of Genesis 1 .
I believe science can indeed tell us when it can not be considered a `` person '' as we define a person legally . No mental existence for the simple reason that the hardware has yet to form . Protecting `` potential '' persons is beyond the scope of our Constitution IMO .
You got ta wonder . He keeps saying he 's won but he constantly ignores people calling his bluffs . I 'm not sure whether to laugh or cry at a guy who think 's he 's so smart when he ca n't even understand what erosion is and takes the commercial art of villagers as proof of creation .
But not all `` designs '' are manufactured . Take the repetitive ridges of sand on a beach . They are created by the motion of the water . Shall I remind you of the humorous story about the `` image of Jesus '' that attracted much attention , yet turned out to be a coincidence of shadows ? This is why I insist upon your defining the terms you 're using .
And 2 men ca n't have a perfectly healthy , loving , stable marriage ? Why not ? Honey , every country collapses eventually . It 's a cycle . An empire rises , reaches it 's peak , and falls . Every single one . Take a history class . The government somehow is supposed to protect marriage ... .by saying it 's illegal ? What ? Former homosexual = celibate faker ! Or suicidal self-hater . Or bi that just ignores one half of their feelings . That 's about it .

Many of the animals were young so they weighed less than full grown animals , they did n't get pregnant and make more animals during the journey and they consumed less food because of their size . I 'm surprised you did n't know that Mutz .
Well torturing small animals and lighting fires and now you say you 'd never hurt a child . Why do I and perhaps others fail to believe you ? Gee Brady you are confused . Is it that reading comprehension thing again ? One needs only one post to prove you wrong but I 've posted so many sans insult you are pushing Pinhead out as the comic relief . What was you said , I tortured small animals ? I torture pro slavers as Tither points out . Face to face I merely point out the Pennsylvania Conbstitution and ask where exactly in there is your puffery ? Did you find any proof Sodini had a CCW permit ? Edgar Snyder is hot on the VPC trail now . Show your cyber courage and engage Bryan . I doubt you will but its so much fun to haunt you with it .
Not sure how this remark defines `` kind , '' but nevertheless I have shown that it is n't true . It is your misunderstanding of the theory .
I would just want the woman to ask that question before she spreads her legs . Dono
So according to one of the people who conducted the study do n't go using their results as a tool for arguing against abortion . One woman I know had an abortion a short time after she was married . I also know she has regrets that she had the procedure . I considered what she had to say about her experience and thought about the 14 year old son she now has . From what she told me , I could plainly see she would never have had her son if she had not had her abortion as her circumstances would have changed beyond recognition . Perhaps she gets depressed about the child she never had because of her abortion . However , her son is a fantastic boy whom she loves very much . So we can not simplify in quite the way you seem to infer that we can .
They were at the recent inauguration of our new mayor . What troubles me is the fact that they enlist their kids in the protests . Funny you can hold up those pictures but would be arrested if they were of naked women .
Actually , matter can be created and destroyed . It is total energy that is conserved . One example is in a nuclear reactor . The mass of the fission products is less than that of the original fuel . Matter has been `` destroyed . '' But ov course , it became a form of energy - eventually electricity . On the other side , virtual particles spring into existance all the time in a vacuum . But the are a particle and an anti-particle and the net energy is zero so energy is conserved . These ideas come from quantum mechanics . A virtual particle is a particle that can never be directly detected , but whose existence does have measurable effects . One of those effects is the Casimir effect . It is an attractive pressure between two flat , parallel metal plates placed very near to each other in a vacuum . The pressure is due to the reduced number of virtual particles between the plates . When the plates are very close , only particles of certain resonant wavelengths can exist between them . Thus , more particles on the outside push the plates together . Stephen Hawking talks a lot about virtual particle pairs in both A Brief History of Time and The Universe in a Nutshell .
Lol but the spent rounds go out the side of the weapon sarge so no hot rounds in the shirt And yeah I 'm left handed but oddly enough right eye dominant . It 's a trick being backwards lol ... .
And that fear could motivate the criminals to be armed themselves- thus putting the public in more danger . Such a fear could start an arms race . Try looking at the big picture .
The Ontological argument ? Seriously ? Those strawmen concerning atheism , question-begging and non-sequiturs were n't too shabby either .
[ note : post deleted ] You appear not to understand the purpose of this thread : to find out what side people are on and why .

Just for the sake of argument , let 's assume evolutionists had trouble explaining away the tongue of the woodpecker . How in any sense is creationism the alternative ? No explanation therefore God . What bloody rubbish . And why do the same people keep posting the same crapola on different sites under different names ? Ah , yes . Created without a brain . The only logical non-evolutionary explanation .
There is no 'maybe ' vote listed . Whahappened ? 'Efficiency ' Profit is what motivates decision-makers in government here .
Now who 's being disengenuous ? When was the last time one of you gays posted a pro-Christian thread ? lYou ONLY post anti-Christian threads , even though Christianity has been responsible for much of the good in the world .
I think you hit it pretty much on the money . Gun control does not cure anger , hate , and violence . Talk about responsibility . Gun grabbers blame you and me and our behavior for the violence in this country . They blame everyone except the one who pulls the trigger and takes human life .
Anti abortion people want to take a womens right to an abortion away period . Would you force someone to get a sonagram of a tumor and be forced to look at it and think `` do I really want to have this tumor removed ? '' That is exactly what a fetus is and for some women that is how it is viewed .
The only reason why that makes no sense is that no one exists inside the embryo . It would be like writing about someone weeding their garden from a weeds point of view . The anthropomorphization of non-mental existant beings is implausible at least .
True so true Now a true judicial activist would rule the unconstitutional the very state amendments that definds marriage between a man and a woman even though they are in the constitution . The laws such as in Mass . and other states that ruled on marriage were gender nutral . If the era http : //www.now.org/issues/economic/eratext.html where in the US constitution then marriage equility could be fought in the courts on that level .
Yes he is telling me : `` This is what I am doing to my dog , and what I have been up to all this time as your president . ''
Thanks for the link it was an interesting read . I found the comment in the second to last paragraph most intriguing : 'Scientists have also identified the smallest number of genes required to sustain life in a bacterial cell ( about 350 ) . If they can overcome the many technical hurdles of building a wholly artificial cell in the lab , it is conceivable they could `` create '' - albeit simple - `` life '' . ' Who knows what that line of research might lead us to ?
If the taser led to the death of an innocent , they would have been charged with a crime . There is no doubt about that once the investigation was completed . But this is all irrelevant since the baby did n't die and was born without complications . This whole thread is founded upon a huge what if in order to demonize pro-lifers while ignoring what the pro-death advocates truly represent as they support infanticide for the sake of the convenience of irresponsible women .
Whcih is why , in order to get to at least some semblance of the truth , one must look behind the report to the publication where is appears . There are very few outside the hard right religious radical lunatic fringe ( SoC for example ) who give credence to anything NARTH puts out given their biases . I have yet to see one of these folks explain how allowing same gender couples to marry will negatively impact their own marriages .
The entire Bible is `` man made '' . When you start believing that parts of the Bible are infallible , where does it end ?
If you havent noticed we also have private education and private healthcare . All states have to provide healthcare if they arent totally heartless , and this is one of the most efficient ways to dispense mass healthcare . The same goes for the education system ...
This is not nearly as uncommon as people seem to think . i am guilty of it myself . My company offers a high end software product and we provide a support forum for users to discuss problems , techniques , etc ... I often log on under a false persona in order to interact with customers without getting swamped . It is no big deal . If anybody asked if our software is good or sucks , I always say it is excellent and easy to use . If they ask about our support , i always tell them `` top notch '' . I have spoken with a couple of college professors I know about this very topic ( I live in a college town ) and they have both said this is far from unusual in the academic community , especially when publishing controversial work .
Again , name one that is presented in high school . In fact , name several since you seem to think that there are several . And it really does n't matter how many times you squeal about how you are n't talking about YEC , you are . You have been duped and you did n't even know it was going on . Why do the people of Kansas elect scientific illiterates to make decisions about science education . Why did they pay a panal of 27 scientists and science educators to write science standards , and then throw them out ?
Oh that greatly changes the equation does n't it ? Very unrealistic , but for the sakes of the debate , why not ? Well , alledgedly , 23 innocent people have been put to death , and for sure two unrefutable cases . I do n't support killing people as a deterrent or as any means in a justice system .
What do you mean by other definitions ? Before you stated `` Creation is ... . '' thus it is implicit in this that you are arguing against a single homogonous construct . And it 's embarrassing for you to realise that there 's actually as much variance of opinion in this , as in evolution .
You seem to like this little blurb , I 've seen it several times in various forms . The last time I saw it , it said something like `` there are no half ape-half human fossils '' . This is a rediculous line of thought , and shows how little you actually know about TOE . A half ape-half human fossil would mean that an ape had reproduced with a human . THAT IS NOT WHAT THE TOE IMPLIES . I do n't know how many more times you need this repeated to you , but I will offer my assistance as often as needed ... no need to thank me .
Private guns were completely private . They were personal property and could not be seized . It was the man that carried the weapon who was required to provide service , and required to provide his own weapon . Since the enrollment and inventory requirements were specifically to ensure that every man had his own private rifle , shot , powder , kit to fight with , it would seem rather stupid to worry that it was infringing on peoples right to bear arms , would n't it ? Contrast this with today , where registration schemes have been used in places like new york to provide lists for seizure or surrender of firearms . In the one case , you have a law that is meant to insure that everybody has a weapon , i the other , it is a law determined to limit the accessibility of weapons . You really do n't see the difference here ?
Because natural selection works on a cost/benefit basis . For bats and whales and cave-dwelling birds echolocation confers huge advantage , allowing them to exploit niches closed to competing species . For ground- or tree-dwelling terrestrial animals , it would be of marginal or zero benefit , given the 'noise ' in their immediate surroundings .
and the others do n't want to believe ( hope there is n't ) a god
HA wouldnt you say someone who is really overweight actually has more of a problem with stress on their joints , muscels , heart , and bladder than a woman carrying a small child in her womb ? Obesity can demand major scarifices in behavior and diet . Some of which can be detrimental . I really dont see your point because this isnt just a woman 's problem when it comes to these issues you pointed out . And im not really sure what a `` pregnancy '' is according to you.. please explain.. When i hear the word pregnant , i think of 2 people , not just 1 . Also , the baby has its own blood , its own immune system , and contains its own calories once consumed . theres nothing that the mother has that the baby doesnt other than it just needs nutrtion . Just like you need food everyday .
I 'm not mad at religion , but I do pity the rationalizations it creates .
so if cells are controlled by their genes ( and the environment ) , what would you predict would happen to the cell if its genes were removed ?
Actually , society has n't said this . 5 judges , in very recent times , have . I for one think that some 17 year olds fully comprehend the full implications of murder , and therefore should be held accountable in the same way as an 18 year old . I guess I just do n't see any reason why a jury could not address the issue on a case by case basis . I do not see the `` 18 and over execution rule '' in the eighth amendment .
And we have a paranoid post with no content whatsoever . Once again you see a conspiracy where none exist . You 're also showing your paranoia again by referring to my `` twin '' , but you go right ahead and keep a count of whatever you want ( a little hint-when you get to 10 , use your toes )
Actually , no , they do n't . The job of the Navy is to protect U.S. national security . They are not charged with the defense of private citizens sailing international waters .
It is when you rely on them to determine what is to be right and wrong in other people 's lives . Since you are heterosexual and have rallied against gay rights/gay marriage you have done this and are therefore imposing your religion on others .
Actually , as Another Opinion pointed out , there are more considerations beyond that . Emotional ones . Some people would have a hard time giving up some part of themselves ( or how ever they see it ) , thus there are the cases of changed minds . Others may constantly worry later on 'how is s/he doing , are they okay or not ... ' in regards to the child . I was merely addressing certain aspects of this topic .
Students become confused when the school curriculum implies that what their parents taught them is wrong .
Not at all . You said
You know , Gradualism is n't the only side of the story . There 's also a model of evolution called Punctuated Equilibrium .
`` 'Arms ' in this context were military arms not the personal weapons of private individuals . The context of 'depriving of the whole nation of arms ' was the refusal of the British to conscript Indians into the British Army during the First World War . Gandhi was an extreme anti-militarist . The statement is odd coming out of him , but he used the circumstance for political purposes to advance the cause of Home Rule and Independence . '' http : //www.potowmack.org/thequotes.html # gandhi
Really ? Well , when I have a kid , I 'll be sure to just leave it in the woods , since it can apparently care for itself .
Yea dude I 'm not gay and homosexuality is not unnatural .
And your cowardice in not addressing that elsewhere , but instead trying to snipe away by applying it in other threads where it does n't belong ...
I believe that Jo Bennett has just stated that Keynesianism is essentially a repudiation of the free market so I ca n't possibly see how Keyneisanism can be a theory of the `` free market . ''
Unlike California , amendments in Iowa must pass the legislature first ( simple majority ) before going to the voters . While I know little about the Iowa legislature , this seems a no brainer in a populace vote , considering previous votes and more current polls on this subject in Iowa . As a rule I lend polls very little credence , but DOMA passed by a wide majority in 1998 . I doubt things have changed enough to cover the gap , a lot of traditional values and religious folks in Iowa .
No , it sounds like he 's saying people should be able to have arms so they can be trained to the point where they can be considered a well-regulated militia .
So we ca n't base our definition of `` kind '' on mere appearances ? I mean if we are going to put things into categories and call the category `` kind '' , we should do this by common appearances . A penguin is in the same kind as a hummingbird , but is a lobster in the same kind as an oyster ? Obviously a lobster and a shrimp would be in the same kind , but could a dolphin and a manatee be in the same kind ? Did they evolve from a common ancestor kind ? And since apes look and act so much like humans , did n't they just evolve from humans ? By all appearances , they we must all be in the same kind .
Most bats have eyes . Aside from that , the answer to your question is , once again , a big `` Duhr ... '' . Echolocation is superior to vision because it works no matter how much light exists . Optical vision only functions if there 's light , and low and behold , most bats feed and live in darkness .

Yes , let 's prosecute someone for following the law .
And what exactly did it take to get such a low number ? Exactly how much of a police state are you willing to tolerate for a few less murders each year ? What human rights and freedoms are you willing to give up ? Are you willing to let the police come into your home without a warrant and make regular , unannounced , unscheduled inspections to ensure that there are no illegal contraband in the area ? At what point will you finally reach the conclusion that the price outweighs the gain ?
Because society teaches us what is acceptable . Those who fail to learn are known as criminals . They are sociopaths .
You 're over-egging the pudding a little , SS :
Well , if I 'm allowed to go purely on what I see , I 've never seen an illegally owned firearm in the UK , and handguns are ( for all intents and purposes ) banned here . This should be a knock-down argument , should it not ? If you do n't want to go on what you read or hear , why are you debating the issue online ?
ICBM , but I believe the termites make up the largest land-based biomass on earth .
So , whenever anyone tells you something you do n't want to believe , they are lying atheists . How far do you think that attitude is going to get you in life ? And what about Christians who accept evolution ? Are they lying ? What about Christians who do scientific research that confirms evolution ? Are they lying ? To go back to the first statement I quoted , when you dismiss all the evidence we bring up as lies , how are we supposed to convince you of anything ? Or is this just a one-way street ? It is our duty to be convinced by you ? To me :
If you ca n't prove or deal in absolutes , then the basis of your argument , the `` absolute '' nature of logic , just became pretty shaky .
The classical oath seems intrinsically sexist , however . The oath specifically mentions teaching medicine to sons , while daughters are not mentioned . The quote you mention follows the same vein , that women 's desires are not considered ( whether to persue medicine or control their reproduction ) .
And why would you say something like this ? Because Christianity prohibits it ? I ca n't think of any other reason .
Well , considering that quote comes from somebody whose throat I would just as soon slit as have come within ten feet of my child , it means nothing .
Soooo lets see . You are denying a slippery slope exists . OK we have all of the gun laws you guys got during the Clinton Administration . 1.The assault weapons ban . 2.The ten round magazine , 3.institution of the waiting period , 4.Brady background checks for all handgun buyers , 5.Excessive fees and regulations that drove many legitimate gun shop owners out of business . 6.Making it illegal for anyone under 18 to own or even possess a handgun . 7.The President 's executive order stopping the importation of many guns , 8 . Additional disqualification 's and changes to legal firearms purchases on form 4473 , 9 . Insta Check ! 10 . The widening of Brady to include background checks from just handguns to include all new firearm purchases . 11 Lautenburg . and just recently the NICS improvement act ! But Yet , you want to add even more gun laws . But the Slippery Slope does not exist ? Is that what you are saying ? We have on this board alone , demands on our Constitution 's Bill of Rights of total Gun Registration , Mandatory Storage with as of yet undefined penalties , a photo ID . Some advocate banning Assault Weapons , and you yourself have put forth several arguments that the 2nd amendment is not an Individual Right , and it applies only to a states right to form a militia . But the slippery slope does not exist !
did n't Kevin Costner do a movie about this in 1995 ?
Well if a man wishes to father he should have a legal agreement with the woman to mother his child . Rights and duties implied . Cylene Gama
Actually yes , yes it is .
Population should decrease ? Are you making another one of your anti-evolutionary statements ? Populations are supposed to grow . However , the caucasian population is shrinking . You need to have 2.9 children in order to reproduce the population , but almost all of the European nations and the US ar n't even producing that many . Our population is growing , but only because of hispanics .
No . Chemists have a theory ( abiogenesis ) . Creationists have a belief .
When was the last time there was ever a mass murder at a gun range full or armed patrons ? Or an International Practical Shooting Confederation match ? Or any of our shooting sports that people come from all over the world to take part in ? If the `` gun culture of America '' is truly to blame for all these campus massacres , how come none of the shooters ever seem to be members of the NRA , or took part in a hunter 's safety course , or anything else along those lines ?
But what if it is unconstitutional , like Prop . 8 ?
parcum , they are like any other medical facility , saying this is like saying that just because my physician just happens to be do some surgeries , he will always tell me I need to have a surgery- because of course , he will make more money off me then . You dont like the fact that planned parenthood performs abortions , and so you feel the need to slanderize them . Some rabid pro=lifer told you that , and you swallowed it hook , line and sinker . You obviously have no clue into the idea of customer service- which is the field I work in . You try to do whatever is in the best interest of the customer , even if it sends them to your competition . IN the case of planned parenthood , it is against their policy to recommend that a patient do anything but dicuss it with their own support system , be that friends , family , clergy or whatever . Any employee of theirs who breaks that policy is making them liable for legal recourse , and will also be likely to lose their job . I wonder , does your high school offer logic courses ? Please do us all a favor and invest in one .
Oh , I would wager about like Mexico , about 80 % fewer than guestimated . Funny you would ask that when the puts the finger squarely on gangs . How is that drug war working out in Mexico or Canada for that matter . Think the gangs are for smuggling dope or guns ? What causes the problems ? Dope but they also have guns . I wonder how a national dope registry would work
Murder is ALWAYS illegal .
Who wants healthcare run by large corporations that have rigged the market for cost twice as large as in other developed countries ?
Oh , so business owners do n't make `` real '' contributions to society ?
You wish . I doubt that it shall be so .
So how do you explain the nylon bug ? It can do something its ancestors could not - for the very simple reason that it 's not the same as its ancestors .
Would it be the lawless Cardinal Law officiating at one of the funerary masses for JPII and otherwise serving in a prominent role in all the pomp and circumstance surrounding the pope 's death ?
Homeless , yes , as long as they 're legal residents . Illegal aliens , no . Health care is a civil right , but not a human one . There are no human rights .
What ? Women are being forced into having sex ?
You are incorrect when it comes to the age of the earth . All inidciation by all branches of science indicate an earth that is over 3 billion years old . ( aside from the lies of the Young earth creationism . Each and every one of those 'indications ' are based on misunderstandings and out right lies about science . A discussion about the various methods ( and where the YEC claims go wrong can be found at http : //www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-age-of-earth.html
But same-sex marriage is NOT a fundamental right at this point . THAT 'S what up for vote in the first place . You are assuming the premise before the premise has even been decided . If a non-handicapped person gets mad because they are n't getting disability and others ' are , and those who prefer to protect disability try to do so by putting it to a vote , it 's pretty disingenuous for the non-handicapped person to say `` voting on fundamental rights like disability is fundamentally flawed '' . Disability may be a fundamental right for some people , but the issue is whether or not it is for ALL people .
So you think that ID is actually Christanity ? [ quote ] But in usual fashion you will claim it is me who does n't understand when it is you who must corrupt the truth with the lies and distortions you tell .
What is the fun in that ?
So you see , Brady , you 're wrong again . The McDonald ruling was n't an issue of guaranteeing white men their ability to feel safe in the face of growing minority groups . Quite the opposite . The McDonald ruling was about striking against those with racist and evil intentions who would use the law to render innocent people helpless for no good reason . It was as much about protecting minorities from harm as anything .
For years I 've tried to get one of our resident gay members to debate me on that fact . To date , no takers . Want to step up ?

Actually , yes it is sickening .
Whose hands do they have ?
Rarely has truth ever supported one side of a political movement .
1 . I consider my arguments to be `` anti-elective abortion '' not `` pro-life . '' And I would appreciate it if you would try to understand the differences between the two . `` Pro-lifers '' approach the abortion debate from an `` all life is sacred '' generally religious based point of view . I do not . I neither believe that `` all life is sacred '' nor that `` god '' or religion should be used in the debate at all . 2 . My argument that a `` human individual 's life biologically begins at conception '' is not an `` assumption . '' It 's is a conclusion reached by an indepth study of the facts and references available .
Well , why need Jesus then ? For salvation from sin . Well , where did this sin originate ? From Adam and Eve starting the fall of man from grace . Well , they never existed ...
Funny , did n't hear them complaining about the Iraqis dying in the street . also they did n't seem to mind that the abortion rate which was declining under clinton has been raising under Bush ... maybe they 're not that bothered .
This will be interesting . I 'm Keeping my fingers crossed .
Because the modern application of gun control is to target everyone . But that does n't change the fact that gun control began as a purely racist concept .
think of it as a photocopy of a check for a million dollars . yes the copy is in the image and likeness of the original check , but it is not the check . you can not cash the photocopy , regardless of how accurate the copy is , it is not the check , only an image of it . that does n't mean anything is `` wrong '' with the original , and it doesnt mean that the copy has to have all the properties and function of the original . its just an image
The logic we use to make statements about reality is derived from the way we observe material things behaving , and that logic is not immutable . Quantum physics demonstrates the fundamentally uncertain nature of reality at very tiny scales : the 'law of excluded middle ' in particular taking it firmly in the shorts . Given that logic can vary on such a simple metric as physical scale , your argument is starting to look more than a bit frayed at the edges
Says a person from the only nation to have used a nuclear weapon in anger . Youre a young country , but youre fast surpassing our death toll . Id personally argue that in many cases the British Empire brought benefits to the nations involved . Some countries werent even conquered ...
You better read it again dude .
Of course .
No argument . But the thread start started with how Europe was going to be Arab due to all the non-Arabs having all these abortions - - well not that many of them are .
Me neither . I do know it 's a funny thing to watch SS say such things despite having his own belief shot , bagged , tagged and buried
I think there are some things they will habitually avoid discussing . After a while , even Archie realizes the claims he makes that are no-brainer false .
Show me where Ben Stein is quoted in these links or this debate at all . And disprove my evidence for once if you can rather than change the subject or derail the debate with snipes and off topic minutia . Are you actually suggesting that McIntyre and McKitrick are the only voices which oppose the fraud of man made global warming ? How about the actual scientists who reject the media promotion of this issue ? Here 's an excerpt : Climatologists Reject Media Claims of Global Warming Consensus `` [ i ] n November 2004 , German climatologist Hans von Storch , director of the GKSS Institute for Coastal Research ( IfK ) in Geesthacht , Germany , foresaw that claims of alarmist consensus would be made by nonscientists ... '' Environment & amp ; Climate News > August 2005 Environment Environment > Climate : Consensus Email a Friend Written By : Alan Caruba Published In : Environment & amp ; Climate News > August 2005 Publication date : 08/01/2005 Publisher : The Heartland Institute Leading climatologists spent the month of June fighting false proclamations from non-scientists claiming scientists have reached agreement that catastrophic global warming is occurring . Alarmists Claim Debate Over On June 1 , California Gov . Arnold Schwarzenegger ( R ) claimed `` the debate is over '' and global warming alarmists ' predictions had carried the day . The Natural Resources Defense Council on June 9 declared , `` The world 's leading scientists now agree that global warming is real and is happening right now . According to their forecasts , extreme changes in climate could produce a future in which erratic and chaotic weather , melting ice caps and rising sea levels usher in an era of drought , crop failure , famine , flood and mass extinctions . '' On June 13 , USA Today declared , `` The debate 's over : Globe is Warming . '' In support of its claim , the newspaper cited the positions of some left-leaning religious groups , some corporations who will reap a financial windfall from a switch to alternative fuel sources , and some politicians . Scientists Disagree While each of the above claims from non-scientists received significant media coverage , leading climatologists spent the month of June rebutting such proclamations . Atmospheric physicist S. Fred Singer , professor emeritus of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and former director of the U.S . Weather Satellite Service , sent a letter to the editor of USA Today directly refuting its claim . `` Your editorial ... claim [ s ] the global warming debate is over . Not so , '' wrote Singer . Singer wrote , `` Sea level will continue to rise by only seven inches per century as it has for thousands of years no matter what we do or what the EPA [ U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ] says . And temperatures in the next 100 years will likely rise by less than one degree F -- not exactly a catastrophe . '' Added Singer in a subsequent letter to the Canadian media , `` Thousands of scientists from many countries now fully understand that Kyoto and other efforts to control human emissions of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) are ineffective and entirely unfounded scientifically . `` Even if you ignore the enormous cost of Kyoto ( estimated recently by Prof. George Taylor of Oregon State University -- see http : //www.sitewave.net/news/s49p628.htm -- at one trillion U.S. dollars a year for full implementation in OECD countries ) , climate science research is rapidly moving AWAY from the hypothesis that the human release of greenhouse gases , specifically CO2 , is in any way significantly contributing to global climate change . '' Sun Called Primary Cause `` If we just look at the historical data , there is a scientific consensus that the global mean temperature has risen modestly during the twentieth century , '' said Myron Ebell , director of global warming and environmental policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute . `` The impacts have been small and probably beneficial in aggregate . This historical data puts the onus of demonstration on those who think this gradual warming trend will accelerate and lead to dire consequences . '' The controlling driver of global temperature fluctuations , according to Dr. Benny Peiser of England 's John Moore 's University , is solar ray activity . `` Six eminent researchers from the Russian Academy of Science and the Israel Space Agency have just published a startling paper in one of the world 's leading space science journals . The team of solar physicists claims to have come up with compelling evidence that changes in cosmic ray intensity and variations in solar activity have been driving much of the Earth 's climate , '' Peiser was quoted as saying in the May 17 National Post . Moreover , reports Peiser , Jan Veizer , one of Canada 's top earth scientists , published a comprehensive review of recent findings and concluded , `` empirical observations on all time scales point to celestial phenomena as the principal driver of climate , with greenhouse gases acting only as potential amplifiers . '' Added Peiser , `` In fact , the explicit and implicit rejection of the 'consensus ' is not restricted to individual scientists . It also includes distinguished scientific organizations such as the Russian Academy of Science and the U.S. Association of State Climatologists , both of which are highly skeptical of the whole idea . `` Heartland Institute - Article And here 's more : Renowned Scientist Defects From Belief in Global Warming & # 8211 ; Caps Year of Vindication for Skeptics October 17 , 2006 October 17 , 2006 Washington DC - One of the most decorated French geophysicists has converted from a believer in manmade catastrophic global warming to a climate skeptic . This latest defector from the global warming camp caps a year in which numerous scientific studies have bolstered the claims of climate skeptics . Scientific studies that debunk the dire predictions of human-caused global warming have continued to accumulate and many believe the new science is shattering the media-promoted scientific & # 8220 ; consensus & # 8221 ; on climate alarmism . Claude Allegre , a former government official and an active member of France & # 8217 ; s Socialist Party , wrote an editorial on September 21 , 2006 in the French newspaper L'Express titled & # 8220 ; The Snows of Kilimanjaro & # 8221 ; ( For English Translation , click here : U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works ) detailing his newfound skepticism about manmade global warming . See : http : //www.lexpress.fr/idees/tribune ... asp ? ida=451670 Allegre wrote that the & # 8220 ; cause of climate change remains unknown & # 8221 ; and pointed out that Kilimanjaro is not losing snow due to global warming , but to local land use and precipitation changes . Allegre also pointed out that studies show that Antarctic snowfall rate has been stable over the past 30 years and the continent is actually gaining ice . & # 8220 ; Following the month of August experienced by the northern half of France , the prophets of doom of global warming will have a lot on their plate in order to make our fellow countrymen swallow their certitudes , & # 8221 ; Allegre wrote . He also accused proponents of manmade catastrophic global warming of being motivated by money , noting that & # 8220 ; the ecology of helpless protesting has become a very lucrative business for some people ! & # 8221 ; Allegre , a member of both the French and U.S. Academy of Sciences , had previously expressed concern about manmade global warming . `` By burning fossil fuels , man enhanced the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which has raised the global mean temperature by half a degree in the last century , '' Allegre wrote 20 years ago . In addition , Allegre was one of 1500 scientists who signed a November 18 , 1992 letter titled & # 8220 ; World Scientists ' Warning to Humanity & # 8221 ; in which the scientists warned that global warming & # 8217 ; s & # 8220 ; potential risks are very great. & # 8221 ; See : Warning to Humanity Allegre has authored more than 100 scientific articles , written 11 books and received numerous scientific awards including the Goldschmidt Medal from the Geochemical Society of the United States . Allegre 's conversion to a climate skeptic comes at a time when global warming alarmists have insisted that there is a & # 8220 ; consensus & # 8221 ; about manmade global warming . Proponents of global warming have ratcheted up the level of rhetoric on climate skeptics recently . An environmental magazine in September called for Nuremberg-style trials for global warming skeptics and CBS News & # 8220 ; 60 Minutes & # 8221 ; correspondent Scott Pelley compared skeptics to & # 8220 ; Holocaust deniers. & # 8221 ; See : U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works & amp ; Scott Pelley And Catherine Herrick On Global Warming Coverage - Public Eye In addition , former Vice President Al Gore has repeatedly referred to skeptics as `` global warming deniers . '' This increase in rhetorical flourish comes at a time when new climate science research continues to unravel the global warming alarmists & # 8217 ; computer model predictions of future climatic doom and vindicate skeptics . 60 Scientists Debunk Global Warming Fears Earlier this year , a group of prominent scientists came forward to question the so-called & # 8220 ; consensus & # 8221 ; that the Earth faces a & # 8220 ; climate emergency. & # 8221 ; On April 6 , 2006 , 60 scientists wrote a letter to the Canadian Prime Minister asserting that the science is deteriorating from underneath global warming alarmists . & # 8220 ; Observational evidence does not support today 's computer climate models , so there is little reason to trust model predictions of the future & # 8230 ; Significant [ scientific ] advances have been made since the [ Kyoto ] protocol was created , many of which are taking us away from a concern about increasing greenhouse gases . If , back in the mid-1990s , we knew what we know today about climate , Kyoto would almost certainly not exist , because we would have concluded it was not necessary , & # 8221 ; the 60 scientists wrote . See : Open Kyoto to debate & # 8220 ; It was only 30 years ago that many of today 's global-warming alarmists were telling us that the world was in the midst of a global-cooling catastrophe . But the science continued to evolve , and still does , even though so many choose to ignore it when it does not fit with predetermined political agendas , & # 8221 ; the 60 scientists concluded.. : U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works : : Press Room : . So in conclusion , as the alleged science of evolution is based solely on pre-determined assumptions , so is the myth of Global Warming .
NO ONE HAS TO HAVE A GUN ! The point is is that the choice should be up to the individual . If a criminal thinks you are armed he will move on ( or he has a death wish )
We could go back and fourth several times carefully picking and choosing words and phrases to describe what we think science should be , and possibly not disagree all that much . But to focus on this debates resolution , we need to get to what science is in schools today - a murky combination of facts and theories . Considering what Stephen Grocott had to say ( in the copy/paste in my first post ) about the definition of science , I do n't think we 're going to get it any clearer than that . Which facts and theories are emphasized to students and which ones are not are determined by the worldviews of the teaching establishment . Scientific facts can be taught without the worldview of the teacher being a factor , but scientific theories can not . Also , emphasizing one fact or theory over another will most likely reflect the worldview of the teacher , or the curriculum determined by the teaching establishment . So in an imperfect world , it 's clear that not all of what is taught as science is actually objective and non controversial .
Identity , or personality . A fetus does n't have either . You need a mind to have either as well . Anyways . This entire thread is just being redundant . All you have to do is read any of the other threads on the subject and you 'll get your answers . Otherwise we 're just repeating the same things over and over again .
And infinitely dense sphere of spacetime/matterenergy ?
What you are talking about here is the *potential* to exist being important . I would personally also thinking that potential existence is important , but not nearly as important as an existing person . After all , unfertilized eggs and sperm also have the *potential* to become full people but no one is concerned about their loss . For many of us it is the actual mentally-existing person that is most important . For both the 'braniac '' case you present and for the early term fetus , if there is no reason to kill it , then do n't . However , if there is a contest between the rights of a living , existing person and the rights of either *potential* person , then I think the rights of the living person win out .
The US is 3 trillion dollars in debt , abortion is not clear cut ( just visit a debate ) , and you appear to be stereotyping democrats . Also , you may need to read the first ammendment again . For your answer to work , people would have to agree with you first , then they would understand ( and agree with ) you .
Capital Punishment and Deterrence : Examining the Effect of Executions on Murder in Texas . Authors John Sorenson , Robert Wrinkle , Victoria Brewer , and James Marquart examined executions in Texas between 1984 and 1997 . They speculated that if a deterrent effect were to exist , it would be found in Texas because of the high number of death sentences and executions within the state . Using patterns in executions across the study period and the relatively steady rate of murders in Texas , the authors found no evidence of a deterrent effect . The study concluded that the number of executions was unrelated to murder rates in general , and that the number of executions was unrelated to felony rates . ( 45 Crime and Delinquency 481-93 ( 1999 ) ) . Deterrence , Brutalization , and the Death Penalty : Another Examination of OklahomaÕs Return to Capital Punishment . In this study , author William Bailey speculated that if executions had a deterrent effect in Oklahoma , it would be observable by comparing murder rates and rates of sub-types of murder , such as felony-murder , stranger robbery-related killings , stranger non-felony murder , and argument-related killings , before and after the resumption of executions . Bailey examined the period between 1989 and 1991 for total killings and sub-types of killing . After controlling for a number of variables , Bailey found that there was no evidence for a deterrent effect . He did , however , find that there was a significant increase in stranger killings and non-felony stranger killings after Oklahoma resumed executions after a 25-year moratorium . ( 36 Criminology 711-33 ( 1998 ) ) .
Inference is part of the scientific method -- probably the most important part , at that . Without it we would discover nothing , for we can prove very little to begin with . Bear in mind that `` proof '' is an extremely high standard . Proof is the level at which a proposition 's truth value is necessary ( ex : given how we define `` two , '' it is impossible for `` two '' to not be `` one '' plus `` one '' ) . Inference on the other hand is the only option outside of mathematics . With that in mind , the fact that we ca n't prove much of anything is more or less irrelevant ; what we can do is find lots and lots of supporting evidence and safely infer information from it .
So you have genes for brown eyes and for blue eyes and for green eyes ? Chihuahuas have the genes to make them Great Danes ? Do the experiment , supersport . Do it . C'mon . Shut me up . I dare you . For someone always accusing `` Darwinists '' of never doing appropriate experiments , this is one you should have no problem doing . Hop to it . ( That 's your cue to run away and start a new thread . )
There have been several conducted by the department of justice .
What part of the Christian worldview ? A part of the Christian worldview says stealing is wrong , so you must mean stealing is good ? A part of the Christian worldview says rape is wrong , so you must mean rape is good ? A part of the Christian worldview says sexual immorality is wrong , so you must mean sexual immorality is good ?
Well thank god they conducted a fair and balanced assessment . You know as there was no biased behaviour here . What they should do next time to make it more fair is to get a corpse and put a gun in their hand and then invite a Navy SEAL along to see if the corpse can use a firearm . How do people think of these tests ? Honestly ?
My bet is I know more about it than you do . I am aware of the `` big picture '' because I know that evolutionary biology does n't apply the the origin of the universe . Please explain how the origin of the universe applies to genetic information . Why does a change in a population of organisms require an increase in information ?
Actually , if you want to check , you will find that biologists themselves will point out the holes . We still have a lot to learn . Many of the holes have been closed even in my lifetime and the creationist god-of-the-gaps is being reduced to smaller and smaller gaps . But if you want a creationist to `` join the real world '' , you 're going to have to do more than be offensive and insulting . You might present some actual facts to support your position . Of course , I presume that you will actually educate yourself before presenting the facts . Have a nice day .
This is just plain dumb . Abortion is NOT the primary means of birth control . If it is used as birth control , it 's because others have failed or have n't been tried .
And , God even gives Mary a choice as to whether or not she will bear the Son of God . Mary answers in Luke 1:38
I think it is really sad that the darwinists have gotten their religion back into the public schools of Kansas . I hope this gets changed soon .
A lot more truth to this statement that a person would think . My statement was in jest , but somewhat true . Yes , the jurors could not vote on concrete evidence , but just how much circumstantial evidence do jurors need anyway ? To quote the mighty TS , if it looks like a duck , walks like a duck , quacks like a duck , craps like a duck , at what point does it become a duck ? ?
Well , if you make the argument that if someone took the time to write it , it must be true I 'm totally convinced ! Good job on failing to provide a shred of actual evidence to show that God actually changed the laws of physics . By the way , if I 'm so dishonest about your claims making God a liar , why have you outright refused to explain your original argument ? `` Archangel , if you think you are so right , where is the evidence that the physical laws dictating how light behaves in a medium has changed in the past ? '' No reply . `` So God deceived us by creating a system that today works as we know it in a way that refutes Literal Creationism and has absolutely no evidence of being different at any time in the past but secretly made the named light sources abide to his secondary set of physical laws which he then removed from creation without a trace . '' How does that not make God an epic liar ? '' No reply . `` I 'm betting you do n't even understand your original argument . Prove me wrong . Explain how it does not result in God being a liar. `` No reply . I seriously doubt you even understand the original argument you gave especially since you cited a website that argued against YEC because it forces God to have deceived us either in the Bible or the natural world . Note that Birden said this : `` If they go the # 1 route , then they must defend against the 'God is a deceiver ' argument . If they go the # 2 route , then ( by invoking the miraculous ) they have effectively shut the science classroom door on the teaching of creationism . '' I see you lack the intellectual guts to deal with # 1 , and instead went for # 2 on the grounds if Bible says = True ! The problem is that you remove your argument from the realm of actual science and rely entirely upon Magic and the Supernatural . Neither of which are testable or teachable in the science classroom . Where have I ever claimed to be a Christian ? More lies from the Lie Factory . Besides if such miracles happened , why is there no physical evidence left from the change in the physical laws ? Oh wait I forgot . You ca n't answer actual science questions that rely upon empirical evidence . If the Bible says so therefore it is true ! Obviously SOMEONE took the time to write it , therefore it HAS to be true !
It 's even worse than that . He is n't asking for info on how it works ; if he was I would supply it gladly . He claims to already know that it 's wrong , which implies that he thinks he knows what it 's about . But despite already knowing what carbon dating is , he still needs someone here to provide an explanation before he can present his `` proof '' that it 's incorrect . As Akbar says , `` It 's a trap ! ''
The bible tells me to take it litterally . What more authority do I need to follow ?
But that 's the argument you were presenting . The use of `` car '' is really irrelevant . You can substitute `` buying a car '' with any activity that one might engage in where they could later view it as positive or negative . The point is , you are attempting to use someones negative emotional view to argue aganist something that can be a positive experience for others . I was attempting to point out that yes , while you are entitled to have an opinion and share that opinion with everyone , this does not give you the right to determine what is right for others . If you find abortion to be that objectionable , great ... do n't ever have one . But do not try to use 1 persons negative viewpoint of abortion to tell others what they may or may not do . I am willing to bet that for every person you find who regrets their abortion that you would be able to find one person who found their abortion to be the right choice for them . Oh , and in case you missed my request ... could you please give the number of the Planned Parenthood clinic that you called so the rest of us could listen to it ?
So we should wait till the blastocyst is definitely a tumour , in case it turns into a fetus ?
I think that you are correct in this assumption , but since you do not define either 'intelligent ' or 'design ' , I can not be certain that we are not already at cross-purposes .
Maybe you could show us evidence that your assertion of the `` illusion '' of adaptation and long term evolution has been observed . The burden of proof is on you , my dear .
Evolutionists do not likely believe we started with nothing nor with two elements nor do they believe that combining elements with time created physical laws or anything else metioned . The author here either does not believe this and is intentionally misrepresenting his opponents , or he is grossly misinformed about evolution , or both .
1.3 billion people believe the lies of the Chinese government .
Ok , I 'll bite . How do you teach responsability by taking away a civil right ? Will they be able to own guns if they are taking a civics class ? How about a constitutional law class ? Maybe next they can prohibit athletes from owning a Crucifix or Star of David .
Could not agree more .

Mizmaxx -- Can you honestly tell me that you do not believe this statement ? Or are you advocating the discrimination of human beings based upon their place of residence . This is actually , in my opinion , one of Mr. Alcorns strongest points . However , it is based upon the premise that a fetus is a 'human being ' which is not established by law .
Really ? Is it the materialist evolutionary theory that you believe in ?
Completely wrong . One CAN prove a negative by showing that it is self contradictory ( ie a square circle ) . Also , proving a positive claim WRONG is not the same as proving a negative claim correct . In that sense , theories most definitely CAN be proven wrong , as Creationism has . The predictions which Creationism makes were false . It was dismissed a long time ago .
Actually to an anti-gunner than equilivant slander and propagada is perfectly logical . Please see how the NRA is equated with the KKK by an anti-gunner : `` In an animated history send-up , with the narrator talking rapidly , Bowling equates the NRA with the Klan , suggesting NRA was founded in 1871 , `` the same year that the Klan became an illegal terrorist organization . '' Bowling goes on to depict Klansmen becoming the NRA and an NRA character helping to light a burning cross . '' http : //www.liberalvalues.org.nz/arch ... e_fiction.html

Actually no , Duo has not . If you had ever bothered to read any previous posts by Duo in THIS forum you would ALREADY know he explained this assertation multiple times . You are once again making assumptions .
Read the entire verse and do n't edit out parts of it . `` When you march up to attack a city , make its people an offer of peace . If they accept and open their gates , all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you . If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle , lay siege to that city . '' Hmmmm ... death or slavery . Wow , that 's a hard choice .
An American citizen with rights AND RESPONSIBILITIES ! ! ! There is no right in the constitution that allows her to be a jerk who breaks the law with impunity and then refuses to cooperate with the cops who are responsible for public safety .
Wrong .
Ah , so the dictionary is the ultimate authority ? And all the way down to the 5th definition no less ? New name for you : `` Dictionary boy . '' Thanks for demonstrating that you really are nothing but a sophist ( Go look THAT up in your precious dictionary ) .
You do n't get it do you ? `` our side '' has never said we where above these things . Your side takes the `` moral highground '' they set up a standard of being holier then thou . There is no hypocrisy in pointing out those who ca n't live up to the standard they set for themselves or would legally force upon the rest of us . The problem is that your side has made sex evil and dirty and our side is just pointing that out to you . BTW here is your link http : //www.365gay.com/Newscon07/07/071007vitter.htm http : //news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070710/ ... itter_dc_madam http : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & amp ; c ... ss & amp ; btnG=Search
People that are willing to make up such quotes would probably also be willing to make up such a memo .
Hmm , I wonder why that is ?
Consider the source ... Planned Parenthood is far from an objective source . For example : From PP site ... `` Claim : Many women who have an abortion suffer severe and lasting psychological damage . Expert Opinion : Serious emotional problems following abortion are uncommon . Most women report a sense of relief , although some may experience temporary depression . Serious psychological disturbances after abortion occur less frequently than after childbirth. `` I know 2 women , both had abortions 30 years ago and they both regret it every day . A lot of their other `` expert opinions '' were nothing more than pro-abortion spin .
And your not beef , your bull XXXX .
Well , its not just morally wrong in America , but its morally wrong in the middle east as well . And i think that if we continue our way downward morally as a nation , it would give terrorists even more hate for america because we are supposedly a `` christian nation '' and dont live morally . anyways .
Well , that explains the scientific illiteracy but it does n't explain the bizarre theology and the weak understanding of philosophy .
The fact that the sun rises every day is not evidence for the sun orbiting the Earth , this effect is seen because of the rotation of Earth . ToE does not state that `` life forms are similar to each other '' . Direct evidence for ID/Creationism has never been established so there is no reason to suppose it to be true . Direct evidence for allele frequency change is freely available for all to see . You also need to define original , useful DNA . 4/10 . See me after class .
Clinton gave access to b/c which is known to prevent pregnancies . Bush has reduced access to b/c ( including e/c ) . A primary reason for aborting is money - Americans have been less well off under Bush .
But that is how creationism works - half truth . Evolution is a theory but do n't make it quite clear that in science the word theory does n't mean half-assed guess , as it does in creationism . Check out that little piece of **** that was added to the bottom of the Patterns of Cumulative Change paragraph on page 7 . That is pure YEC . And you are n't a YEC ?
Sandy suppose you lived in New York and knew it was 3000 miles between California and New York Now suppose there was a car that was parked in your driveway that you also knew had been driven from California and that car had a maximum speed of 100 miles per hour . That would of course mean it would have taken at least 30 hours to make the drive . Do you see how you could deduce that the car was at least 30 hours old ? Thats the same principle used for dating the stars and the universe . If we know how far away a star is and we know the maximum speed of light , then the star must be at least as old as the time it would take for the light to get to the earth so we could see it .
It 's called an analogy . The article claimed that the relationship between homosexuals and discrimination and between gun owners and discrimination is the same because the discrimination in both cases is because of `` who they are . '' Thus , I extended this analogy so that the relationship between gun owners and discrimination and between serial racists and discrimination is the same because the discrimination in both cases is because of `` who they are . '' The analogy that I made was not comparing gun owners to serial rapists , but rather , it was comparing the relationship of the two groups with discrimination . And what is your deal with lunatic fringe leftie ? Antigun laws are clearly not a fringe view , or gun control laws would not have been passed in Congress . You can hardly call the views lunatic . I doubt any doctor would agree that a person with liberal views regarding gun control is mentally insane . My anti-freedom agenda ? What the hell are you talking about ? Are you an anarchist ? That 's the only way to have 100 % freedom . The fact that government exists means that there are restrictions . So unless you are an anarchist , I can call you anti-freedom as much as you call me anti-freedom . The question is the degree to which government should restrict freedoms , and that is not an obvious question to answer . Can you please explain how my views on gun control reveal that I 'm racist . Have I proposed a law which would restrict gun usage for only a certain race ?
I agree that during debate of an issue like this both sides can get pretty nasty . However , you would be hard-pressed to find a place where those that are choice are screaming in your face , interrupting your personal life on an already hard day like this .
Exactly , there is absolutely no evidence that biologists could show you that would make you think , `` hey that would count of as transitional . Why ? Because you have already accepted your previous convictions and closed your mind to anything new . How about doing what Porky Pine asked and giving us your definition of a transitional form ? If you have spent any time at University , you should know that references older than 10 years should n't be used . Science has usually progressed sufficiently in this time , so that the information in the older articles/books , probably contains errors or invalid information . Scientists contradict each other all the time ? It 's the first step in finding correct answers . New hypotheses are proposed and tested , observations made etc and falsified ideas are discarded . It 's what makes it work .
But wait , you said that science is unprovable . How did we build up the world , conquer the air , sea and space without unprovable science ? !
Why are you surprised ? Raising the bar is a known tactic .
But procreation is so much fun Even better without protection Only drags when your belly pouches With wrist chained to little tikes
Thanks Duo . peddler , how about you actually address the points I put to you originally ? `` Off course , you might be trying to infer that because there are differences of opinion in the field of evolution makes the whole notion irrelevant . I disagree , but if you insist we will examine differences in opinion between different groups within , lets see ... ... ... how about Christianity ? Do they make the whole religion completely rejectable ? '' Cheers
How about the individual 's offspring ? Is a `` subtract 10 years '' gene encoded in the genome just because of one marriage ? Still no evidence .
So ... what was all that bull**** about terrorists exploiting America 's `` weak gun control laws '' in order to amass arsenals of deadly weapons ? It seems to me that they do n't need undercover operatives to come to America , forge documents and undergo background checks just to get civilian weapons . They 've got their own arms manufacturing plants over there , they can make whatever they need or want .
Yes that is a problem . But there is an instance when the 2nd Amendment did protect the USA from invaders : `` Someone at the table asked a Japanese admiral why , with the Pacific Fleet devastated at Pearl Harbor and the mainland US forces in what Japan had to know was a pathetic state of unreadiness , Japan had not simply invaded the West Coast '' - http : //www.backwoodshome.com/articles2/ayoob70.html If it was n't for the 2nd Amendment you would be speaking Japanese if you live on the West coast , German if you live on the East coast .
Uh-oh ... Pay no attention at all to the man behind the curtain !
Your love of assumption is quite amusing ( it also highlights your inability to argue honestly ) . All I did was point out that accidents are a cause of injuries and fatalities dealing with firearms . Nowhere did I suggest banning them in the slightest . Furthermore , I specifically noted that most of the accidents were due to improper gun safety . So how about you take the stick out of your XXX and stop assuming whatever the **** you want for a change ? You are a joke Isly . About time you admit it .
** As above , 'social classes ' are 'populations ' , and modern darwinian evolution focuses entirely on the 'evolution ' of 'populations ' , NOT individual organisms . Neo-Lamarkian theory focuses on individual , internally driven effort , instead of inherited advantage , which is the be-all and end-all of Darwinism , and of modern economic and political social theory . Just as it has always been .
THE ONLY QUESTION ABOUT GUN REGISTRATION by Alan Korwin Dear Editor , Only one thing is overlooked in the common-sense proposals to register guns , so here it is . How exactly would writing down my name , or your name , help arrest criminals or make you safer ? Although at first blush , gun listing has a sort of tantalizing appeal , on reflection you have to wonder whether gun lists would be an instrument of crime control at all . The unfortunate answer is that , no matter how good it feels when the words first pass your ears , registering honest gun owners does n't stop criminals , and in fact focuses in exactly the opposite direction . It is an allocation of resources that has no chance of achieving its goal , if that goal is the reduction of crime . 1 . Registering 70 million American households is extremely expensive . Do you know what it takes to run a database that big ? You need 19,000 changes daily , just to keep up with people who move every ten years . Floor after floor of cubicle after cubicle for employees with permanent jobs , payroll , parking and dry cleaning bills . It 's a government jobs program all by itself , all in the common sense -- but deceptive name -- of stopping crime . How many criminals do you figure will register when all is said and done ? That 's right , none , and the planners know that . All that money and time , invested on tracking the innocent . That 's why so many police departments are against it -- they 'll be forced to run huge data centers with their limited resources , and hire clerks instead of cops . 2 . Americans who fail to register would become felons without committing a crime . Under registration , activity that is a common practice and has been perfectly legal since inception makes you a felon . Think about that . Possession of private property would subject you to felony arrest , if the property is n't on the government 's master list . Boy , that does n't sound like the American way . No other evil is needed , there is no victim and no inherent criminal act takes place . Paperwork equals prison . That 's just wrong . 3 . Registration , if enacted , will create an underground market for unregistered guns bigger than the drug trade . How many times must an elite forbid what the public wants , before learning the unintended consequences of outlawing liberties ? People get what they want either way , it 's just a question of how much crime the government itself forces to accompany it . With respect to guns , the last thing you want to encourage is the creative import programs and price supports that drug dealers enjoy , for gun runners . 4 . People have said to me , `` But Alan , if all guns were registered and there was a crime , then you could tell . '' Tell what ? If your neighbor is shot , that 's not probable cause to search everyone with a matching caliber in a ten-block radius . The evidence needed to conclusively link a person to a crime has no connection at all to a registration plan -- you need motive , opportunity , witnesses , physical evidence , the murder weapon . Police are n't waiting for official lists so they can start catching murderers . Gun registration schemes lack a crime prevention component . 5 . You do n't really think authorities would use gun registration lists to confiscate weapons from people , do you ? Despite real-life examples recently of exactly that in New York , California and Louisiana , and global history for the past century , this could n't really happen , do you think ? Who would even support such a thing in a country like America , with its Bill of Rights ? The guarantees against confiscating property , unwarranted seizures and the right to keep and bear arms would surely forestall any such abuse of power . Are there really U.S. politician who would support firearm seizures ? ( Unfortunately , it 's a long list of usual suspects . ) And what about the so-called First Amendment test ? If it 's OK for arms it must pass muster for words too . Why would an honest writer object to being on the government list of approved writers ? Why indeed . Pile logic on logic , some people just feel the government should register everything , just to keep control . When government has that much control , you no longer possess your liberties . You 're living where government lists define who can do what , and where people control trumps crime control -- the gun registration model precisely . This form of `` gun control '' is n't about guns , it 's about control . I might favor registration if the system would include criminals . In fact , I 'd favor testing the system on them first . But the U.S. Supreme Court , in a widely known case ( Haynes v. U.S. , 1968 ) , had determined that a felon who has a gun can not be compelled to complete such forms , because it violates the Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination . That 's right , mandatory registration -- not in your case of course but in the case of a criminal -- is a self-indictment of a crime , and is therefore prohibited . * Gun listing is a feel-good deception that passes unquestioned by the `` news '' media , engorges the federal or state bureaucracy , and undercuts the linchpins of American freedoms . It has no more place in a free society than a government authorized list of words , and should be rejected outright . Elected officials who promote such a scheme are opposing the very Constitution they take an oath to preserve , protect and defend , and deserve to be removed from office . Sincerely , Alan Korwin , Author Gun Laws of America * NOTE : This case only concerned a limited class of weapons , `` destructive devices , '' which are listed and tracked in a special federal registry under the National Firearms Act . Congress rewrote that law after Haynes to require only the legal transferor , and not the transferee , of such devices to file papers , and along with other clever changes this overcame the 5th Amendment problem . In U.S. v. Freed , 1971 , the Court agreed the problem had been fixed ( for possession of hand grenades by criminals in that particular case ) . A general registration scheme would run into a greater problem . A prohibited possessor can not have a firearm at all , so mere possession is a serious crime . An additional charge for failing to register the gun that ca n't be possessed would offend the 5th Amendment the same as in the Haynes case . However , possession of an unregistered gun by an ordinary citizen would turn that citizen into a felon , with no other illegal act but the paperwork failure . The innocent would have to register to remain legal , the illegal possessor could not register without violating the right to not incriminate yourself .
But it will stop the disease from being passed on to offspring ... Or is that unimportant ?
You 've had problems with this in other threads . You 've said that a modification to the genome is not new information , just 'altered ' information , which makes no sense at all . You ca n't alter information . You can alter physical stuff so that it stops representing one piece of information and starts representing another , but the idea that the information has altered is way off base . I could turn any sentence into any other sentence - even into a sentence that has never been written before - just by tweaking the letters one by one . Is the end product not a 'new ' sentence ?
But felons ca n't vote and I do n't see that in the Constitution , either . I do n't have a problem with preventing criminals from legally owning firearms . That said , I think it 's against our rights to be assumed to be a criminal without ever being convicted of a crime .
In time of war : The Israeli answer to terrorism by Massad Ayoob Issue # 81 `` Israel began the program of armed citizen guards in the schools after the Maalot massacre in the 1970s , when a large number of children were slain in a terrorist incident . The volunteer parents work in plain clothes , armed with concealed semi-automatic pistols , and are trained by Israel & # 8217 ; s home guard . It is significant that in the more than a quarter century between Maalot and the incident mentioned above when the citizen guards shot down the terrorist in the school in 2002 , not a single child was murdered in an Israeli school ! ''
Schumer is a bonafide XXXXX , as are many in the Senate . He failingly tried to draw Alito into exposing how he would rule on abortion if presented a case . Alito is far too intelligent to be logically trapped by a buffoon such as Shumer . It is also plain to see he interrupts when he supposes the response will indeed make sense against his flailings .
In 2000 , the U.S. recorded close to 11,000 firearm homicides and more than 16,000 firearm suicides . The European Union -- an area with a population approximately 25 % higher than that of the U.S. -- reported fewer than 1,300 firearm homicides for the same year . In Japan , the number was 22. sinjin - The US firearm homicide rate is more than 180x that of Japan .
What are you talking about here ? please be specific .
This does not mean that the column is fantastic nor imaginative . It may very well be that not all areas of the earth accumulated all types of rock that form the column ; this does not mean that the years at which similar columns were deposited in different places in the world are not similar . And of course , even if the Geologic column is not true , this provides no evidence of creationism .

Well , when I read the released portion of the transcript , it really looked like Kersey was acting on the understanding that the `` donor '' wanted to help African-American women who wanted to abort but could n't afford to go to an abortion clinic . ( Look at Kersey 's response to the `` donor '' 's question about `` underprivileged minority groups '' referring to `` women in need '' ; I guess Kersey is sexist , too ? ) Only later did the `` donor '' 's comments become strange . Even the release shows that Kersey thought that something was pretty odd . What 's especially hypocritical is for the The Advocate people to yell and scream about racism when the only racism expressed came from the `` donor . '' While I 'm not convinced that Kersey did anything terribly wrong based on that transcript , police action of the same sort would be considered entrapment . It 's a pathetic witch hunt so devoid of a target that they 're building straw men to attack .
Because that 's when the law says that they have the 'right to live . ' Rights are legal terms that are fabricated by humans . They are not constant , but rather change whenever we wish to change them .
Proof ? All I can think to say is that a mind is a terrible thing to waste .
But because your book of mythology tells you about a week of creation , you prefer that ( because it requires less thought ) to examining reality .
Lets look at what is claimed in the link I post . It 's origins were in response to & # 8220 ; Teddy bears are more regulated than guns. & # 8221 ; -- Violence Policy Center . The & # 8220 ; Unregulated & # 8221 ; Gun
Hardly any criminals go armed in England , and certainly not with guns . Burglars and muggers have enough sense to know that while getting done for burglary or mugging will not be pleasant , getting done for burglarly or mugging AND possession of a firearm will be far , far worse , assuming they survive the arrival of the armed response squad .
You blame others for your failure to understand the basics .
Is it possible for an omnipotent being to have a definable 'image ' ? I guess the stock answer is 'yes , He made us in it ' , but that 's somewhat ... unsatisfying . Are you implying that God is a hetrosexual ?
Yet he has n't . No pro-choice person I know wants abortion to be prevalent , they just want it to be an option . Wanting it safe and rare and available is not an abnormal positon for a pro-choice person .
So Lewontin is the person who determines the opinion of the general public or something ?
I 'm an atheist pretty much the same reason you are an atheist ( except for going to a religious school . I did n't really think it was fair and balanced at all . It protrayed atheists as lost from the true path . The reasons it gave for being atheist were they had n't found god yet , and a tradgedy . What about logically thinking about it ? And a RELIGIOUS STUDIES teacher says that atheism is just a phase ? They also say atheism is the easy way out . I think it 's easier to just believe in a god and be comforted . I 'm not saying people do but I 'd say Christianity is more of a quick fix than atheism . All you have to do is believe in god and you 're safe for your life and afterwards . Most Atheists do n't believe what they do just to rebel or have n't found God yet . Mostly it 's because they realized that there is no logical proof ( enough for them ) that there is God . They also said incorrectly that atheism is n't a religion . re·li·gion [ ri líjj ? n ] n 1. religion beliefs and worship : people ? s beliefs and opinions concerning the existence , nature , and worship of a deity or deities , and divine involvement in the universe and human life Microsoft® Encarta® Reference Library 2003 . © 1993-2002 Microsoft Corporation .

And upon what grounds do you base this claim ? Government chooses not to recognize different types of marriages all the time , not just same sex marriages ie . polygamist marriages , relatives , age limits , etc . These recognitions are not only federal but vary state to state , for instance some states recognize 1st cousin marriages while others do n't , as I recall , the age of consent to marry also differs among states .
Yea right , the chosen one told the pugnicans to sit down and shut up I won . More funny cake lady ! You are right the dems got the bill they wanted . 2000+ pages that no one knows whats in it . Robs Medicare to partly pay for it and who knows what other unpleasant nasty suprises are in it . Wise up no one wants your public option .
Cherry picking wo n't cover up the fact that in general developed nations with strict levels of gun control have much lower gun crime rates than the US . You 're missing the big picture . Besides , the shooter of German school students got the gun from his father 's legally owned gun collection .
And she has referenced her religious beliefs as the foundation of her position .
State courts can rule based on state and/or federal law . In this case , the answer was found in the state constitution , so the judge did not need to pursue the issue further . Also , a state constitution can offer more protection that the federal one , as long as , in so doing , it does not contradict the federal constitution .
The opposite is actually the case , to deny the sanctity of life is to sacrifice potential families on the alter of the religion of secularism , an extremism which denies humans their right place in nature , which sacrifices the welfare of children to a very narrow and restricted religious belief .
so why did ToE ignore horizontal gene transfer for so many decades ? Can you tell me how it is that gene transferred horizontally ( without going through selection ) validates darwinism , which says all beneficial traits must pass through selection in order to be adapted ?
Well then . We 've setteled that question , have n't we ?
Sure about that ?
Oh , some holes in the bottom of the ocean . Phew , I 'm so glad I was wrong . They did not date their works back then . Signatres were worth nothng back then . The witness , however , is every early christian and , of coarse , God himself . Actually , liquor is bought at a liquor store ( dee-de-dee ) . The mind is the product of God . Supersport meant spirit when he said mind . Again , the spirit lies the platform for the genes . I thought I had already made that clear .
I had not heard this ... do you have a source on it ?
I think it 's manifestly obvious that I 'm a prophet . Therefore , the question of my diety should also be of little surprise .
Well , since the composition of the uranium body when it was a natural reactor was n't the same as today 's natural uranium , it does n't matter . What is important was the composition of the ore back then . Since U-238 has a half-life of 4.468E+9 years and U-235 has a half-life of 7.038E+8 years , it is apparent that the U-235 decays much more rapidly . It stands to reason that the The relative percentage of U-235 to U-238 was higher in the past . It also stands to reason that thee was more uranimum present at the time that the natural reactors were active . About 2 billion years ago the U-235 was about 3 % or more of the composition of the uranium .
Kudos to athiests then .
Well , it is relevant , or at least was . It just is n't fundamental to the ToE , and even if Weismann 's barrier needs to be revised , that does n't mean that the ToE is invalid as well .
There are biliions of dollars to be made from the taxation of marjuana . Institutions like The DEA and the state and federal prison systems would see fincncial stress relieved from them . Its also a realistic way to increase revenue to lower the deficit Who 's to say what drug is bad for you and what one is n't ?
What if the answer to that was 0 ? You have begged the question .
So you honestly believe that with the technology available at the time , Noah constructed a monstrous synthetic habitat large enough to hold two of every creature on earth ? Complete with enough aquatic capacity to hold two of every ocean creature , including whales and sharks ? With enough travel speed to cover the entire globe in time to pick up two of every animal , from the burrowing frogs of the african desert to the Polar bears of Antarctica ? And that this vessel was also large enough to carry a supply of food adequate for so many hundreds of millions of animals ? And that the waste disposal systems were adequate to handle such a volume of waste ? I 'm sorry , but anyone with even a shred of credibility must take the story of Noah and his ark as nothing more than an interpretation and adaption of an ages old story . To interpret it as the literal truth is beyond belief .
I think that 's overly simplistic . I 've spoken with alot of creationists , both in forums and in real life , and many of them are quite intelligent and well educated . The problem is that people have an amazing ability to filter out things that do n't fit into their pre-conceived notions . I 'm sure you 've seen this in all sorts of different fields , it 's just most pronounced when someone is denying facts , rather than refuting an opinion . If someone is devoutly religious , and firmly believes in a literal interpretation of the Bible , then facts which contradict that belief simply do n't take hold . It 's not that they do n't understand logic or science . It 's more like they 've trained themselves to not hear things which go against their beliefs .
But you are . You ca n't just claim someone is not a person and therefore say you are not imposing beliefs on them . If this were the case then I 'd just say you are n't a person and therefore when I hurt you it would n't be wrong .
Directed variation seems unlikely : http : //www.blackwellpublishing.com/r ... ariation17.asp Would not selection of mating partners produce nonrandom variation ?
Oh ? Then what do you take this to mean ? : http : //www.accessmylibrary.com/comsi ... d=0286-6387354 `` researchers no longer believe that races are distinct biological categories created by differences in the genes that people inherit from their parents . '' http : //academic.udayton.edu/race/01race/race.htm There are no genetic characteristics possessed by all Blacks but not by non- Blacks ; similarly , there is no gene or cluster of genes common to all Whites but not to non-Whites . One 's race is not determined by a single gene or gene cluster , as is , for example , sickle cell anemia . Nor are races marked by important differences in gene frequencies , the rates of appearance of certain gene types . The data compiled by various scientists demonstrates , contrary to popular opinion , that intra-group differences exceed inter-group differences . That is , greater genetic variation exists within the populations typically labeled Black and White than between these populations . This finding refutes the supposition that racial divisions reflect fundamental genetic differences . Along the way , various minds tried to fashion practical human typologies along the following physical axes : skin color , hair texture , facial angle , jaw size , cranial capacity , brain mass , frontal lobe mass , brain surface fissures and convolutions , and even body lice . As one scholar notes , `` [ t ] he nineteenth century was a period of exhaustive and -- as it turned out -- futile search for criteria to define and describe race differences . `` . . . Attempts to define racial categories by physical attributes ultimately failed . By 1871 , some leading intellectuals had recognized that even using the word `` race '' `` was virtually a confession of ignorance or evil intent . '' The genetic studies of the last few decades have only added more nails to the coffin of biological race . Evidence shows that those features usually coded to race , for example , stature , skin color , hair texture , and facial structure , do not correlate strongly with genetic variation
Absolutely not . One of the points that have to be drilled into the heads of creationists over and over again is that natural selection is not random . You are either a liar or ignorant .

Okay , here is how it went : God made the animals . He said , '' Hey , Adam needs a helper . '' He brought the animals to Adam to name . He could n't find a helper for Adam . He then took a rib out of Adam 's side to create Eve . This was done on the sixth day . God created them both on the sixth day , Adam first , then Eve out of Adam 's side after he had Adam name the animals .
You know , I really do n't know if she does . I 'd like to think that she does care about the moral concerns of most people in the nation , but it 's starting to become more and more apparent that may not be the case . At the rate they are going , gay rights people in this country are going to bring a constitutional amendment on themselves before they truly realize the value of actually trying to see the issue through someone 's eyes other than their own , and actually dialoging rather than trying to dictate their views onto the nation . By then it will be too late .
Have you read the Old Testament ? In Numbers , God says do n't count any male child under one month old as a person . They also did n't count girls at all . He also had them burn Tamora while she was pregnant .
Actually , Darwin was much less racist than was typical of the Victorian British of his day . Possibly you should read what Darwin had to say about his encounters with slavery in South America . Nevertheless , Darwin was a Victorian Englishman and his attitudes were colored by that culture , where Victoria was , by the Grace of God , Queen , and the head of the Church of England , which dominated the culture and academic life of the time . You know , the slavery that was propagated and approved by the European Christian churches . And , of course , the slave trade in the U.S. was supported and approved by the protestant churches . The Southern Baptist Convention was formed for the sole purpose of excluding blacks from the Christian churches . In 1997 the Southern Baptist Convention issued an official apology to African Americans for its history of racism . Of course , you are probably quite aware that the KKK was fromed by southern Christians - still is . There is also the Aryan Brotherhood , which also claims to be Christian . So I guess we could call that proof of the racism of Christianity . Of course you will squeal and cry about it and offer excuses , but facts are facts .
She is still a very loud activist .
Yes , a domestic bitch will eat a weak pup . Odlly enough wild dogs rarely do this ( the exception is generally a pup that either will not survive or in cases weher ethere is not enough food available to sustain the enitre litter , which generally menas the pup will not survive anyway . Basically , the only time that wild dogs generally kill their own young is in the case of mercy killings ) . As far as learned behaviors , we are high level primates , no more , no less .
Oh , you mean unlike the pro-life organizations that regularly refer women that come to them to pro-choice organizations ? I 'm being facetious , to get it out of my system , but seriously why would a `` pro-choice '' organization refer people to a `` pro-life '' organization when such organizations are regarded ( rightly or wrongly ) as `` pro-paternalism '' ? The claim that `` the so called `` pro-choice movement is in fact in favour of only one choice '' is certainly a important criticism that the pro-choice movement faces , because it is about supporting a woman 's choice to have an abortion . Unfortunately so much time and attention is devoted to protecting that choice that it overshadows the whole point of the pro-choice position : the woman 's right to choose . Too little time and attention is spent protecting a woman 's autonomy in making that choice or supporting a woman 's choice not to have an abortion . Fortunately in Canada , where abortion is legal , the pro-choice movement is quickly recognizing that providing women with the information and support to make an informed decision either way is just as important as providing the means to exercise one choice . I 'm pointing this out because I think you may be mistaking the pro-choice 's struggle to keep the abortion option open with what the pro-choice movement is actually in favour of : the informed choice of a woman with regard to how she wants to deal with pregnancy .
Wait , did you really ask a question imply an answer and then condemn someone for it ? Haha , your logic may be more delusional than I thought .
Actually people 's concept of what a marriage is changes along with societal roles . It 's a natural progression , an evolution of sorts . As the roles of parents , partners and the elderly change in society so does the concept of what makes a marriage . It 's completely normal and natural . Get a grip .
When I shooting pin and jug shoots it was common to have a thousand each of .45ACP , .44SPL and .40 S & amp ; W. Let us not forget the 3 unannounced visits per year from the boyos of Waco . At what time do you think they would be visiting ? Working hours so the chance exists of no one home ? Or in the dark of night to catch one asleep . What sort of visit do you expect . A polite knock on the door and wait for an answer ? Or perhaps a crashing down of the door with a no knock entry ? Thanks but no thanks .
Drugs and guns are not comparable , as you are n't guaranteed the right to use drugs by the Bill of Rights . It 's not teaching students to be `` responsible '' , it 's illegally and wrongfully denying a target group of students the right to own a legitimate item that the Bill of Rights says you can own . Not only is this policy wrong , but it 's an infringement on Student Rights and should n't even be tolerated . Your idea of `` responsibility '' is BS . Responsible people can be trusted with guns . Reminds me of a quote emailed to Easyrider in another thread : If a conservative does n't like guns , he does n't buy one . If a liberal does n't like guns , he wants them all banned .
And wayyyyy back when they were legally able to defend themselves to .
Among other things , generally adaptions to a colder environment . As for your theory as a whole , does n't the whole 15 , 000 year gap between the extinction of the Neanderthalls and the development of farming ( particularly the grains youre talking about ) .
I personally ca n't imagine a time that it would be absolutly necessary to kill a child , though there is a lot out there that I ca n't imagine happening that does .
Distract ? No . If Wells is accusing equivocation , he 'd better be able to back up his claim .
No it does n't . It tells us that creationists are either liars of very sloppy in gathering samples . I suspect that you 've been duped again , and as usual , nothing but assertion without evidence .
And if a black guy went on a killing spree and murdered 17 white guys and said he was doing the work that he felt Obama wanted him to do , what exactly would that suggest to you ? Just because somebody makes a claim , does n't make it the truth . What 're you gon na do when a life member of the Brady Campaign carries out one of these mass shootings ?
This is an incoherent question .
yea , I often forget ToE is a mental concept , not a scientific one . Nothing -- and I mean nothing -- will ever dismantle it in the minds of the faithful . Materialism is so entrenched in your mind that even if an animal generates a new piece of morphology by mere thought , sensation or awareness , and then passes that trait down to progeny , ( which has been shown on here ) you still think materialism stands . It 's an unfalsifiable mindset that you and millions of others have created for yourselves .
In the reality which the rest of us inhabit , the onus of proof is on the person making the claim .
And what evidence do you have that having two gay parents would confuse a child about weahter they should be gay ? Did you know that the same percentage of children that were brought up by gay couples turn out to be gay as children who are brought up by straight couples ? I would say that destroys your conception that the kid would be confused . I know a number of people who were brought up by commited gay couples ( admittedly not many ) , and not one of the ones I know turned out to be gay .
So it 's your contention that hundreds of thousands of firearms stolen from residences annually is just par for the course ?
A Nightmare because the Republicans have used the filibuster as a weapon to stop legislation . Over 300 pieces of legislation have yet to be voted on and nearly double that in the senate that have already passed the house ... Yeah do n't try to hide behind that smokescreen ...

Erm ... we are ? Levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are usually quoted as parts per million , currently a little over 380ppm , 150 years ago closer to 280 . In 1970 about 330ppm . Carbon dioxide in the Earth 's atmosphere - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia
So , if there was a way to know that that baby would be infertile it would be alright in your view to abort ?
into Mexico . Even your `` source '' subtly acknowledges that the problem is with enforcement of the law , not absence of it . You ca n't stop logs from burning by throwing more logs on top .
here we go Dan . your problem with the law is not whether its fair or not , its whether you can benefit personally from it . you have no problem with abortion because your not going to be the victim of such a law , but youd definitely have a problem if you were the one suffering from the law . Apparently you dont care if the law disadvantages or is unfair to others , as long as it does n't hurt you , you 're OK with it .
That is n't the arguement your buddy made . He claimed guns could be controlled by dogs and snakes and stuff like that . Do you have any examples of dogs or snakes controlling drugs and going on rampages and blowing folks heads off ? Even claimed the dog was mournful for his bereaved master . He did n't mention how the snake felt Also said something about robots and guns but did n't have any examples to wow us with . Do you ?
Because this is the truth . Pure and simple .
But there is no evidence that it did not come about by natural processes . And , there is , in fact , evidence of natural processes that may have resulted in life . Just because you do n't understand it does n't make it so .
I know that . And it does not say when a fetus becomes a human being .
Did I say rationalize ? I said justify . You , me and everyone rationalizes just about everything we do ... If you do n't then I guess you live on pure emotion ?
I 'm not sure where anyone said it related to evolution , the big bang , etc. , but I might have missed something .
Well we assume a right to your own body here . It is also important for you to justify why there should be a difference in human and person and then justify why doing so this time is different from when this was previously done in history . I guess I do n't agree with the idea that you have no rights until you can prove you should have them ... if this is the standard then we are all in trouble .
You/he could just have said 'slippery slope ' in the first place ; that argument is an old one , which I though was dealt with a long time ago . You ca n't disapprove of A on the grounds that it might lead to B - firstly because you have little to no evidence that it will , secondly because A is not necessary for B to happen and thirdly because that difference between A and B is all the argument you need to prevent B but be in favour of A . You can approve of punishing criminals but be against the death sentance .
Because the rights to firearms are bestowed by God . Not by a king , not by a government , not by a judge , not by a group of men . The right to firearms are given to you in the same way as the right to reproduce , the right of freedom of thought , the right of speech , the right to vote . The privildge to drive is given by the state .
Oh yea , you need to retake math ! Since when is 10^-93 = 0 ? Oh , and you really should support your numbers . Odds are , they 're bogus Creationist BS .
Actually true . But I fail to understand the point . mtDNA from Neandertals seems to indicate that they are not ancestral and did not interbreed with modern humans . Neither are mammoths ancestral to modern elephants . In both cases the evidence indicates that they are related species . What was your point ?
Just because people have all sorts of views on the subject does not mean that there is n't a right answer .
So you have no problem with UK gun laws ? Your hypothetical is just that - hypothetical . In reality , a militia would stand small chance against military might .
What did I just get through saying ?
Well I 'm not trying to play it off as something it 's not , I 'm trying to keep people like Galileo from making stupid and untrue points .
Not true . I googled `` helpful mutation '' and got a nice list of examples . I wish creationists would do some research before making wild assertions .
I believe he was being sarcastic .
a ) `` Evolutionism '' is not widely accepted by scientists , it does n't even mean anything . It can mean atheism , it can mean biology , it can mean geology , or it can mean astrophysics . b ) Something being widely accepted by scientists does not make it a science - for example scientists in the 18th century widely believed in god , this did not make god a `` science '' .
So basically your story is worthless . You ca n't show an omnipotent or omnipresent power to exist . You ca n't show how the power works . You ca n't show the power in action . Science is more than just having a story which can fit the facts .
Jyoshu pretty much answered for me so I wo n't go back but I will say that your morality is formed based on arbitrary things as well . Whether you believe in a god or make yourself god you still are making arbitrary rules for which you develop a morality . The idea that you do n't want to suffer and therefore came up with this morality is abritrary as everything we have stated . Why was n't the conclusion `` I dont ' want to suffer so be stronger than everyone else '' or `` I do n't want to suffer so do n't associate with anyone else '' . Or maybe the conslusion could be to believe in a religion . Either way , you are going to have to believe in something and that forms the basis for a morality .
No you 're not . You do n't actually know what you are talking about , do you ? You got all of that claptrap in church , did n't you ?
You contradict yourself . If the earth was then much as it is today , then there is n't enough water on earth to cover it in any fashion . I have done the math . Do you have any idea of how high the Himalayas , the Alps , the Andes , and the Rockies are ? Besides , the Bible talks about a flood that lasted a year , not a series of tsunamis .
Oh yeah , sure , your rights have been violated by companies requiring you to work 40 hours a week ! Would somebody be so good as to call the ACLU for Brady so he can get a lawsuit going which claims that having to work is a violation of his fundamental human rights and is unconstitutional ?
Well since the Jews killed in the holocaust where kill under German legislation they where not murdered either .
Mythology . But nevertheless , shipbuilding has been going on for a lot longer than 500 years . There have been a lot of skilled shipbuilders who have passed along their knowledge from generation to generation . Do you think that every time someone builds a ship that they invent the whole process ? Nah . 300 ft is about the limit for wood no matter how you design it . Even worse it you cast a big box adrift in a huge storm . How did the animals survive the rolling and rolling ?
This is an answer based on either BS or ignorance . Those without money can use Medicare or Medicaid to virtually pay for the entire pregnancy . WIC also supplements your own feeding IIRC with proteins and calcium products . I 've known several people ( including hard core conservatives ) who 've had to go this route 'because they could n't afford a pregnancy ' . And if your morality/ ethics prevents you from taking gov't funding , think of it as stuff you already paid for with taxes ( now and later ) , you 're just getting some of what you put in back . Furthermore , there are several agencies that would easily pay for all your needs provided you put the child up for adoption .
Only one innocent bled in this case .
More appropriate it would be to ask when will the media stop making the shooters famous by putting their pictures , family life history and all kinds of information about them in print and electronic media ? The shooters seem to be getting non-ending obituaries while the victim 's names are soon forgotten . All the media is doing is encouraging a repeat of massacres that have been publicized before , making one more sick person an infamous character ... and that 's all the shooter really wants ... to be famous . Shame on the media . Perhaps a federal law bordering on censorship is required .
You are making a crucial mistake ... you are assuming there is a black and white line dividing the living from the non-living . This is a grey area . What is life ? Is a dog alive ? What about the fleas on the dog ? What about the bateria on the fleas ? What about the virus in the dog ? Is a virus a non-living organism since it can not reproduce in a conventional manner ? When you look at it critically , there is no living/non-living line . It is easy to see a gradation from what can be reasonably called non-living to what can reasonably called `` living '' .
So again we 're back to the idea that a baby magically becomes a person the instant he or she exists the birth canal , and only then does it actually have the right to be 'owed ' it 's life . Or is it when the cord the cut ?
But there are ample known causes for such novelty as is required by evolution . Mutation induced by chemical or energetic interference , recombination through sexual reproduction - surely you are not suggesting that these processes do not occur ?
Oh get over yourself and your self delusional narrow fundamentalist mentality ... . I thought monogamy was a positive thing was it not ? Oh that 's right it does n't matter about two people loving one another . Two consensual adults being able to express their love in a private ceremony and having that love protected under the law ... .
You know what they mean , I know what they mean , but as someone involved in teaching evolution to high school kids I wish they 'd avoid the implication of purposeful change and just refer to beak size changing in response to new selective pressure . As I said , I may just be being nit-picky . Language apart , this is another nice example of evolutionary change happening right before our eyes .
Oh my , where are these rights going to end ? Gun Groups File Lawsuit To Validate Montana Firearms Freedom Act Seems like kalifornia might be in line pretty soon
But those are only the book sthat were taken into the big collection . What about the other ones ? Or did I not read all there is to read on that site ? One of the apocryphical texts may very well be written by Thomas , the apostle Thomas . None of the writers of the four well known Gospels were apostles , right ? They were writers , heard the story quite a few years after and do not agree on all that much actually . There are definitely four different stories on how he was crucified for instance .
Indeed . And that fact makes the old creationist plum about how evolutionary theory is dogmatic or that evolutionary biologists are n't allowed to disagree with `` standard '' theory a laugh . Clearly , evolutionary biologists disagree and those disagreements are published openly . Science makes progress by questioning and disagreement .
I believe you have even debated that it is conditioned into humans to be religious and therefore it validates religions . So why is there a need to debate whether animals love if they are acting on a conditioned response ?
I think we are all perfectly happy to criticise Democrats for not standing up to GOP homophobia ! Let 's not forget it was Bush who made gay people an issue here . It 's your GOP that 's the problem .
End the guessing right now . Do n't guess . The meaning of the 2nd Amendment is explained in two documents : 1 ) The Militia Act of 1792 and 2 ) Federalist Papers # 29 . Both of which was written by the same Congress and same men who wrote the 2nd Amendment , the Constitution , and established the political philosophy of our country . First the Militia Act states WE AREA ALL IN THE MILITIA and that all citizens bring thier own weapons . - http : //www.constitution.org/mil/mil_act_1792.htm The more broader philosophy and intent of the 2nd Amendment and the Militia Act is further explained in the Federalist # 29 . - http : //federalistpapers.com/federalist29.html These documents are the thoughts and intent of the men who wrote the 2nd Amendment . So gun control slime are guessing or trying to reinvent history when they think gun ownership is collective . None of these documents anywhere support the collective idea .
The terrorists saw it as absolutly necessary . Personally , I disagree . When we kill children in Iraq , we see it as absolutly necessary , call it a horrible side effect of war . I disagree on that , too , I do n't think it is necessary at all .
And none of those explanations have anything to do with a magic being who made everything out of nothing . Science should teach currently held theory .
Well , in the case of a creationist , the bias determines what evidence will be discarded , what evidence will be twisted , what evidence will simply be ignored .
Here is the definition of pro : 1 : an argument or evidence in affirmation < an appraisal of the pros and cons > 2 : the affirmative side or one holding it You claim to be defending the right to bear arms . Yet you defend the very gun control laws that the gun haters want ! How are you defending the right to bear arms if you want the very same gun control laws as the gun haters ?
Oh , so now you admit that you realize that the book is n't an exhaustive review of his entire belief system . Earlier you wanted to use lack of information against him ...
Cite the books . As far as I know , the evolution of the peppered moths is used as an example of natural selection . You do n't seem to have understood . Again , cite the books . None I ever used ever claimed that it was proof of evolution .

No . The point is that doctors are more dangerous than guns , highlighting the stupidity of the anti-gun crowed who believe that guns should be outlawed because they are & # 8220 ; dangerous. & # 8221 ; Furthermore , if we wanted to include deliberate killing , we would have to include doctors who deliberately kill . And we would have to point out that many people who are killed with guns - should be killed ( violent criminals , for example ) .

More pieces of the puzzle were being picked up by other team members . Dave exclaimed gleefully , Look , its human !

'' funny , is n't it , how the human and the dinosaur are at the surface ! Should n't there be at different stratas ? Should n't erosion have kicked in somewhere in between the death of the dinosaur and the death of the human , some 60 million years later ? ? ? ? ?
I like that term `` pro-science . ''
Socialism is a very broad category of political ideals , which particular form were you thinking of ? And just so you know , Fascism is not a form of socialism in any way . Socialism does not have oppressive governments . The purpose of socialism is to remove the class differences in society , if there is a small group of bureaucrats enforcing their will on the workers then that 's a class difference .
Tell that to Ruth Price . The murder rate in DC went up 200 % after the handgun ban . It dropped 50 % in Florida after Shall Issue laws were reinstated . You argue that people can not be trusted with guns , because they might injure themselves in accidents ( hence the 4.46 figure ) . My argument is that I 'd rather take my chances than be defenseless , because I 'm relatively sure that I wo n't shoot myself or anyone else by accident . I can not say that no one will every try to violently attack me or my family within the course of my life with the same certainty . Stop trying to protect people from themselves and start trying to protect them from criminals .
And I do n't expect you to . The reason you wo n't go into how all men were created equal during reconstruction is because you can not prove that all men are not created equal .

Article 8 : In this article it once again discusses the optimality of the code and a few fascinating conclusions were made . For example :
No no ; again , you do n't get it . He 's only struggling because of people like you who deny the obvious . Rather than listen to what Majerus says about Majerus 's project , you 're listening to Mr . Mistaken Coyne and the author of the the Science article , which does n't say what you think it says .
Whoa , sparky . You said , `` A zygote is just as viable as a human being as a born baby . '' Maybe the word `` viable '' is what you and I have a different definition of . I say it means able to survive outside a uterus , without being totally reliant on umbilical blood flow , placenta , etc . A baby who is born is able to breathe and eat and live physically separated from another human being . Whether you think it matters or not is a different story , but a fetus is most definitely not as viable as a baby up until , well it varies - 38 weeks for sure and the probability is progressively less with each fewer number of weeks . I happen to think that distinction is crucial to the discussion here , because the body of another human is necessary for viability prior to a certain gestational age . To me , that is the crux of the argument . Maybe you did n't mean what I thought you meant when you used ( or misused ) the word viable . It 's a big word .
Really ? Why ? Bacteria do n't need to see to exist . They do n't depend on light to live . In fact , bacteria thrive in dark , moist areas . Why would natural selection determine this ability as being advantageous ? If populations of bacteria with the ability to sense light are `` better suited '' than other bacteria , how many different types of light-sensing bacteria are there ?
Let me get this straight . You are going on Plato saying that not beleiving in Zeus , Mars , Apollo , et al . is like a diease in the brain as supporting Christianity ?
Yes , as Ive been debating about for the last four pages .
Really . 'surgeons ' should n't go starving less , or should they . Like *what* was God thinking when he created man & amp ; woman as well as He did ?
Well before there was a law someone came up with a difference , I did n't ask if they end result was the same , I asked if there was a difference in the two . Maybe a moral difference or something .
you 've got to be kidding me . This has got to be one of the absolute dumbest things I have heard . You are truly one confused individual if you ca n't tell there 's a distinct difference between a living thing and a nonliving thing -- that non-living things are missing something that living things have ... . Just because this difference can not be analyzed , measured or defined does not mean it 's not there . You ca n't analyze or define your thought patterns , dreams , brainwaves or consciousness either -- but that does not mean they are n't there . I think you 've lost it -- You may very well belong in a mental facility .
If I call somebody `` male '' , that restricts no rights from them . It does n't require they go to a separate place to get their rights . And quite frankly , insisting on keeping one definition FOR A RIGHT ( at the exclusion of gays ) is `` satisfying the ego '' of the homophobic group .
Do n't those science writers make things so clear for you people who have no idea of what science is or how it works ? Actually , what is tested is the hypothesis . It is tested by making a prediction of a necessary observation and then devising a test of the prediction . Only when the hypothesis is supported should it be called a theory .
Would you like to learn how ?
SO the 2nd law of thermodynamics did n't start at the fall , but it STILL disproves evolution ! ! !
Sorry , taken care of .
JFriday : In fairness , no one , pro or ant-gun can ever use UK stats to support thier argument again . Back in Jan '03 the UK government finally came clean and announced that they had been seriously fu**ing with crime statistics . You can make the argument that the UK state had something to hide with guncontrol and you would probably be right . Reliable information from UK ministries should now be accepted as less than credible .
This is absurdity . I suppose then that medicine should wreak my body . How about viruses ? Am I destroyed by them ?
Try a google on cytochrome c .
Actually you are incorrect . I have heard this explanation before and at the risk of being rude its given by people who do n't actually under stand what is meant by `` testing a theory . '' You can not successfully test a theory . Once a theory has been successfully tested it is no longer a theory . When sceince refers to testing a theory it 's a process of creating an experiment using what they do know to find out what they do n't know , but it never proves the theory . It can often find another peice of the puzzle that when theorized can help support the theory , but that is not surprising given the theory was used as the experimental modul . As such the tests only provide additional information ( or education ) for the educational guess . Unfortuantly mathmatics and sceince use testing a theory in different ways and the layaman often confuses the two . In Mathematics it is possible to test and retest using different mathematical variables and come up with numerous examples of success and it still be a theory . The reason for this is that mathematics in itself is theoretical . By that meaning it is non-physical and can only be approximated . However such is not the case for science . I would not go so far as claim you are being equivocative because I think its ignorance not misrepresentation on your part . However , Thats the last I will talk about the term theory either people can accept the definition or not . Even if they disagree if they can not discuss within that frame work quite frankly they probably arent at the educational/critical level to discuss the concepts . If someone wants to prove me wrong simply give me a scientific theory that has been successfully tested .
no it does n't ... where do you people get this from ! If says you have equal protection of the laws but this still does n't apply to gay marriage just like it does n't apply to 10 year olds getting married . Good grief this is sad . Have any of you ever taken a class or read a book on the constitution ?
My point is the embryo and zygote have potential to think . Their brain activity ( none ) is completely normal for their stage of development . Infants dont know much , but their brain activity is normal for their age . It doesnt make them less of a human because they think less .
Demonstrated by your postings .
Most certainly . The fact that you think that it is unnecessary only underlines your ignorance . Why do n't you discuss beetle lungs for us . Those are organs necessary for the survival of both bears and cheetahs . How about livers . Same story . Thyroid ? Pituitary ? Pancreas ? Go for it .

According to Coyne and according to Mike Gene , the author of your article , Absolutely NOT .
Only an atheist is arrogant enough to presume to question why God decided to do that . The greatest scientist in history said about the order of the universe : The Author of the system must have found it convenient . Birds did not evolve one either . They were created with it up an running .

Why should I call myself that since everyone on the planet is as well ?
How can one `` defend the constitution '' If he does not exercise the rights identified in the constitution ... The 2nd amendment ... ..
Yes , in my view , it would be morally correct since it has no brain and , in my definition , is not a person with rights . However , if she does n't want to support the violinist in that future , she has the responsibility to disconnect from ( and therefore kill ) that brainless body before the brain gets transplanted . Otherwise , if she waits to disconnect until it is too late , she would be guilty of killing the violinist ( a person ) .
Socialsim and Communism in the Soviet Union failed because the USSR spent its entire existence recovering from war . The country was bombed to hell by Germany twice , around the time of the world wars . The united states put unspeakable amounts of money into their war machine , which forced the Soviets to do the same . I , for one , would buy a gun If I knew my neighbor had six , and he wanted me dead . The CIA and American military carried out immoral operations in 60+ countries since 1945 . The soviet KGB , as far as I know , has only been in Germany , korea , China , and Afgahnistan .
Beg pardon . I guess that after a re-read that did sound pretty pompous .
Well , I am not really going to convince anyone in anything - the info I placed in this thread is for consideration . Whether someone in need will decide to act based on that info - is his personal choice . Dry fasting is an alternative to the intentional termination of the first pregnancy because it turns this `` termination '' into a process that has nothing to do with criminal practices of modern days doctors . To make things more clear I will attempt to put it in adored by many `` good citizens '' terminology . The girl who is pregnant for the first time and enters the dry fasting kind of `` asks the God for forgiveness '' . It 's not a secret to anyone that young people do make mistakes , and often that happens just because there were neither parents no society who was able to teach them some basic things about sex and elementary spiritual safety practices . Even a fool can understand that , why would n't a God ? One can think of it as if the girl asks God to postpone her time of having a child : there is no killing , no crime . When the embryo dissolves a human has no relation to this process , it is the decision of the organism , it is the decision of those Above . And in case of a first pregnancy this decision is : the soul of a baby goes back , it may have another opportunity to incarnate into the human body . In addition , such procedure brings a number of other benefits such as health - unlike surgical knife stories ... Vitalij
I find this a fairly accurate summation of the goal of Hitlers final solution. Of course , Brady , you offer no evidence of how widespread individual firearm ownership became in the 5 years before Hitler rose to power when it became legal to possess firearms again . One would think that your argument would have at least considered this factorbut I wont fault you because all you have done is borrowed an un-sourced argument . Brady , this is just more cut and paste , this time largely from the website guninformation.org . For example , the statement
i 'm truly sorry to hear about your pain and i hope your recovery comes soon . i think the most popular justification people give for their atheism ( i 'm not saying youre an atheist ) is `` if God exist , why is their so much pain/suffering/ [ negativity ] '' . this justification apeals to the majority of `` layman '' ateists more than anything else last week my wife took our 2-year old son to the store . on the way back , just as they were coming to the entrance of our building , she let go of his hand so he could run ahead inside . instead , he ran down the sidewalk , between 2 parked cars and into the street . at the same time a car was coming up the street , didnt even see our son , and never even slowed down . when my wife ran out to get him , he had stayed close to the parked car and out of the way . had he run into the street he would have vry likely been killed . this somehow miraculous escape from tragedy has strengthened my wife 's faith in God strange enough , if ( God forbid ) things had gone wrong and our son had stopped in the middle of the street , it is very likely that she would question God 's existence . this is also the reason why atheism is more like a religion . through emotional experiences , rather than deduction and reasoning , people decide whether God exists or not . it also has to do with perception , since there are christians who suffer afflictions similar to yours , and it only strengthens their faith . yes , emotional stimuli affect all of us , usually with more impactful effects than physical trauma . and yes , we expect a God of spiritual power to appeal to us at least in the emotional sense ( since it is the only form of contact believers have with God anyway ) , and if God can not be there on an emotional level , then is he really there at all ? i think its incorrect to determine that God exists ( or not ) solely on the tragedy that we experience . a miraculous escape from death does not strengthen the case for God 's existence . likewise , a devastating tragedy does not strengthen the case for his non-existence
Which , we suppose , in your mind releases the sperm donor of any responsibility whatsoever , right ? Is n't it interesting that your solution for the abortion issue demands that women deny their sexuality while permitting men to run the gamut of theirs . Does this attitude , of which you are not the only proponent , stem from a hatred or a fear of women ?
You are assuming that the TOE of evolution has remained static since Darwins time . I have to say that is false . We have 150 years of experimental data beyond that . In addition , we not only have the arguement from homology , but we have genetic data to back it up . So sorry , but you struck out .
Because they would not be performing homosexual acts any longer . homosexual : of , relating to , or characterized by a tendency to direct sexual desire toward another of the same sex God takes away wrongful desires . Therefore , someone who was previously `` homosexual '' would not be considered `` homosexual '' anymore .
But , there is no 'fall from Grace ' . And it seems what 'sin ' is depends on who you talk to . SO , Yes , the rest follows .
Dunno . It 's not like any evidence has ever been presented , so how can we say ?
I think one blob attatched to another blob , and then those blobs joined together to create a group of blobs ... scientifically speaking .
I think her point was that the pope is biased because he 's catholic .
I 'm a little confused by this and it seems you may be confused yourself . If you have so much doubt about your decision then perhaps you are n't making the correct one . Often times people conflict with what they want and what they know to be right . I really hate how some pro-lifers go around talking hate to people that have abortions ... .yes it is wrong but so is making someone feel worthless . Regardless of what a pro-lifer does , abortion is still going to be wrong ... I think many people miss this point . If some pushy , arrogant , selfish , a-hole came up to me and started preaching to me how theft is wrong I would probably be turned off by him but I would still have to realize that it is n't these people that decide what is wrong ... .right and wrong just are what they are ( an absolute if you will ) . Since you do n't believe in a God you say you trust your heart . I can advise that you should be careful of this as some tend to make their heart believe what is right is what they want ... .a foolish mistake . Anyway , it seems like we are all trying to suck to you here ... I doubt you will change your mind but it seems you are confused and should probably give it another week atleast . Hope this helps ... if you wanted any help that is
Really ? Except for that one point , I believe I got it entirely right .
How do we know anything for sure ? We ca n't be certain of the Earth 's age in billions of years , but we can use carbon dating to figure out it 's older then 55,000 years , which refutes creationism .
And the introductory paragraph is interesting also .
Feel free samiinh . After all , chemist asked me the same question just yesterday pertaining to the same subject . And the same question about being angry at an allegedly non existent God applies to you too .
Not to derail the thread so soon [ cause I 'd like to learn and discuss as many reasons and basis as are out `` there '' for this position ( personally against but prochoice ) ] but ... . What do you mean by `` fully human '' ? Why do you think the fetus is not fully human ? Also , why do you place any value in the life of a fetus ?
So ? MLK didnt die by beer A Red Herring is a fallacy in which an irrelevant topic is presented in order to divert attention from the original issue . The basic idea is to `` win '' an argument by leading attention away from the argument and to another topic .
That 's kind of the point ... to morally judge would mean they that being is on the same level or beneath you . It does n't make sense for the servant to such a thing .
You can consider it all you want philosophically , you just ca n't figure it into science , not at present . It 's not as though Creationists have any idea how to test Intelligent Design , because `` Goddidit ! '' is n't a scientific theory . And no matter how much ID Creationists like to pretend they are n't all about god and biblical creation , they are transparent in their disingenuity .
We explained to you ( more than once ) that federal law ( which says otherwise ) always trumps local law .
Rationalizing ? I guess so , since I 'm trying to explain why it 's silly for it to be illegal . But , guess what , you are rationalizing why beer is legal . And you 're SO WRONG about drinking beer for 50 years . Drink enough beer to get a buzz and smoke enough pot to get a buzz every day and the beer drinker will be worse off . But you and I both know that all this depends on the person . If you want to limit it to a beer a day then I can limit it to one toke a day . There you go ... If weed is good enough , one or two tokes is all you need . You probably got WAY less tar than a cigarette and you did n't tax your liver with alcohol . ( You also did n't tax your kidneys and GI tract with caffiene . ) [ quote ] I 've lost 2 friends to weed and my gf has actually had a friend get his head blown off so you probably wo n't convince me it is a good drug ... . [ /quote } Good lord , let 's all go watch Reefer Madness everyone . Please , explain how you `` lost '' these friends `` to weed . '' If your friend of a friend got his head blown off , that had everything to do with it being ILLEGAL ... But really dude , you 're making this up anyway and it 's silly .
Ummm because those policies were enacted in an attempt to even out the playing field . I assume you felt it was already even and therefore unnecessary or is that an example of conservative bias ?
So creationism denies what God says in Genesis 1 . That 's a fact . I 'm a Christian , so for you , that 's strike 1 .
You jump to conclusions all the time .
If the evidence is so weak that you have to take classes on the subject in order to be able to `` see '' the connection , that 's not very good evidence .
Hummm , student athletes not all students . They got big problems .
Sure , that 's what you believe . But the Constitution is what this country is founded on , so naturally laws should reflect it . If you personally choose to live your life in accordance to the bible , that 's fine . But the Bible , like many other foreign documents , has no place in politics . Religious influence in government is highly un-American .
The other articles on her website are also well worth reading : Musings on Christianity , Homosexuality & amp ; the Bible
That has nothing to do with acknowledging or not acknowledging facts .
Oh the irony ... .
Whether Darwin did or did n't reason this ( and he did n't ) is irrelevant ; the fact remains that the evidence supports evolution .
And who gets to decide if it is `` justified '' ? Rest assured that the right-wing fundies wo n't allow YOU to do so for yourself .
Well let 's see . . . the last time a state started recognizing gay marriages , suddenly there was more support for a Federal Marriage Amendment than ever , Democrats lost more seats in Congress , the minority Democratic leader was defeated after years in office , a protestant presidential candidate carried the Catholic vote against a Catholic candidate , evangelicals in the country were energized , the pro-FMA candidate WON re-election even though his approval rating was 50 % , and the state that recognized gay marriage fell under a slew of legal challenges to the point where it 's up in the air again . The more you push you agenda through activist judges , the closer you get to the people having to pass an amendment . At least New York was smart enough not to do it right before an election .
So he `` overlooks '' plate tectonics twice ? He 's either ignorant or a liar . Some might say both . Knowing his other work as I do , I say both .
Richard Dawkins examines Rev . William Paley 's ( the originator of Intelligent Design ? ) theory in `` The Blind Watchmaker '' and takes it apart with ruthless logic .
Yes it does but I have a feeling that it will take the bulldozer of the SCOTUS to make the 11 dominoes of the old confederacy +Utah fall down .
Actually , YES I HAVE ! Not recently , but every time a cop has ever told me to sign a ticket he has made it clear that signing it is n't an admission of guilt , just an acknowledgment of receiving it . It is SOP for cops to say this with every ticket which requires a signature . And these cops said it to her also . She 's either stupid or was looking for any lousy excuse to refuse to cooperate , and then justify her refusal to cooperate with them which is why the Court rejected her argument and threw out her case ala they upheld her conviction and nullified her attempt to unlawfully enrich herself over an issue which she caused herself . Only a knee jerk and emotionally bent liberal like you would defend a scavenger like her who will create any bogus issue possible to make an illegal buck from a fallacious claim .
Why would gun haters like gun hater pilot say there are reasons to have guns ? To answer this a person must know that the only reason the 2nd amend gives to bear arms is it is your right to ! The 2nd amend does not say people must be in a militia to bear arms ! The 2nd amend does not say people need guns for self defense ! The 2nd amend does not say people need guns to hunt with ! The 2nd amend does not say people need guns to target shoot with ! Gun hater pilot will then later start saying since we have a standing army there is no reason for militias . Gun hater pilot will then say hey we have police to protect us , so why do people need guns to defend themselves . Gun hater pilot will then say we have grocery store so why do people need to hunt ? Gun hater pilot will then say why do you need to target shoot if you no longer need guns to hunt or defend yourself ? Gun hater pilot will continue adding why do you need guns reasons until the reason gun hater pilot said are gone . It is always interesting how gun haters like gun hater pilot apply the common sense lie to banning the right to bear arms . What gun hater pilot will never apply the common sense thing is to demand that dangerous criminals be removed from the streets of America to make it safe . The only paranoid people are the gun haters that want to ban the right to bear arms of law abiding citizens . Notice gun hater pilot did state if you can not trust one person you must suspect all people ! That is what being paranoid is !
Oh , you did n't read the part where he distanced himself from atheism ? The one where he explained that evolution is compatible with theism ? I guess you missed it ... It was only , you know , the vast majority of the book .
You might want to pick up a history book and read it . Try reading both the Federalist and Anti-Federalist Papers for starters . If you were familiar with them , then you would 've already had the answer to your first question . Your selective memory is at work again . As I recall , in Waco military vehicles and equipment were used against the Branch Davidians . Nevermind the presence of members of Delta Force which was denied , at first , by the government . Then they were caught lying again about using flammable tear gas which , ironically enough , is banned by the Geneva Convention for use against enemy troops . In the end , the 'open and shut case ' the government thought they had , blew up in their faces because of their lies and abuses . I also recall , at some point around the time of the Great Depression that U.S. troops were called out to quell food riots in New York , I think it was . There were a couple of young officers present by the name of MacArthur and Patton , I believe . There are a few other instances I 'm sure . I note your glee about secret agencies and their awesome firepower in which mere citizens would be defenseless against . Is your closet full of brown shirts ? You must be proud . Huh ? You 're for protecting yourself against other citizens as long as it does n't involve guns ? Of course , that would n't apply to the criminal that you 're protecting yourself against ! Why do n't you read how well your gun bans are working in other countries ? Regulation ? The only regulation should be mandatory firearms training for all citizens like in Switzerland . Not the 'regulation ' that you liberals would propose which , of course , always leads to an outright ban of private ownership . Why do you fear the 'people ' ? It does n't matter what you think , the second amendment is clear enough all by itself . Try reading the Constitution again .
That 's a good argument , just post a link and hope that people accept it as a real argument . Show me where a new body part has evolved .
Yet according to PP themselves , they provide FAR more abortions and EC services than any of their other services . : P PPFA Services ( 2002-2003 ) Surgical abortions : 227,385 Emergency contraception : 633,756 Prenatal care : 15,860 Adoption referrals : 1,963 ( Source : www.plannedparenthood.org )
Exactly .
What 's this ? Do we really get to pick apart the free will defense now ?
Really ? So because you do n't understand how evolution takes place it must not be true . Because you have n't invested enough effort to learn what you are talking about , it must not be true . `` POOF '' is a much better answer for you because you do n't have to think . You have the answer to every question , your goddidit !
So this list was a surprise to you ? This is n't the first time that the `` challange to come up with one scientist who believed that humans do not share common ancestry with apes '' has come up on these forums . When refuted , the goal posts move , and it 's shown how several scientists who do n't believe in common ancestry are dwarfed by percentages of those who do , with of course , a dose of ridicule thrown in . Is that how students are sometimes `` educated '' in today 's universities ? A false implication is made to belittle creation as much as possible , and if not questioned , is quickly built upon ? And if questioned , the goalposts are moved and the questioner is riduculed ?
Um , recorded and document Anglo/Irish history ? The same history that led John Major and Anthony Blair to apologize to the Irish people .
Well , assume God not to be a giant liar ... your belief requires God to practice deception , which contradicts is benevolent and perfect nature : Again why you put me on the ignore list . I highlight your theological contradictions .
And without a limited lifespan there would be no death . But we do n't live in such a world , so shut up and get onto a more relevant topic .
Well if no siege comes , I guess no harm no foul .
You seem to have a lot of hatred and animosity towards people who believe in God , is my faith and belief somehow causing you pain . I just dont understand why you feel the need to be so hatefull to me , at first you made me angry , but now I just figure you must be in some kind of pain caused by my faith .
Just because they 're our representatives , does n't give them permission to trample the Constitution and the protections provided to the citizens . Look at how many laws have been passed , only to be invalidated and ruled as unconstitutional .
Could you rephrase that in English ?
So tell us irreligious types what religious bigots and hatemongers really believe , since you obviously know better than we atheists , looking in at it from the outside as we do ... ..
Actually they already tried , see my previous posts . The city council rejected their ballot initiative petitions . Fortunatly for the people , half of the city council is up for re-election this year . Expect to see some new faces on the council .
Whether this has anything to do with marriage or not , it is deplorable that A PERSON who loves another person should be denied a hospital visit for any reason other than concerns related to health . The hospital staff erred in denying the visits , especially those of the children . The denial of the partner 's bedside visit is also deplorable . There is no legitimate reason to deny a peaceful visit from any friend or family member to the bedside of a dying person unless it would negatively affect the health and well being of either party . If it positively affects the health and well being of either of them , it should certainly be permitted . I think the hospital staff should be chastised and punished to the point of remembering this incident forever as a reason to relax their prejudices and get with the program . There is nothing wrong with gay/lesbian people that love and understanding can not cure .
So what you 're saying is that if ID really were worthless non-science , we 'd be able to tell because everyone would be happy for it to be taught alongside evolution in science class ? Yeah , that makes perfect sense Hopefully you can now see how far we 've meandered around the disparate issues . Let 's recap : 1 . Can looking for intelligent design be scientific ? One can apply the scientific method to any study . So far , the results of that application to ID ( largely through peer review ) indicate that it is not logically possible to positively infer the presence of design in a biological structure . 2 . Is the work the ID movement has produced rigorous , and are its results significant ? No . The fundamentally flawed assumption that irreducible complexity can not be achieved by evolutionary means invalidates all derivative results , and Dembski 's 'specified complexity ' is neither consistent , measurable , nor meaningful . Several structures claimed to represent evidence of design have admitted to evolutionary paths ( including , ironically , some of the analogies used in their literature in an attempt to illustrate things design alone can accomplish ) 3 . Should ID be opposed as a scientific endeavour ? Of course not . We only ever learn by imagining ; by striking out in unexpected and even seemingly absurd directions - just so long as we 're rigorous in our logic and our testing . I do n't think design science would ever bear useful fruit , but I would never oppose someone pursuing it . 4 . Should ID as it stands be taught as an alternative to evolution in science classrooms ? Absolutely not . It presently stands on a par with hypotheses about the 'electric universe ' , or firey comets flying out of the sun , or any number of inventive , potentially appealing , but utterly unsubstantiated notions . Its few published results have been obliterated in peer review and there 's quite simply nothing there to teach .
So basiclly the equal protection argument will help us based upon sex . There is also this at the end
No it does n't ! It cost way more money in appeals than it does to excute someone . WE the taxpayers pay for legal represenatation for them and us , plus the cost of keeping them in jail . The appelas process alone costs the tax payers millions . It is far more expensive to kill them than to leave them in jail with no chance of parole .
and
BUt felons do not have full first amendment rights , there are a lot of rights that convicted felons forfeit , and this guy knows it .
Explain to me how copying something is creating something new .
Oh My . That is the lowest number on the whole chart ! Murder and -- nonnegligent manslaughter rate
But I want to be fair to our government , and help America with this personal decision , on weather or not to become criminals . Here is what Obama 's government Website says on the subject of duties and responsibilities . The U.S. Government says : Human Rights
First off , it 's not punishment , it 's taking responsibility for your actions . I have addressed the men , this is what I 'm talking about , it was in my last post . Are you really reading the my posts ? I said `` They ( men ) should have to raise the child also as they are equally to blame '' . If I could take some of the birthing pain from women and give it to mwn , I would . The bottom line is that women know that if pregnancy occurs their will be pain , yet some do not protect themselves against it . Why would it then be my responsibility to take that pain into account ? They accepted the risk when the did n't try to protect against it .
I believe it is YOU who is being `` incredibly dense '' in your insistance of `` traditional marriage '' . No one has EVER said you ca n't have your `` traditional marriage '' within your chosen religion . That is your right . Yet you want to deny same sex couples their right to ANY form of `` marriage '' within THEIR chosen religion or non-religion , and also deny them the same civil rights you enjoy through your `` so called '' `` traditional marriage '' . No one is asking you to give up anything or change anything you already have . Yet from your elitist viewpoint , you insist on denying it to others . IF that is not prejudice , what is ?
Making abortion illegal goes against common sense ? I would say that making abortion legal in call cases makes no sense ... but ok. You also maintain that only religious people are against abortion ... I know this is n't true because many of my friends or family are not religious and are against abortion . Not only that , there is an organiztion called lp4life ( libertarians ) and many of them are not religious and they argue against abortion on non-religious grounds which is what many of us do here on the forum . Stop making baseless claims because you have a quarrel with religion . Your unwanted children claim is also baseless . There has already been a debate on this and it is very clear ( as he does n't respond anymore ) that abandoned babies will not increase due to abortion being illegal . Another baseless claim . I do n't understand why you just make claims and then never back them up eventhough you say you use logic and common sense . Is it logical to oppose abortion only because you are mad at a religion ?
Hardly . Obviously I had a lot more sense than you . My house and land is paid for long ago , I refused all credit cards including VISA and BOA and shun debt . Hardly a hack until is comes to strong arm union tactics who use force to chill public debate or frighten working folks in their family home ... unless they are public officials . I have worked mobs in an official capacity I do n't think you can enlighten me much on mobocracy . I think your whole problem is you bought the scenario of blame the messenger to avoid placing the economic blame where it belongs . What is next ? 60 's style Alinsky tactics and bombing those you disagree with on American soil ?
Crime has been dropping nationwide in recent years . Whoopdee do . There are some interesting statistics at http : //www.ncpa.org/pub/st/st176/s176c.html For example :
Well , obviously the past few years of reading around the subject and quite a few more years of software engineering experience all contributed to this particular light-bulb clicking on , so I would n't read too much into the abruptness of the final epiphany
I laughed when I first saw the ad on MSNBC 's Hardball tonight . It shows the fear , insecurities and the fallacies that guide anti-gay equality rights activists .
Painful ? Emotionally or physically ? Saline abortions are not performed anymore , you know this yes ? You do know that when the vast majority of abortions are performed the fetus either has no brain or does not have the mental machinery necessary to feel physical pain ?
And if ID consists of a body of work that you and an established special interest dont like , then its not good science ?
Oh yes it does . It is the subject .
So you claim .
Really ? Zygote `` A zygote ... is a cell that is the result of fertilization . That is , two haploid cellsusually an ovum from a female and a sperm cell from a malemerge into a single diploid cell called the zygote ( or zygocyte ) . '' Or maybe on your ( apparent ) level of understanding ... Cells and their functions . I 'm teaching this , from this page , to some 14-year-olds tomorrow . Anyway , by your earlier post , an egg and sperm cell should only be able to make more egg and sperm cells .
The statement was made in an address to the Pontifical Acacemy of Sciences in 1996 . It is clear that the Pope considers the theory of evolution to be valid . However , this is not a an encyclical and not a statement ex cathedra . Therefore it is not a statement of doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church . However , he is stating that , recognizing a restriction , the theory of evolution does not contradict Christian faith . He reaffirmed the statement made by Pius XII of that restriction . They is , `` If the human body take its origin from pre-existent living matter , the spiritual soul is immediately created by God . '' So yes . Catholics may be theistic evolutionists , evolutionary creationists or ID creationists . I suppose they can even fit into the other categories . I have known some YEC Catholics .
The biggest for our local LE . Our sheriff says almost all of his federal funding is tied one way or another to marijuana with almost zip for crystal meth , the current problem drug . And every local LE person I know does n't consider marijuana a dangerous drug . What 's funny is our state government outlawed over-the-counter sale of some of the primary ingredients for cooking crank in an effort to combat it on the cheap . Yep , all those ingredients are now smuggled in , reducing local retail revenue and we 've also experienced an increase of cheap Mexican crank on the street . Interestingly enough , OR is a state that allows personal pot cultivation for medicinal purposes by MD prescription . As those prescription holders are on record , DEA makes regular inspection rounds of their residences to make sure they are n't exceeding the legal limit of six mature and six immature plants . LE tax dollars at work . Everyone wonders how long it will be before the feds attempt invoking the sleazy interstate commerce catch-all to eliminate that states right . Since Ashcroft the Evangelist is no longer driving dark ages federal moral legislation , maybe there 's a chance that wo n't happen .
No , they just do n't 'fear ' in general , their fears are directed at something ( madmen with guns ) , and those that do find other ways to feel protected ( usually in society rather than being a lone individual ) .
That 's because it 's not a falsifiable hypothesis . No matter what happens to an organism , you will always be able to say it happened on purpose . The observations you cherry-pick are those you use when attempting to prove that darwinian evolution can not work . So you ignore the countless studies where variation is unambiguously stochastic and focus on the very small number which seemed initially to show non-random mutation . You ignore the countless studies where adaptive mutations arise , and can be elevated by carcinogens , in the absence of any hypermutational organismic response , and focus only on those where it does occur .
Or at least eliminate some of the competition from the workforce . ( A bit callous I know . ) War has historically assisted the economy although not completely . How many outstanding WWII debts are there ? I believe only finland has repaid in full .
Well I suppose it is a matter of having a rebuttal strong enough to assert proof .
That 's basically saying the Pope can be made into a murderer by handing him a gun .
Actually , the bird is fully feathered . The feathers offer insulation and of course , when impregnated with oil , buoyancy . Where did you get your information ? Well , no matter . You bought it hook , line and sinker . Did it occur to you that you should possibly check your `` facts '' ?
It takes a while but the Supreme Court did in Heller .
Anyone who votes for Kagan might as well tender their resignation .
I think the definition of human , in context , would be a person that is alive . Dead does not make them human in this context . Scientifically , human may mean Homo Sapiens , but there are other methods of defining humans . One of them is their capacity to love and to worship . Worship is not seen in another animal . Some will argue whether or not animals actually love or if it is just a conditioned response to someone providing what is needed . Either way , loving and worship are behaviors and as my psychology prof used to say ... ... . '' Dead people do n't behave . ''
Then how do we morally judge God ?
A liberal mainstream media does n't exist ... simply because it is not profitable to the select few mega-billion dollar corporations who own most of the mainstream media outlets here in America . There is only a corporate media . Not liberal , not all that conservative .
The pro gun-control side tries to protect individual rights from being violated by criminals . In contrast , the pro-gun side is more interested in protecting the profits of the gun industry .
Again , true . But that does n't take into account that there are two populations under consideration .
Just like Rosie O'Donnel , or Josh Sugarmann , or Sarah Brady .
1 . Two 2 . My wife and `` I '' named them . Do I know what they like to do ? Wow , you surely have had a terrible life . I know everything about my kids . What their favorite colors are . What bands they like . How much money they have in the bank . 3 . I was and am a great dad and a great granddad . I did do a lot of providing . And never minded blowing my money on youngin 's . I taught them how to drive on country roads in Kansas and my boy would fetch the truck when I needed to drag a deer out of the woods at 10 years old . He loved it , I loved it . My girl could drive t 10 too . Went to college on a volleyball scholarship . Now teaches school and raises her 3 babies . Life is good . When we get the chance .
And how many people actually do that ?
You need to read the whole article before you make such statements . The point of the article is that the provisions for divorce that are available to heterosexual married couples are NOT available to same-sex married couples because of the discriminatory federal law ( DOMA ) and because of state laws that do not recognize same-sex marriage , thus not allowing for legal divorce . Read the whole article and see what you think . Should n't all married couples have access to equal rights and provisions for division of property when they divorce ?
Really ?
Evolution does n't explain the event . The event is an example of evolution - a change in the frequency of alleles in a populatioin over time . The explanation may or may not be evolution by natural selection . You merely asserted that based on your imagined case .
actually , proof of something comes down to 2 things : agreeing on what the definition of the thing is , and agreeing on evidence that verifies the thing wind is defined as movement of air . air moves , therefore wind exists . this has been proven . i dont know what kind of definition you used , but it doesnt seem like your assignment is that difficult . God , on the other hand , is elusive even at the definition stage . he is sometimes defined as creator of the world , a higher force , all-powerful , greatest being possible , love , etc ... unless a definition is agreed upon , even beginning to prove existance is difficult . suppose we define God as love . love exists , therefore God exists . however , not everybody agrees to this definition . suppose we define God as creator of the universe . sciences states the the universe was created spontaneously , therefore God doesnt exist . therefore , for some , either this definition is not satisfactory or the conclusion of the scientists isnt satisfactory . finding proof for the existence of God becomes increasingly difficult when Gods definition gets constantly revised and adjusted . if we could simply agree on the definition for God then we could begin to find a proof .
But then , you are obviously scientifically illiterate . Why do n't you think that the panal of scientists who were hired to write the standards know better than you ? It is , after all , their field .
No it did n't , there 's no suggestions for how to enforce background checks to stomp out straw purchases . Stop offering non-solutions .
It 's not about how she treated cops . It 's about how cops treated her as an American citizen with rights .
I think your theory too simple . Guns make it easier to kill people . Do you think you have a greater chance of escaping with your life from a criminal that is armed with a knife or a gun ? `` From Dr. Roth 's study : The overall fatality rate in gun robberies is an estimated 4 per 1,000 -- about 3 times the rate for knife robberies , 10 times the rate for robberies with other weapons , and 20 times the rate for robberies by unarmed offenders . ( Cook , Philip J. , 'Robbery Violence , ' Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology , 78-2 , ( 1987 ) :357-376 . ) For assaults , a crime which includes threats , the most widely cited estimate of the fatality rate is derived from a 1968 analysis of assaults and homicides committed in Chicago . The study , prepared for the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence , reported that gun attacks kill 12.2 percent of their intended victims . This is about 5 times as often as in attacks with knives , the second most deadly weapon used in violent crimes . '' http : //www.asahi-net.or.jp/~zj5j-gttl/guns.htm
nah , I was just poking fun because I can ! Personally , this is n't a debate . It is a joke . I also think duo could be right that it is an evolution person .
Well , you must not be a GOP lawmaker or the President of the United States . They 're convinced that the only way to prevent the SCOTUS finding in favor of same-sex marriage is to amend the Constitution .
I 'm sorry , but that 's not what my version said . `` No one who has been emasculated by crushing or cutting may enter the assembly of the LORD . '' Emasculated = castrated Emasculation was not an accident . ( What this verse has to do with the death penalty is beyond me . )
A law baning same-sex marriage , then I 'd agree . But the reason same-sex marriage does n't exist ( other than Mass . ) is not because of law ; after all , there are plenty of states that do n't have same-sex marriage with no law that outlaws it . You 're barking up the wrong tree -- this is a cultural issue more than a legal one .
If not directly blame us , they would be screaming that the Right instigated or financed it or something . That is where we are now . The Crazies have take over the parties and corruption is so rampant , that this does not look anything like the country you , I , and I guess Doc grew up in . Now we train our investigators on the law-abiding , cause we ca n't trust even them ! About the only thing I can say Sarge , is Beam me up Scotty ! Everything is sure Bazaar now .
So it 's ridiculous for students to have the same rights to life and self-protection as anybody else ? It 's crazy for them to have the ability to protect themselves at school but it 's alright for them to protect themselves everywhere else ?
Were they able to show a previously non-existing code that mutated on a gene somewhere and created this new enzyme activity ? It sounds to me that this `` new '' enzymatic activity came from non-coding dna switching on a gene to produce it . That is what one would expect to find . ... *Two new enzyme activities , 6-aminohexanoate cyclic dimer hydrolase and 6-aminohexanoate dimer hydrolase , were detected in the adapted strains . * ...
Good pick up . Also , how do we `` know '' that the heat generated in these reactors is from so-called `` nuclear fission '' and not a heavenly gift to allow us our god-given right to toasters and ipods . The scientists had funny foreign names , so they are likely non-christian terrorists who hate freedom . Anyway , this nucular physics stuff is just another religion .
Almost all textbooks on evolution include the peppered moth as the classic example of evolution by natural selection . http : //www.clcoc.org/news/peppered.htm `` The peppered moth , Biston betularia ( L. ) , is one of some 20,000 moth species found in the United Kingdom . It became a famous example of evolution by means of natural selection . after the Industrial Revolution . The typica variety of the moth is white with black speckles and is a striking lichen mimic . '' http : //wiki.cotch.net/wiki.phtml ? title=Peppered_moth For years the story of the peppered moth , Biston betularia , has provided one of the best-known examples of natural selection in action . http : //www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/Moths/moths.html Although I failed High School biology I do remember that the peppered moth was given to us as an example of evolution at work . And it did n't show anything about the frequency of genotypes , because the population has been producing the same moths . If all you can show that a moth population changes colour , then again , then back again how is this anything remotely like evolution ? It is still being taught ... http : //www.bethtfiloh.com/biology9pepperedmoth.htm But it does n't explain much . `` Most biologists , however , believe that natural selection is responsible , though no one knows what traits are being selected or what factors in the environment are doing the selecting . '' http : //www.arn.org/docs/wells/jw_pepmoth.htm Another look into this is given at ... http : //www.talkdesign.org/faqs/moonshine.htm All that has been observed is that the population changed colour . They do n't even know why . Despite this , misleading statements such as ... `` The peppered moth ( Biston betularia ( L. ) ) is a temperate species of night-flying moth notable for its evolution of industrial melanism . '' http : //www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Peppered-moth are continually spread . ( http : //www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/Moths/moths.html ) Cited above argues quite well that we still do n't know why - all an evolutionist can say is 'it happened ' , and 'it happened by evolution ' . It is akin to Darwin giving examples of 'natural selection ' by referring to how man breeds animals . In other words , his evidences for natural selection comes from non-natural , purpose driven selection . Darwin said `` There is no reason why the principles which have acted so efficiently under domestication should not have acted under nature . In the survival of favoured individuals and races , during the constantly-recurrent Struggle for Existence , we see a powerful and ever-acting form of Selection . '' http : //www.tbi.univie.ac.at/Origin/origin_15.html The phrase 'survival of the fittest ' was not even Darwin 's . It was urged on him by Wallace , the codiscoverer of natural selection , who hated 'natural selection ' because he thought it implied that something was doing the selecting . Darwin coined the term 'natural selection ' because had made an analogy with 'artificial selection ' as done by breeders , an analogy Wallace had n't made when he developed his version of the theory . The phrase 'survival of the fittest ' was originally due to Herbert Spencer some years before the Origin http : //www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/tautology.html And this sort of thing continues today in modern textbooks . `` From time to time , attacks on neo-Darwinism are mounted , usually by persons who either see evolutionary theory as antireligious or who basically misunderstand Darwin 's theory . One attack , entitled `` Darwin 's Mistakes , '' by Tom Bethell , was published in Harper 's magazine . Bethell began by pointing out that Darwinian theory is a tautology rather than a predicative theory . ( The term tautology means a statement that is true by definition . ) * That is , evolution is the survival of the fittest . But who are the fittest ? Obviously , the individuals who survive . Thus , without an independent criterion for fitness , other than survival , we are left with the statement that evolution is the survival of the survivors . This indeed is a tautology . But it is possible to assign independent criteria for fitness . Darwin wrote extensively about artificial selection in pigeons , in which the breeders ' choice was the criterion for fitness . ( Many novel breeds of pigeon have been created this way . ) Artificial selection has been practiced extensively by plant and animal breeders . Here too , survival is not the criterion for fitness , productivity is . '' Robert H Tamarin , ( 1996 ) `` Principles of Genetics '' ( 5th ed ) , p571 .
I know what you said . I disagree with you . Scalia 's dissent was right and the majority opinion was based on the living constitution . Since I reject the living constitution , I 'd say that your assessment of Scalia is wrong . ReligiousTolerance.org is also a POS site .
and al shots in the ten range . And in response to Zachvac i mean guns not arms ( as in nukes ) but im fine with automatics and such in the right hands .
I think that while may be correct , it sounds too elitist to be accurate . Sane people do n't create imaginary friends to explain things . Most tribal religions are very matter of fact . While exotic or fantastic they are very material ( lots of talking animals ) , and also meant to be entertaining . They also incorporate superstitions , which often hold a few survival tips . Also `` primitive '' religions revolve around hallucinations , via shamanism and drug use . I think no body asked why ; they just got stoned and after they sobered up the human intellect kicks in an tries to reason if what happened was real then it must be some link to the supernatural . I know Judeo-Christian religions are anti drug use in most places , but in ancient times drugs was a very integral part of religion . I have a soft spot in my heart for that `` Jesus Raved '' T-shirt .
Almost , and this is why I start the entire debate from the begining . Your concept of God is the irrational claim , that leads , inevitably , to a string of reason based firmly on an irrational or illogical premise . This is no great feat , we can all make a reasonable mountain of claims based on a single irrational premise . You do n't NEED reason , you have faith , it 's the opposite of reason .
And again :
Will win what ? Against whom ? I was n't aware there was some kind of contest ...
Indeed ! At least you recognize the nature of your own statement .
No argument there . I was n't asked if I wanted my federal tax dollars to go towards same sex benefits in violation of DOMA .
Now this is a totally inaccurate generalization . I do n't think you actually realize the sheer numbers of people who smoke pot in this country , and I 'm talking on a regular basis .

CALIFORNIA : Legal with restrictions . Subject to certain restrictions , Section 12403.7 of the Penal Code provides & # 8220 ; & # 8230 ; any person may purchase , possess or use tear gas and tear gas weapons for the projection or release of tear gas if the tear gas and tear gas weapons are used solely for self-defense purposes & # 8230 ; & # 8221 ; . The definition of tear gas also includes pepper spray . The restrictions include a prohibition against selling such a unit to a minor , and a provision limiting the size to 2.5 ounces by weight . The misuse of tear gas in California comes with state penalties of up to a $ 1000 fine and/or up to three years in prison , not to mention a possible felony conviction on record . Some examples of misuse include ; using tear gas on people in anger , spraying it as a joke , possession of tear gas by prohibited persons ; minors , drug addicts or persons convicted of felonies . To be legally purchased , possessed or used in California , any canister must have a label that says `` WARNING : The use of this substance or device for any purpose other than self-defense is a crime under the law . The contents are dangerous -- use with care . '' The maximum legal net weight for a canister is 2.5 ounces , or 70 grams of OC , CS or CN .

Usually as examples of errors , do you have a specific example ? From TO Regarding Futuyma 's use of the Haeckel embryo drawings in the 3rd edition of Evolutionary Biology , Wells writes ( p. 109 ) , `` But it was Futuyma who mindlessly recycled Haeckel 's embryos in several editions of his textbook , until a 'creationist ' criticized him for it . '' However , an inspection of Futuyma 's 1st and 2nd editions of Evolutionary Biology reveals that no such drawings were included in these editions . In the first edition , Haeckel 's biogenetic law and the problems with it are discussed on page 153 in respectable fashion ( this corresponds with page 303 in the second edition ) -- and in fact the primary issue surrounding Haeckel in textbooks , which has always been to debunk Haeckel 's `` ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny '' oversimplification , is in fact admirably discussed in all three editions .
She only posts like once every 3 months it seems ... so it makes the conservation awkward .
Actually it just took GOD a long time to work out the bugs in his ideas thats why humans only appeared very recently . We are special because he took his time to gain the skills and knowledge necessary to build his masterpieces - namely us . We are after all the crown of creation meant to dominate all the inferior life forms and to take whatever we wish from the planet . Are we not ?
Really ? When and by whom ? I was n't even aware that it was an hypothesis but simply a mathematical concept derived from the mutation rate of the mitochondrial DNA . Possibly the time has been adjusted due to differing estimates of the mutatiion rate , but the concept is valid . Here is some information . Monty , I would recommend that you read the books suggested so that you might gain some understanding of what you are discussing . You continue to make yourself look foolish . River out of Eden is a good , basic introduction to the main concepts of evolutionary biology . For information on Mitochondrial Eve see What , if anything , is a Mitochondrial Eve ?
I think Ham is simply being disingenuous - he advances the idea that we all have the same evidence so that he can then go on to argue that indeed it 's a matter of interpretation and that it 's unfair to deny the bible as an interpretative tool , because he knows perfectly well that any fair-minded person will stop and consider the argument . But in practice , he and the people whose opinions he defends do not actually think like this . We do not have all the same evidence , because something that you and I and all other reasonable people will agree is evidence even though interpretations may diverge will be rejected as evidence ab initio . And that is my point - albeit probably expressed unclearly in my earlier post .
yes . But then you throw in `` reasoned faith '' . But then you are making up terms that try to show faith as reason . What is reasoned faith ? If reasoned faith is the same as `` reason '' , then fine , you are n't using faith . If it 's faith , belief without evidence , then your evidence is your faith , and thus , it 's circular . If your faith is even part of your `` evidence '' or `` reason '' for belief , then logically the entire claim is arrived at through circular reasoning . You can use both all you like , I 'm just letting you know it 's fallacy to claim faith as evidence , which you do . If you do not , then you are using reason , and not faith , and we do n't need to continue because I see no fallacy in using evidence to back your claim . Enjoy . I found this as well , maybe it will be worded in such a way that you understand , since you seem to reject my arguments based on my name . http : //rous.redbarn.org/objectivism/ ... /answers2.html

Sure I agree with it . The thing is , you used to argue ( not in these exact words of course ) that decency on the part of the hospital was n't required , all that gays needed to do was visit a lawyer and they 'd be all set . I am asking you to clarify that position now to see if you still hold that opinion or if you 've changed it , specificially in light of this event . Simple question , no gotcha waiting to pounce .
Either way it is a series of events that happened at random being explained by the results of those events .

Well be cynical if you want , if someone in your family had done as you ascribed you would n't be here to be so glib . Nor would the human race or any other species where penile-vaginal sex takes place . I guess all those years of biological reproduction show it .

And it will , I guess , take an amendment to deny rights to and make a whole segment of the population second class citizens .
Because a major portion of them are not as American educated and schooled in the Constitution and BOR . A quick streetwalk with Jay Leno proves that . I bet many do not even know who the sitting president is much less VP . Their concepts come from folks such as yourself who would deny rights up to the point of no return . Still you would say , `` boosh did it '' . Meanwhile , back at the ranch , Where is Old Sarge ? I have n't read a post from him here lately .

I think it 's fair to say that if there was no God , then there would be no gay people ...
Completely speculative nonsense .
This applies only when men strive ... that is fight . If a man `` Accidently '' hits a woman while in a fight and causes her to lose her child then all he has to do is pay a fine . But if he keeps fighting and hurt other people he gets killed . Even in the Bible you dont get punished so severly on accidents .
Well , we have our head in the sand in more ways than one .
Oh , probably about as many as there are killed by bayonet lugs , pistol grips , heat shields , detachable magazines , and folding stocks .
Source ? Children were regularly employed in the UK well into the 19th Century , and laws restricting child labour were passed as early as 1802 .
This bill is a long way from passing . Does n't seem to have great support beyond the `` plenty '' people you mentioned .
I think it best not to jump to conclusions about things you do n't know . Before you were saying that Bloomberg did n't even have a right to complain about what happens in other cities in New York . Now you 're complaining that Bloomberg is n't doing enough to interfere in what goes on in other states .
I think you are entirely correct . From the page VOR linked :
I think that is the most interesting part . This was n't just a lucky find . This demonstrate the power of theory , that it is predictive . Based on a prior theoretically understanding , they hypothesized that the creature would be where it was . As the hypothesis proved correct , this further adds to the validity of the original theory .
THE STATE v. BUZZARD . Buzzard decided 2:1 to uphold a law restricting concealed carry . But had the question been is there an individual right o keep and bear arms for one 's own protection , the court would have split 2:1 in favor of that right . So your mention of that case makes little sense if you are trying to make the point that Heller was not true to precedent . Heller was not about concealed carry , but rather the RKBA for self defense Of the 3 judges , only Dickensen interpreted the RKBA as did the dissents in Heller . Dickensen read the RKBA as a limited individual right to keep and bear arms for the protection of the state ( a right which does not encompass self defense ) .
I do n't know ? How about a person from a group known to do almost anything to get money , but also realises the pain they would bring to a child if they had one .
Well , there 's also the theory that the second amendment has racist origins . According to the VPC , the second amendment was written because they felt that an armed militia was an important protection against the possibility of a slave revolt . http : //www.vpc.org/fact_sht/hidhist.htm
Why do n't we do the same for straight marriages then ? Why does n't a straight couple that gets married in Colorado , and then moves to Virginia , have to get their divorce `` remotely '' from Virginia . Or maybe you should start thinking about what AUTHORITY Colorado has to grant a divorce to Virginian RESIDENTS .
I wouls also add that humans have been able to make CHIHUAHUAs and Irish wolf hounds from wolves .
LOL ! And yet you look both ways when crossing street .
Because when someone attacks the pregnant woman , she does n't have a choice whether the fetus dies . When she has an abortion , it is her choice . A woman should be able to choose whether or not she remains pregnant .
Well then there 's grounds for a lawsuit . Find a group of veterans and get them to sue the VA , funded by the NRA , and take the whole organization to court on charges of violating federal standards .
Well , you are apparently admitting that I am correct in that we do not know for sure . What God has to do with it I do not know , because I did not bring that side of the debate up . My argument is purely of logic and philosophy . Consider for a second that you are wrong , and that abortion really is the killing of thousands and thousands of people . Then is abortion a woman 's right ? Of course not . No one has the right to take a life for the sake of convenience ( I 'm not talking about aborting because the mother 's life is at stake , for now just clear-cut convenience ) . So you commit a logical fallacy by assuming women have this right , because you assume that people are not being killed , while you provide zero hard evidence that this is the case . So , once again you are risking thousands and thousands of lives based on a hope .
Actually , it has n't . Phylogenetic analysis has no relevance to Occam 's Razor . Further , DNA for all organisms is the same until you examine specific sequences . It is n't that the DNA is different , what matters is the the sequence of the bases is different .
Since that would be me let 's go over my position and you tell me which parts are n't reasonable and why : 1 . I 've advocated registration of all handguns but not all guns . 2 . I 've advocated mandatory secure storage for unattended firearms , like when you 're not home . 3 . I 've advocated photographing and fingerprinting for all handgun purchases .
Well , if there were any evidence for it you could . Of course , in searching for the source of these quotes we find that they seem to be limited to creationist web sites . Nowhere can one find a correct attribution . Moreover , what Lewontin is saying is that science is not a matter of faith . He is saying that science rejects spiritualism as an effective cause and is limited to naturalistic explanations . In other words , science does n't operate by blind faith . I 'm not even sure what point you were trying to make .
Actually polygamy is about one man marrying more than one woman . It is a heterosexual insitution . By your argument , it is traditional man/woman marriage that is the slippery slope to this `` broadening '' of marriage . You do not see any same-sex couples asking for a legal marriage for multiple partners . That is the realm of the straights , and all of them is mighty religious , as well .
Well , I incorrectly assumed that anyone attempting to enter the discussion would at least have a grasp of the most fundamental principles . It is quite strange to encounter someone in this day and age who lacks any knowledge whatsoever of the mechanism of adaptation since it was explained 150 years ago . It is one of Darwin 's original hypotheses , independently arrived at by Alfred Russel Wallace . Darwin called this mechanism of adaptive change natural selection . It is based on a few simple observations and inferences . Here is how Ernst Mayr , formulator of the biological species concept and one of the evolutionary biologists responsible for the modern synthesis , put it :
I agree , but does another option need to be a deadly one ?
The basis of modern law is from religious law . If you do n't know that , then you do n't know your history . And my contention is that if there was no God , then there would be no humans for laws to govern anyway . I know , you do n't agree with that statement , either .
... in your own little fantasy world .
I 'm not trying to participate in gang debate , but well.. The population of `` people with heart trouble '' would only be in jeopardy if the heart trouble made it more difficult to reproduce . If reproduction is not hindered then there is much less chance of dying off .
Oh ? Do tell , what awful things have happened to Baghdad by the Bay ?
Then why cant you explain an unreflective fertility and abortion rates between 1972-1979 here in America or how the Polish fertility rate never increased after the 1993 referendum that criminalized abortion ? Prove to me when criminalizing abortion has ever decreased its demand . So far you havent only provided empty rhetoric . The pro-life movement thoroughly brainwashes its supporters to believe such jibberish .

So what ? He made a statement on guns clearly and was well killed by one in the end ...
That 's an interesting subject , I had not heard of that b4 . Did our bodies once produce Vitamin C ? .
Again , you are off the mark . This is not a reference to Lamarckism ( which is what I guess you were trying to say ) . Even Darwin observed that novel characters were passed on to offspring . And he was smart enough to realize that these were not characteristics gained from use .
I think this is rather simple . There will be a decrease in volume or quantity of healthcare services . This will not include time of doctors who mostly tell their spport staff to do yet another test . So it will mostly include support staff , administrative staff , equipment manufacturers . They will not necessarily get paid less , there will just be fewer of them . Per person that is .
Actually , he said he did n't believe you . Come to think of it , I do n't believe he has 32 guns either .

Picture an astronaut connected to a spaceshuttle ... without that cord he wouldnt be able to live . so is he really able to live on his own or is he depending on something else to live ? ? i really dont see your point .
Well , you 've convinced me already .
Following your link , Ive just been `` visiting '' the website of `` Doctor '' Hovind and his associates : I found it a lot of fun - a sort of Disneyland of `` creationist science '' . Of course the good `` doctor '' takes advantage of almost universal ignorance about the scientific foundations of evolution : this is a melancholy fact , and it takes the edge off the laughs I had .
His bias shows in his writing . It does n't take a genius to see that the tone is not one of balance .
But wait a minute ! Has n't science found that it 's scientifically impossible for Jesus to be born of a virgin - no Y-chromosome ? Why is he willing to forfeit science and accept the Bible in that regard , and forfeit the Bible in so many other respects ? Why is it okay for him to accept the virgin birth of Christ , and riducule anyone who believes in the creation of the first man , Adam ? If God could handle the Y-chromosome , could n't God also handle creating the first , fully formed man ? He calls Adam `` fictional '' on page 5 . It becomes more and more clear why atheists are comfortable with theistic evolution . If there was no Adam , there was no original sin , and no genealogy as described in the book of Genesis , only monkeys . Except for his amazing exception to science in the virgin birth of Jesus , he seems to allow evolutionistic pronouncements to have priority over Biblical statements . Then ALL the basics of Christianity , the nature of God and central New Testament teachings , including the way the sinner Adam ( one man ) and the Savior Jesus ( one man ) are linked together in Romans 5 , 16-18 , are trivialized just the way atheists love . No wonder they 're so comfortable with theistic evolution ! On the bottom of page 235 , Miller 's comment about `` just about any preacher I have had the patience to listen too ... .. '' speaks volumes - his cluelessness about original sin and many other things about Christianity shows he has n't had patience to listen to too many . But patience does n't seem to be a factor when it comes to his enthusiasm for Darwin 's works . He finishes the book with `` What kind of God do I believe in ? The answer is in these words . I believe in Darwin 's God . '' Sorry folks . It 's going to take more than a herd of angry atheists to convince me that he 's anything but a phony . I hope this thread gets some civilized responses .
He did n't pursue the `` master race of white Protestant . '' He was a pure Aryanist , genius one . The very least you could do is get your facts straight , but you probably like spreading this bullcrap on purpose . ( Seeing as how you 're an atheist . )
yea you 've rebuttled every one of my posts with rhetoric . How do you explain how The Computational and Analytical Molecular Evolution Laboratory is calling for a new synthesis based on `` biased '' mutations ? ? ? ? ? ? let 's hear it .
No , I do n't disagree with this , I agree with this , but this also implies you ca n't go around killing other people on the basis that they `` can be considered part of the mother '' under some worldview .
Well it was n't actually condescending but a challenge . Are you saying that you are n't up to it ? If you want I 'll start calling you names too . Is n't it funny how creationists begin that sort of thing when someone doubts their dogma ? As for thinking outside the box , I can guarantee that evolutionary biology requires more thinking and encountering of new and difficult ideas than creationism does . To study science no one begins by signing an agreement to believe only religious dogma or to reject any scientific fact that disagrees with the mythology of bronze age herdsmen . In fact , you make a name in science by challenging established dogma . Just think about the famous scientists . Besides , how can I speak to you on an equal level about science when you do n't seem to understand it very well . Anyone who demands proof has no idea what science is or how it works . Then shall we start with a discussion of the carina ? I was n't sure that you were familiar with the terms and it makes the discussion easier to use the correct terms . Without discussing these structures and comparing them to theropods and birds you really ca n't understand why it is so clearly a transitional . But if you do n't want the condescending tone , then you need to pay attention . Perhaps if I told you to follow with your finger as you read it would help . If you can call me a pompous XXX the it should be OK if I call you ignorant , is n't it ? Why else would you be asking me at the end of your post I claimed exactly the opposite of what I actually claimed . I 'll explain at the risk of hurting your feelings again . Herring gulls and Lesser black-backed gulls do not interbreed . They are reproductively isolated . They fit quite nicely into the definition you gave of an insipient species . So Herring gulls do n't reproduce with Lesser black-backed gulls but herring gulls can reproduce with American herring gulls to the west , which can reproduce with gulls to the west and so on until you get to the Lesser black-backed gull ( which do n't reproduce with Herring gulls ) They are classified as separate species even though they are at the extreme ends of a single population . They illustrate one way that species develop . There are other examples of ring species , the most famous being a salamander in California and a bird around the Tibetan plateau . So how about this ? Genetic studies were done of Brown bears from around the world . Their DNA was very similar and they seem all populations seem to be able to interbreed as far as we know . Except for the Brown bears of the ABC Islands Although they look like other Brown bears , the have distinctive differences in their DNA . It is closer to Polar bear DNA , even though the Polar looks quite different and has characteristics not found in Brown bears . But guess what . All these bears can interbreed , including Polar bears with Grizzly bears . OK . Your turn for a few insults . I have come to expect it from creationists .
So now we should be making laws on the basis that it can happen ? Maybe we should start rethinking our laws regarding sex offenders since all men can commit rape and just might ; maybe we should arrest them now and force them to register as `` potential future sex offenders '' ? By your same logic of `` can happen '' we should revise our marriage laws to define marriage as being between two carbon based entities , because we might one day make contact with an alien species that 's silicon based . Just because something could take place , does n't mean that it might , or that it will . A pilot could go screwball and fly a 747 passenger plane into the Statue of Liberty tomorrow , are you proposing we institute new laws because something like that might happen ? How far do you want to take the preemptive strike thing ? Should we make it illegal for people to gather in public in groups of two or larger because anything else might be considered a violent mob assembly for the basis of creating terror and chaos ?
I think he does n't really know what he means , I do n't think all heathens follow a particular set of beliefs , though I do n't know as many as I do pagans .
Forming something complex =/= increasing capacity and adaption Yet another lie here :
And from this we are to infer that Leakey doubts human evolution ? There is by now a huge variety of fossil hominids . If Leakey was admitting that it was difficult to be certain which were or were not directly ancestral to modern humans , this is no more than scientific honesty .
The goal of anti-abortionist is clear . The job of self restraint is that of each participant in their close encounters .
And to deny that there are no transitionals without having the integrity to at least making an effort to learn what you are talking about is ridiculous . There are lots of transitional fossils . Museums are full of them and more are being discovered on an almost daily basis . There are news stories that report them all over the place . Try reading At the Water 's Edge : Fish with Fingers , Whales with Legs , and How Life Came Ashore but Then Went Back to Sea by Carl Zimmer . It will tell you about two transitional series . Also read Taking Wing : Archaeopteryx and the Evolution of Bird Flight by Pat Shipman for the story of what we can learn from even limited transitional specimens and why . Also read The Mistaken Extinction : Dinosaur Evolution and the Origin of Birds by Lowell Dingus and Timothy Rowe . I found the book excellent even though recent finds of feathered dinosaurs have made some of the material a bit dated . It will give you an idea of how the fossil record fits together . At least you might learn what a transitional is .
But the belief that 'its gotten us far ' is itself a 'scientific ' type belief , in fact it has less proof on the empirical assumptions than the science itself . Justifying the validity of experience by experience is the intellectual equivalent of saying 'God must exist , because God is good and would not allow a world without God ' .
Pro-lifers are like slave traders ? What a pro-lifers trading ? Anyone who denies a human being a fundamental human right is a slave trader ... like a right to life ... ? ? ?
Not historical documents but mythology . Genesis is n't historical . To believe that it is takes a certain intentional ignorance of the universe .
And yet , our instances of gun crime are much much lower per capita than yours . Hmmmmm , interesting no ?
I 'd be willing to give it a shot . Except , you can not bring up `` right to life '' but can use God all you want .
How do you know this and why would this be a detriment to the species ?
HEY ! I resemble that remark ! As a textbook-thumpin ' ( bio ) chemist , I am outraged at your ignorance of the chemistry pro-evolution sham . Remember , we 're responsible for the Miller-Urey experiment and all of its subsequent variations . We 've devised ways to analyze biochemically important molecules without altering them beyond recognition . We 're the methods behind such processes as genetic analysis and gene cloning . Carbocation hyperconjugation , keto-enol tautomerization ... C'mon , `` stable '' radioactive decay rates where if we lose half after 5700 years , we do n't lose the other half after 5700 more ? It 's all just a ruse to save Darwinian theory . Hell , chemistry is the glue that holds biology and physics together ! You 'd better think twice about calling us a real science . We 're just as much a sham as everyone else ...
And if the state decides to keep abortion legal ? Then you do n't care if these `` gifts from God '' have a chance or not ?
I ca n't tell . Are you a Bush supporter or not ? ( Just kidding ... )
There are n't many christians then .
Its the reading comprehension thing kicking in . ... [ according to ATF special agent William Newell , about 17 percent of guns associated with crime in Mexico came from the United States . ... 5th paragraph
The cops do n't claim supreme moral or secular authority . Not to mention they do bust their own and send them the jail . The Vatican does n't do that . Also , the Cops do n't shuffle around known law breakers and refuse to tell the public . Also , the cops do n't glorify a known law breaker , they send the sucker to prison . While the cops do have their problems : they do n't pretend like they do n't exist . Seriously , was that some **** poor attempt at trying to get me back ?
What is incredible is that this is probably the most enlightened response I can expect from this crowd .
Let me rephrase this . Why do people think they have a right to vote upon some one elses life ?
Just how many graduates of the ICR Graduate School in geology and working in the oil industry do you think there are ?
Hello dierrier ! I would say you got your steotopegia handed to you in your hat I bet the shot men get out of the hospital before those women do and with less visible damage . Or mental either for that matter . Know how many lives are lost from medical mistakes each year ? Take a wild ( a word you are very familiar with ) guess ? You are over ten times more likely to die from a medical mistake than to ever be shot . Why do we tolerate this ? Just like guns , doctors prevent more deaths than medical error costs . Now these women will probably be doing the moon walk for a long time if not forever . Your chance of dying from a medical mistake is 90 times more likely from the hands of your doctor than ever being accidentally shot !
Science does n't offer proof . Are you so ignorant ? Much less can science offer `` proof '' of evolution by means of organ transplants . The idea is simple minded at best . since it seems to be important to you , why do n't you offer `` proof '' that evolution doe n't happen . Other creationists have already admitted that it does in this thread .
# 1 , There have n't exactly been a lot of presidential assassins , or gun weilding terrorists for that matter , for the Violence Policy center to be harping about . Where are these lots of terrorists and presidential assassins hiding at ? If the VPC knows and has n't reported them , then the VPC has committed a felony . # 2 And there is nothing illegal about being a white supremacist . While I despise their ideas , I fully support their right to have them .
So the only purpose of the concept of scaffolding is to defeat IC ?
I think according to your logic that the man ought to have the right to force the woman to have an abortion . If abortion is a legitimate means for her to rid herself of the responsibilities of parenthood , then abortion is likewise a legitimate means for a man who desires to rid himself of the responsibilities of parenthood . You have failed to show why this is n't the case . You have merely made a statement unsupported by any reasons .
But of course ! Of course you have to take into account all the input that any one system receives from all external sources in order to trace back to an initial state . ( No system can ever be truly closed , truly isolated from the rest of the universe , for what should be obvious reasons . Certain systems are only classified as 'closed ' for experiments ' sake because they have been very efficiently isolated and the parameters of unavoidable input are precisely calculable and can be subtracted from results , thereby giving the results that a truly closed system would provide . ) In your pool-shot example below , for instance , the initial state must take account of the wear & amp ; tear of the table , the strength of the cue , the slope of the floor , humidity , temperature and every other variable . So any such 'backtracking ' ( which is highly hypothetical given the extreme complexity of the calculations ) has to take into account the knowledge that no system is isolated . This is part of what chaos theory attempts to do , and why chaos theory must deal in probabilities until we have computers ordres of magnitude more powerful than we do today .
What are 'a levels ' ? Is that at university , or school ?
an image is not the original . a photo of you is not you , its an image of you . the image can not be or replace the original , and isnt intended to regardless of how `` perfect '' the photocopier is , you can not cash the `` perfect '' copy of the check . it may be a perfect replica , to the detail , but it is still only an image . the problem isnt the quality of the copying process , but the fact that the copy itself is just that , a copy , not the original
Now name one country with universal socialized healthcare with a population of 300 million citizens modulus , just one if you can . Your exemplar countries are tiny in comparison to us so lets get realistic and compare apples to apples for once , ok ?
I guess you failed to look at these two . http : //reason.com/0211/fe.jm.gun.shtml http : //www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,59866,00.html Here 's a little question ... . If you were a criminal ... . would you rather rob from a house where you knew the owner did n't have a gun or would you rob someone you knew had a gun ?
Does the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms permit the private ownership of handguns or perhaps ( as in the US ) grant a right to bear arms `` that shall not be infringed '' ?
Other states have made similar revisions . I would encourage people in states that have n't to push their elected officials to do so .
But if one can be a person without having unique DNA , then your qualification is at best incomplete . As it stands , it follows from your claim that monozygotic multiple births are not people . See my further deconstruction of your arguments in your own `` Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! '' thread .
Actually , it was a new color . The black morph was first observed in 1848 . That color arose by mutation . Similar mutations have been observed in the same gene in other species of moth . Nor is it proof of anything . And natural selection is but one of several mechanisms of evolution .
Sinjin . This is not an Anti-union rant . This is a DC police , and Township police question . SEIU Service Employees Union International . In other words , all of the people involved are employed by the Government . That means they work for us . The Police are employed by us . The DC Police backed the SEIU , and the article said they were there to protect SEIU . And maybe even worse than that , is the fact that the township police were maybe either afraid of SEIU or were sympathetic to their goals . And Screw that ! ! ! ! ! ! They are employed to protect the people on that street . Otherwise , we have anarchy . But , it is a fact that , Everyone there is employed by us . However , if this not be the case , I asked for an explanation that makes sense . But , if this be true , and if it is n't brought under control , are we then supposed to then fear our very own police because maybe they belong to SEIU , or hope to join ? Or something ? Or whatever ? I do n't know . Then who do we trust ? Whom can we then count on besides ourselves ? If that be the case , what do we need police for ? If the home owner does n't know who is the enemy in this situation , and who is coming to help , this is a tragic circumstance I do n't even want to contemplate ! Too much corruption for my small brain to try and figure out ! I can tell you that much ! Can SEIU take over law enforcement just that easily ? Are we subject to be held up by a Police Union ? I do n't know the answers to these questions . So I asked for help figuring it out . I think you belong to SEIU , are you proud of this situation ? It also turns out that the Bank Executive worked for the Clinton Administration so I am defending someone from your party . This is n't partisanship !
It 's interesting that you mention this because this was actually prophesied right from the beginning by God . Down through the centuries , women have been mistreated and often considered to be second-rate humans . This is because of imperfection , an imperfection that God could foresee : Your craving will be for your husband , and he will dominate you. ( Genesis 3:16 ) Obviously men are not without blame too , but ultimately , due to disobedience to God , both Adam and Eve have had to pay the price and so have their offspring .
And the Jews were the ones who got killed off in large numbers .
Hmm . . . a lot of these could also be brought on by sitting in a chair for long periods of time trying to make sweeping online statements that pregnancy is always harmful and trying to back it up with either temporary issues , worst-case scenarios that rarely happen , or things for which it is debatable whether or not it is truly 'harmful . '
If you had a look at all of the other threads on this topic you would see that .
Yeah - lets see how many fetuses get to leave that womb successfully when mom is starving .
As of this post , Project Steve stands at 703 Steves . The Steve-o-Meter 's visual representation is a little misleading .
I think you are probably right .
I looked it up and apparently there is a synthetic form of THC on the market , ( generically known as Dronabinol and sold under the trade name Marinol ) . But it is only allowed under restricted prescription ( it 's a Schedule II controlled substance , the same as morphine or cocaine ) and is far less effective than plant-derived THC .
In theory true but it gets convoluted when the discussion focuses on information that is freely offered by a citizen that seems innocuous but is actually incriminating under certain situations . EZ-Pass could be used to issue speeding tickets ; the authorities know the minimum time it should take to travel between exits . . . You do it in a shorter time and you are issued a ticket . You have provided the authorities the evidence of your criminality and the means to prove it - but is that self-incrimination ?
