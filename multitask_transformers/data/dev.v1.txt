I have never , once , seen a Creationist actually make a list of what the kinds are , and what animals belong to them . They will say there is a canine kind , to which dogs and wolves belong , and maybe one or two other obvious ones like felines , but that 's the greatest commitment I 've ever seen .	Actually , the debate on this one was hard to miss 8 or 9 years ago . John Woodmorappe , in his book , Noah 's Ark : A Feasibility Study , Inst for Creation Research ( July 1 , 1996 ) , 298 pp. , ISBN : 0932766412 did exactly that . Essentially Woodmorappe equated `` kinds '' to genus in most cases , with an occasional family that contained an inordinate number of genera thrown in where he could n't make all of them fit . Woody came up with 15,754 `` kinds '' , and calculates that there would have been enough room on the ark for all of them . He also calculated the room requirements based on the median size of the animals rather than the average size . Of course , he leaves off all plants , arthropods , mollusks , fish , and aquatic mammals . I do n't recall if he included the dinosaurs , but Ken Ham , Kent Hovind , Carl Baugh and the like have them on the ark . You correctly assume that the creationist story would be that there was a `` dog king '' and a `` cat kind '' from which all species evolved in a few years after the flood . Never mind that a single pair of cats could not possibly carry enough genetic diversity to evolve all 36 species of cat in 4 genera , not even in the 4,500 years since the flood was claimed to have occurred . In order to cram all the `` kinds '' on the ark , creationists must leave off everything but mammals and birds ( without ever explaining how they could have survived a flood that lasted a year ) , and then propose hyper-evolution at rates that make evolutionary biologists dizzy , calling it `` variation in kind . '' It should also be noted that `` John Woodmorappe '' is a pen name of Jan Peczkis , a science teacher from Chicago with a degree in earth science . Besides his young earth creationist articles as Woodmorappe , Peczkis has also published old earth articles in peer reviewed literature . At one time Peczkis threatened to sue several people on the internet who revealed the duplicity ( one being Joe Meert of the University of Florida geology department . Radiometric Dating , Paleosols and the Geologic Column ) . If he consulted a lawyer , I 'm sure that he was laughed out of the office , since you ca n't sue someone for slander if what they say is true . A review of Woodmorappe 's book and other interesting links can be found at Talk Origins . You can buy the book at amazon.com for $ 44.50 .	agree	notsarc
On this 35th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision , I would like to share my views on the issue of abortion . Life begins at the point of conception . No one can deny that after a human being is conceived it will develop into the very same being as those debating this issue . What astounds me is that those who favor abortion went through an identical development stage as the being they are condemning to death . Would these very same people agree that a similiar choice should have been made about their own existence ? Abortion today is used primarily as a birth control of convenience because people are too self-centered to take precautions . They prefer their own pleasurable self-indulgence over the care and sanctity of the life they created . What ever happened to taking responsibility for one 's actions in this country ? Is it too much to ask a woman who has conceived to place the child into adoption ? Nine months of discomfort is nothing compared to life in prison for voluntary manslaughter ! Does the father of the child have a say in this ? And what about the constitution of the United States ? Are not all people conceived in this country deserving of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness ? I believe abortion is a crime against humanity and should be outlawed . We need to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision and get back to cherishing life in this country . For a country that murders it 's children can not be far from self destruction .	You have some good points here , but what do you do in the event of pregnancy due to rape ? Or a pregnancy that is going to put the life of the mother at risk ? And to push the line a bit further , what about failed contraception , where the 'morning after ' pill is taken ? Does that count as abortion as it happens after conception ? Smiley	neutral	notsarc

PLANET OF THE APES THING= Unfortunatly for us , yes . And very likely if we just disappered . RELIGION THING= As I said humans follow three catgories , self-preservation , the soical thing , and the need to continue or better the species . We see in the very long term , and have high orders of reasoning that allow us to get what we want . That is how we got here , but we see death as something outside our long-term ability to plan for , and that just messes with the need for self-preservation . So , because we are creatures that need to have answers ( not because god said so , but because creatures that want the answer on how to get that peice of fruit up in that tree to fall down , will do better then the creature that dose n't care ) , we create eloborate teachings that allow us to incorporate death into our long-term plans , and that takes away from the whole self-preservation fear . No offense to religious guys , but seriously if you think about it , is n't it convinent that god will let us into heaven . Every culture has some version of eternity written into its teachings , weither it be heaven , rebirth or some nature thing it is what we want to believe . I admit in my weaker momments I have really wished I did believe in some kind of god , but the fact remains , most of our lives we act on complex instinct . The thing that seperates us now that we have got metaphorically `` Situated '' as a civilization is the few moments we walk in to transedental territory . That time we figure out the math problem , that time we figure out the riddle , that , more then anything , is the definition of consiousness I go by . Everything else in life , religion , love , hate etc . are just things we use to satisfy our base needs ( re-read my first post for clarification ) but those seconds , when we finally grasp an idea , when it dose n't change us in any way , but we feel profoundly happy at our own ability to grasp the riddle , math problem , board game etc . is something no other animal feels . They may feel happy at having , going back to the fruit in a tree example , knocked the fruit out of the tree , and are happy now because they get to eat the fruit . Humanity is `` sentient '' because we enjoy the fact that we knocked the fruit out of the tree more then we enjoy the fruit itself . Atleast thats what I think defines consiousness I could be wrong , but I know for sure what dose n't and religion is something any animal with enough reasoning and foresight would invent .

Third , the violinist illustration is not parallel to pregnancy because it equates a stranger/stranger relationship with a mother/child relationship . This is a key point and brings into focus the most dangerous presumption of the violinist illustration , also echoed in McDonagh 's thesis . Both presume it is unreasonable to expect a mother to have any obligations towards her own child . The violinist analogy suggests that a mother has no more responsibility for the welfare of her child than she has to a total stranger . McDonagh 's view is even worse . She argues the child is not merely a stranger , but a violent assailant the mother needs to ward off in self-defense . This error becomes immediately evident if we amend Thompson 's illustration . What if the mother woke up from an accident to find herself surgically connected to her own child ? What kind of mother would willingly cut the life-support system to her two-year-old in a situation like that ? And what would we think of her if she did ? Blood relationships are never based on choice , yet they entail moral obligations , nonetheless . This is why the courts prosecute negligent parents . They have consistently ruled , for example , that fathers have an obligation to support their children even if they are unplanned and unwanted . If it is moral for a mother to deny her child the necessities of life ( through abortion ) before it is born , how can she be obligated to provide the same necessities after he 's born ? Remember , Thompson concedes that the fetus is a person from the moment of conception . If her argument works to justify abortion , it works just as well to justify killing any dependent child . After all , a two-year-old makes a much greater demand on a woman than a developing unborn .	This seems to be the central argument : the article continues to give many examples of moral disapproval of neglecting or murdering your children . However , it ignores the fact that parenthood is a relationship which is not defined simplistically by genetic relation or by being in the womb ( it is unclear if he thinks surrogate mothers should be able to have abortions ) . We can be prosecuted for neglecting an adopted child or step-child , or anyone we have parental responsibility for . On the other hand , if a person gives their child up for adoption then they can not be charged with negligence if the child is deserted by its new parents . One interesting part :	agree	notsarc

Nope the defective gene is itself a mutation of the active form of the enzyme . And the mutation to the defective gene would occurr at random but would only be inherited in linages which have external sources of C in their diet . It is not necessarily the case that such a mutation would occurr in every species with high vit C intake please note . Why are you calling this gene `` defective ? '' It 's not defective .

Of course , no species of coelacanth living today is like the ones found in the fossil record . The fossil coelacanths are small , freshwater fish .

Riding a dead horse indeed ! http : //opinionjournal.com/columnist ... l/ ? id=110004653 Bellesiles Misfires An antigun `` scholar '' as today 's Galileo ? Oh please , just shoot me . BY KIMBERLEY A. STRASSEL Friday , February 6 , 2004 12:01 a.m. EST History has its fair share of persecuted geniuses , men who were ahead of their time and made to pay for it . There 's the hemlocked Socrates , the house-arrested Galileo , the exiled Rousseau . And to this list of giants it seems that we are now expected to add the name of Michael Bellesiles . Mr. Bellesiles is the former Emory professor who shook the scholarly world in 2000 with his book `` Arming America . '' An academic bombshell , the tome went against long-held beliefs by claiming that few colonial Americans actually owned guns . This set off a riotous public debate over whether the Second Amendment was designed to protect individual gun rights . Mr. Bellesiles was showered with prizes and media praise , becoming an instant academic star . That is , until his peers started looking into that little thing called research . Reputable scholars in the ensuing months tore apart his work on probate and military records , travel narratives , and other documents . Mr. Bellesiles , when asked to explain , provided ever-more outlandish excuses : that his notes had been lost in a flood , that his Web site had been hacked , that he could n't remember where he 'd found certain documents . The officials of the prestigious Bancroft Prize stripped him of his award , he left Emory and Knopf chose to stop publishing his book . Most of us sighed happily and figured that was the end of that academic scandal . But oh , no . It turns out that Mr. Bellesiles is still riding his dead horse , his nonexistent guns still blazing . Soft Skull Press ( which takes pride in putting out books that other publishers avoid like ricin ) has not only agreed to reissue `` Arming America '' but has decided to release Mr. Bellesiles 's latest response to his critics . This 59-page pamphlet , `` Weighed in an Even Balance , '' is a spirited attempt by Mr. Bellesiles to turn himself into the world 's latest misunderstood genius . As such , it 's worth reading for pure entertainment value . Much of the booklet is a repeat of the professor 's creative excuses and dissembling . He explains again about the flood and helpfully assures us that he is not an agent of the Zionist Occupational Government ( though surely that is why the Bancroft panel took away his prize , right ? ) . He does acknowledge a few errors , but only after pointing out that `` even the finest scholars . . . make mistakes . '' As proof , he cites one blooper in esteemed historian David McCullough 's 1,120-page biography of Harry Truman . But the most amusing parts of the pamphlet are those meant to support our scholar 's belief that he is up against a stubborn world that refuses to open its mind to the truth . And his sense of persecution and righteousness is very much on display . The very title of his book is taken from Job : `` Let me be weighed in an even balance , that God may known mine integrity . '' And that 's just for starters . The pamphlet is sprinkled with quotations from thoughtful men , all meant to back up Mr. Bellesiles 's argument that he is fighting the good fight . We hear from Isaiah Berlin : `` Few things have done more harm than the belief on the part of individuals or groups . . . that he or she or they are in sole possession of the truth . '' One epigraph recounts that in the 16th century , Oxford used to fine any student who diverged from the teachings of Aristotle . We are clearly meant to envision a feisty Mr. Bellesiles handing over his shillings to the dons . We are treated to lecturing tracts about the benefits of scholarly disagreement , the complex nature of historical research and the need for academic exploration . And finally , in case readers still are n't getting his drift , Mr. Bellesiles sums it all up in his conclusion : `` There are those who rest their very identity on the notion of a certain , unchanging past . The vision that society is unalterable is not just incorrect , it is dangerously undemocratic , and as such should be of concern to every modern historian . '' In fact , the academic world is hardly a monolothic creature that resists all change . If it were , we 'd still be trying to explain how the sun moves around the Earth . Most historians and scientists are wise enough to realize that new discoveries or interpretations hold out opportunity . But before they completely cast aside mountains of research , they usually demand some proof . Mr. Bellesiles 's problem is n't that he 's misunderstood ; it 's that he still has n't given them any . Or as the old saying goes : `` To be a persecuted genius , you not only have to be persecuted ; you also have to be right . '' Ms. Strassel is a senior editorial page writer for The Wall Street Journal .	neutral	sarc

Court : Seattle police OK to stun pregnant woman By GENE JOHNSON & # 8232 ; ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER SEATTLE -- Three Seattle police officers were justified when they used a stun gun on a pregnant mother who refused to sign a traffic ticket , a federal appeals court ruled Friday in a case that prompted an incredulous dissent . Malaika Brooks was driving her son to Seattle 's African American Academy in 2004 when she was stopped for doing 32 mph in a school zone . She insisted it was the car in front of her that was speeding , and refused to sign the ticket because she thought she 'd be admitting guilt . Rather than give her the ticket and let her go on her way , the officers decided to arrest her . One reached in , turned off her car and dropped the keys on the floor . Brooks stiffened her arms against the steering wheel and told the officers she was pregnant , but refused to get out , even after they threatened to stun her . The officers - Sgt . Steven Daman , Officer Juan Ornelas and Officer Donald Jones - then stunned her three times , in the thigh , shoulder and neck , and hauled her out of the car , laying her face-down in the street . Brooks gave birth to a healthy baby two months later , but has permanent scars from the Taser . She sued the officers for violating her constitutional rights , and U.S. District Judge Richard Jones allowed the case to continue . He declined to grant the officers immunity for performing their official duties and said Brooks ' rights were clearly violated . But in a 2-1 ruling Friday , a panel of the 9th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed . Judges Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain held that the officers were justified in making an arrest because Brooks was obstructing them and resisting arrest . The use of force was also justified because of the threat Brooks posed , Hall wrote : `` It seems clear that Brooks was not going to be able to harm anyone with her car at a moment 's notice . Nonetheless , some threat she might retrieve the keys and drive off erratically remained , particularly given her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation . '' They also noted that the force used was n't that serious because the Taser was in `` touch '' mode rather than `` dart '' mode , which hurts more . They reversed the lower court 's opinion and held that the officers were entitled to immunity from the lawsuit . The officers ' lawyers , Ted Buck and Karen Cobb , said the officers made the right decision under the circumstances they faced . `` Police officers have to have the ability to compel people to obey their lawful orders , '' Buck said . That 's all the court recognized today . The 9th Circuit just applied the law instead of getting caught up in the otherwise unfortunate factual circumstances . '' The majority 's opinion outraged Judge Marsha Berzon , who called it `` off the wall . '' `` I fail utterly to comprehend how my colleagues are able to conclude that it was objectively reasonable to use any force against Brooks , let alone three activations of a Taser , in response to such a trivial offense , '' she wrote . She argued that under Washington law , the officers had no authority to take Brooks into custody : Failure to sign a traffic infraction is not an arrestable offense , and it 's not illegal to resist an unlawful arrest . Berzon said the majority 's notion that Brooks obstructed officers was so far-fetched that even the officers themselves did n't make that legal argument . To obstruct an officer , one must obstruct the officer 's official duties , and the officers ' only duties in this case were to detain Brooks long enough to identify her , check for warrants , write up the citation and give it to her . Brooks ' failure to sign did not interfere with those duties , she said . Furthermore , Brooks posed no apparent threat , and the officers could not have known how stunning her would affect the fetus , or whether it might prompt premature labor - another reason their actions were inexcusable , Berzon said . Brooks ' lawyer , Eric Zubel , said he would ask the 9th Circuit to rehear the case . `` This is outrageous - that something like this could happen to a pregnant woman , in front of an elementary school , at 8:30 in the morning , to someone who posed no threat whatsoever , '' he said .	For anti-choicers , it 's just about control and power over women . They do n't care about life . ( Except their own . ) This same mother could be a person who did n't have access to pre-natal care . They would n't defend that right either . Because they DO N'T care about the fetus . They do n't care about life . They do n't care about health . They care about power and money and pushing people around . That 's all .	neutral	notsarc

SIOUX FALLS , S.D .  In the fight to preserve the toughest abortion ban in the nation , the talk is not of a fetus ' right to life . It 's of a woman 's right to motherhood .

ADVERTISEMENT The bumper stickers and T-shirts that fill campaign headquarters spell out her message , in pink and blue : `` Abortion Hurts Women . '' `` We women buy the choice line . We 're panicked , or we 're being pressured , or we 're ashamed to have a child outside marriage , '' Unruh said . She speaks from personal experience ; she had an abortion nearly 30 years ago and said her life since has been darkened with regret and longing . `` If you do n't do your job right as a mother , '' Unruh asked , `` what good is everything else ? '' Abortion-rights supporters call such rhetoric patronizing and presumptuous ; they say many women find that ending unwanted pregnancies brings relief and the freedom to pursue other dreams . But they acknowledge that Unruh 's tactic is effective  and that it has thrown their campaign off balance . `` Historically , this debate has been focused on fetal rights , fetal life . We have a lot of language about that , '' said Sarah Stoesz , president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood of Minnesota and North and South Dakota . `` This adds an element we 're not accustomed to . It 's a different line of debate . And that is something we struggle with politically . '' The ban , passed overwhelmingly by the South Dakota Legislature in February , makes it a felony to help any woman terminate a pregnancy at any stage , unless an abortion is necessary to prevent her death . Women would not face criminal charges , but their doctors could get up to five years in prison . Rather than challenge the law in court , Planned Parenthood chose to put it to a public referendum , gambling that people would vote to repeal it on Nov. 7 . ( South Dakota law permits interest groups to refer legislation to the ballot if they can collect enough signatures . ) If voters reject the ban , abortion-rights advocates hope it will deter states such as Ohio , Indiana , Missouri , Georgia and Rhode Island , which have been considering similar measures . If the ban is upheld , Planned Parenthood will challenge it in court . Antiabortion leaders would welcome that battle . They hope the U.S. Supreme Court will use the case to overturn Roe vs. Wade , the 1973 ruling that found a constitutional right to abortion . Both sides call this election crucial and are putting out urgent appeals to raise millions of dollars for the fight . But if this is the frontline of the abortion wars , the guns sound oddly muted . Attuned to the values of this very conservative state , abortion-rights activists have decided not to make a stand on a woman 's right to choose . The big poster outside their campaign headquarters makes a much milder point : `` This law simply goes too far . '' One of their TV ads starts out : `` South Dakotans agree , honor and protect human life . '' The ad goes on to affirm support for reducing the number of abortions , but argues that the law is too inflexible . The only exception in the law states physicians will not be prosecuted for procedures `` intended to prevent the death of a pregnant mother . '' Even then , however , doctors must try their best to save `` the life of her unborn child . '' A provision allows women to use the morning-after pill , which can prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours of sex . But under South Dakota law , pharmacists are not required to dispense the pill  or refer women to a pharmacy that will . And the Legislature has repeatedly voted down a bill to require emergency rooms to stock the contraceptive . Walking a neighborhood of gracious homes the other day to rally voters against the law , Emma Tupper , 20 , made just one pitch , again and again . `` Our main concern is the lack of exception for rape and incest , '' she said . Some residents nodded and pledged to vote against the ban . Nearly as many politely said they would support it . `` Even if there 's no exception for rape and incest ? '' Tupper asked one elderly man . `` I 've looked at the bill pretty closely , and I feel comfortable with my decision , '' he replied , and closed the door . Tupper  who came from Seattle to work on this campaign  walked on , crunching through drifts of yellow leaves . `` It 's a tough state , '' she said . An independent Mason-Dixon poll in June found voters opposed to the ban , 47 % to 39 % . But a Zogby International survey last month , commissioned by an antiabortion group in Washington , D.C. , found that gap had narrowed to 47 % to 44 % . In another unsettling sign for abortion-rights supporters , four Republican state senators who opposed the ban lost their seats in the primary election this summer . `` I do n't know if I want to say we have a lot of momentum , '' said Jan Nicolay , a former Republican legislator working to overturn the ban .	Like they said in the article , you can have a campaign against marrige because it hurts women because of domestic abusers , you can say the baseball hurts men , because many of them get hurt .

1 ) It 's hardly `` solved '' .Same-sex marriage is not legal in France . As of 2006 , one same-sex marriage ceremony has been conducted in France and was declared void . France has a statute authorizing civil unions , known as PACS , between same-sex and unmarried opposite-sex couples . Same-sex marriage was an issue in the 2007 presidential election , with the Conservative UMP opposing it and the Socialist Party supporting it , though both candidates support civil unions ( PACS ) . ... . On June 5 , 2004 , former Green Party presidential candidate Noël Mamère , Mayor of the Bordeaux suburb of Bègles , conducted a same-sex marriage ceremony for two men , Bertrand Charpentier and Stéphane Chapin . Mamère claimed that there was nothing in French law to prohibit such a ceremony , and that he would appeal any challenge to the European Court of Human Rights . French Justice Minister Dominique Perben had stated that such unions would be legally void , and called for judicial intervention to halt the ceremony.Same-sex marriage in France - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia What France has is `` well , both the blacks and the whites can enter by the side-door , but only the whites can enter by the main door '' We would n't find such an `` acommodation '' satisfactory for blacks . And furthermore , I think you would find that it 's the ANTI-GAYS who have the problem with this . If Obama is able to try to put up `` civil unions '' on the federal level , you can bet dollars to doughnuts it will be the religious right who fight him . Not the gays ...	If same sex couples are offered equal rights under a PACS ( or some other legally recognized union ) as married couples , why does it matter which `` door '' they come in through ?

Another thing that is quite clear ( or at least should be ) is that there will never be a way to `` fight '' TOE with God - it 's just not gon na happen ... ever .

Wrong answer , an evolutionist would . I guess those are synonyms as well . Just so you ca n't say I took it out of context here is Dr. Olsen 's letter in it 's entirety . National Museum of Natural History Smithsonian Institution Washington , D. C. 20560 1 November 1999 OPEN LETTER TO : Dr. Peter Raven , Secretary PRaven @ nas.org Committee for Research and Exploration National Geographic Society Washington , DC 20036 Dear Peter , I thought that I should address to you the concerns expressed below because your committee is at least partly involved and because you are certainly now the most prominent scientist at the National Geographic Society . With the publication of `` Feathers for T . rex ? '' by Christopher P. Sloan in its November issue , National Geographic has reached an all-time low for engaging in sensationalistic , unsubstantiated , tabloid journalism . But at the same time the magazine may now claim to have taken its place in formal taxonomic literature . Although it is possible that Mr. Czerkas `` will later name '' the specimen identified on page 100 as Archaeoraptor liaoningensis , there is no longer any need for him to do so . Because this Latinized binomial has apparently not been published previously and has now appeared with a full-spread photograph of the specimen `` accompanied by a description or definition that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon , '' the name Archaeoraptor liaoningensis Sloan is now available for purposes of zoological nomenclature as of its appearance in National Geographic ( International Code of Zoological Nomenclature , Article 13a , i ) . This is the worst nightmare of many zoologists -- -that their chance to name a new organism will be inadvertently scooped by some witless journalist . Clearly , National Geographic is not receiving competent consultation in certain scientific matters . Sloan 's article explicitly states that the specimen in question is known to have been illegally exported and that `` the Czerkases now plan to return it to China . '' In Washington , in June of 1996 , more than forty participants at the 4th International Meeting of the Society of Avian Paleontology and Evolution , held at the Smithsonian Institution , were signatories to a letter to the Director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences that deplored the illegal trade in fossils from China and encouraged the Chinese government to take further action to curb this exploitation . There were a few fossil dealers at that meeting and they certainly got the message . Thus , at least since mid-1996 it can hardly have been a secret to anyone in the scientific community or the commercial fossil business that fossils from Liaoning offered for sale outside of China are contraband . Most , if not all , major natural history museums in the United States have policies in effect that prohibit their staff from accepting any specimens that were not legally collected and exported from the country of origin . The National Geographic Society has not only supported research on such material , but has sensationalized , and is now exhibiting , an admittedly illicit specimen that would have been morally , administratively , and perhaps legally , off-limits to researchers in reputable scientific institutions . Prior to the publication of the article `` Dinosaurs Take Wing '' in the July 1998 National Geographic , Lou Mazzatenta , the photographer for Sloan 's article , invited me to the National Geographic Society to review his photographs of Chinese fossils and to comment on the slant being given to the story . At that time , I tried to interject the fact that strongly supported alternative viewpoints existed to what National Geographic intended to present , but it eventually became clear to me that National Geographic was not interested in anything other than the prevailing dogma that birds evolved from dinosaurs . Sloan 's article takes the prejudice to an entirely new level and consists in large part of unverifiable or undocumented information that `` makes '' the news rather than reporting it . His bald statement that `` we can now say that birds are theropods just as confidently as we say that humans are mammals '' is not even suggested as reflecting the views of a particular scientist or group of scientists , so that it figures as little more than editorial propagandizing . This melodramatic assertion had already been disproven by recent studies of embryology and comparative morphology , which , of course , are never mentioned . More importantly , however , none of the structures illustrated in Sloan 's article that are claimed to be feathers have actually been proven to be feathers . Saying that they are is little more than wishful thinking that has been presented as fact . The statement on page 103 that `` hollow , hairlike structures characterize protofeathers '' is nonsense considering that protofeathers exist only as a theoretical construct , so that the internal structure of one is even more hypothetical . The hype about feathered dinosaurs in the exhibit currently on display at the National Geographic Society is even worse , and makes the spurious claim that there is strong evidence that a wide variety of carnivorous dinosaurs had feathers . A model of the undisputed dinosaur Deinonychus and illustrations of baby tyrannosaurs are shown clad in feathers , all of which is simply imaginary and has no place outside of science fiction . The idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at Nature and National Geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith . Truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program , which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age -- -the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion . If Sloan 's article is not the crescendo of this fantasia , it is difficult to imagine to what heights it can next be taken . But it is certain that when the folly has run its course and has been fully exposed , National Geographic will unfortunately play a prominent but unenviable role in the book that summarizes the whole sorry episode .

Olson Curator of Birds National Museum of Natural History Smithsonian Institution Washington , DC 20560 Ph . 202-357-33212 FAX 1-202-633-8084 email : olson.storrs @ nmnh.si.edu Why do n't you write Dr. Olson and ask him if this is true ?	disagree	sarc

If you believe anything that you havent proven to yourself , then you are placing faith in the source that the information came from . Have you personally taken samples from the rings of trees and the corals that the scientists have used to measure the ammount of carbon that was present at these times and personally carbon dated the earth yourself ?	Well , that 's not exactly true . I do n't put absolute faith in the results of science , but I do trust that scientists are not lying . They may be wrong , but I do n't defend what they say to the death . I do n't have an absolute belief in what they have found or the conclusions they 've drawn . I tend to `` believe '' the big bang theory , but I have serious doubts as to its validity . I think the ability to change your mind about things as they come is what makes it not faith . Trusting scientists that they are n't lying does n't mean that I have faith in what they say . Faith is a really strong word . edit - Oh , I also realize what you are saying so I 'll try to explain . Scientists publish their results in journals . Their methods and results are there for everyone to see . All you and I have to do is go to a library that subscribes to the journal , or personally subscribe to it , and look up their work . If you had a problem with what they did , you can do your own experiments to prove them wrong , or at least make your case why you think they are wrong . Now , getting your results published is another can of worms . But , anyway , you or I do n't have to be published to redo the experiments ourselves , but that might take some money . Anyway , all I 'm saying is that once something is published , it 's not written in stone . It does n't become infallible scripture . People who read it , `` believe '' it ( or not ) , based on their own knowledge of the subject . Results and conclusions are challenged all the time . Interpretations are modified all the time . I really do n't see what any of this has to do with Faith .	disagree	notsarc

Because if evolution can not explain all changes it is false , Unless you propose some creatures evolved and some were specially created . Is that what you mean ?	That 's just not true . It is a logical fallacy . Evolutionary theory makes no claims to be able to recount every mutation , recombination , migration , random mating , or chance death of every organsim . But the evidence for evolution is beyond dispute . More than 99 % of degreed biologists accept evolutionary theory as the best explanation for the observed data .	neutral	notsarc
First of all , is evolution defined as the development of new body parts on organisms ? Define evolution before you start arguing about what constitutes as evidence for or against it .	I think his point is paulie , that if evolution is actually as evo defines it , as changes made by way of random mutations , then why does n't life reflect those random mutations ? For example , why have n't a large number of lower animals who live their lives being hunted by carnivores adapted eyes in the back of their heads as a needed early warning system to see their stalkers coming from behind them ? Especially in times of drought and famine when food is scarce ? The environmental pressure exists at those times to justify such a change , yet from fish to birds to reptiles to mammals to even insects , most every creature in creation has 2 eyes , 1 mouth , 2 ears , ( if they even have ears since some animals use vibration sensors to locate the movement of prey and predator . ) It makes sense that Eagles , Hawks and Falcons have only 2 eyes since they are apex predators which rule their skies . But they regularly swoop down on smaller birds and pluck them out of the sky for food for their young . So why have n't smaller birds found the need to evolve eyes in the back of their heads ? One reptile has a type of third eye , but it is n't for sight nor is it permanent . It is used to absorb vitamin D from the Sun for the first 6 months of life in order to help it grow into a healthy adult . Then it is covered by scales . Tuatara Fact Sheet But the question persists as to why it seemingly devolved the need for that third eye if it originally had 3 working eyes ? I mean , it did n't simultaneously evolve a poison gland or some other form of defense to replace the need for it . Now let 's look at some insects which you will invariably mention as flaws in my argument . They too have extra eyes called ocelli , not working eyes mind you ; and neither do they aid in sight but the ocelli are simple structures and are believed they only detect light levels and movement . Now why would evolution not give vulnerable flying insects perfect vision when they have allegedly had literally hundreds of millions of years and many reasons to evolve it ? Are you aware that the visual acuity of insects is approximately 1 % of that of humans ? And we all know that humans do n't have the best eye sight in the animal kingdom . MICROSCOPY-UK / MICSCAPE - Insect insights . Insect eyes . Honeybee legs . What really distinguishes evolutionists from creationists is that creationists will ask the questions fear to ask since this fraudulent gospel has so many inconsistencies which ca n't be reasonably or rationally answered , they refuse to even consider them . Keep in mind that I have pointed out scientifically documented realities about what exists within the animal kingdom , but what I will get back from you are what ifs and maybes regarding these inconsistencies . Why is it that you never look at what is evolutionary dogma and ask why if random mutation happens based on environmental , social and predatory pressures , has n't it made more diverse selections where needed , as in a working third eye in the back of animals heads , rather than in all cases follow a proscribed formula which exists today , just as it existed in the oldest fossils ever collected ?	disagree	notsarc
2 ) The term `` marriage '' is not exclusively reserved for a union between man and woman .

Is it not possible marriage can also be used to describe gay unions ?

Nice job moving the goalpost , and changing the subject also . Show where in BCR 's post which you quoted above , he said even spoke to the issue of genes ?

The bacteria works on a microscopic level and could n't care less what product we have made from those chemicals which it thrives on . So your example is both fallacious and moot .	And the ability to digest nylon is not a new function ? ? You seem to have a different conception of 'new function ' that what matches with reality .	neutral	sarc
I agree ... it 's just too bad sometimes with young adults they do n't think about what might happen , they just respond with natural urges .

If so consider there are lots of children waiting to be taken in and most of them are n't infants .	I do n't think we have any business forcing anyone to do something they do n't want to do . The father is supplying his DNA when he engages in sexual relations . After than point he has in effect signed a blank check . It 's like the old saw , if you do n't want to do the time , do n't do the crime . Fathers to be should n't be engaging in sex unless they intend to pony up with the montly check .

I do n't know if I can accept `` creationist science '' as a true form of science . True science involves developing explanations for phenomena based on ALL available evidence gathered .

Then they will choose a couple lame pieces of evidence for a young earth , such as Robt Gentry 's Polonium halos , rate of decay in the earth 's magnetic field , rates of sediment/salt deposition in the ocean or rate of population growth . This is supposed to outweigh the evidence from thousands of good radiometric dates . Creationists are not very good at doing science but they are good at picking cherries . So if you own an orchard and need a few good field hands , hire a young earth creationist .	agree	sarc

I did n't go into enough detail with respect to unmarried hetero couples . Right now , most states have `` common law '' marriage statutes in which a partner of the opposite sex can lay claim to a portion of their unmarried partner 's property if they 've lived together for a defined period of time . Allowing gay marriage without also rewriting common law statutes discriminates against unmarried heteros living together . Without legal gay marriage , gay partners do n't have to worry about common law statutes being used against them by their partner . Does that explain it better ?	Well , I disagree that it discriminates against unmarried heterosexual couples ; those couples still have the choice to get married to recieve the benefits of marriage or stay unmarried . Same-sex couples do not have that choice currently , and all we are talking about is giving them that choice . Unmarried heterosexual couples are not affected and have the same choice available to them . Though now that I think about it , you may be saying that the common law statutes are applies to unmarried opposite-sex couples but not to unmarried same-sex couples ? Well , in all honesty I think that is very unfair regardless of marriage status . The same common law rules should apply to both heterosexual and homosexual couples . I see no reason why this would n't be updated along with marriage . As for common law statutes being used against same-sex partners , well again , that is an argument against marriage or common law statutes , not against same-sex marriage specifically . It is n't a reason to disallow marriage to same-sex couples but allow it for opposite-sex couples .	disagree	notsarc

I was requested to start a new thread in which pro-gay and anti-gay marriage positions could be debated without posters being called `` homophobes '' , `` gay bashers '' and `` bigots '' simply because they do n't favor gay marriage . While I '' ve already stated why I 'm against gay marriage in previous threads , I 'll reiterate them here for newbies and for simplicity sake . 1 . Gay marriage creates a new dependent class of citizen 2 . It is an unfunded mandate and therefore , illegal 3 . It forces additional costs on an employer via healthcare benefits 4 . It adds costs to the court system via increased litigation over custody , property , inheritance , etc. , 5 . It allows more people to lay claim to finite SS and other entitlement benefits 6 . It establishes a loophole to transfer property without payment of inheritance taxes . 7 . It establishes a mechanism to bypass the payment of taxes on life insurance payouts . These should be enough fodder to get the ball rolling .	You know what I find amusing here ... your entire argument revolves around how it will affect your wallet . Forget about the lives of the people who are denied rights in this country that you take forgranted . That is the true christian-American spirit is n't it ?

The following is summarized mostly from an article by George Cook in the December 1999 issue of the Quarterly Review of Biology . Many of the details of the research that ruled out Lamarckianism are no longer taught to Biology undergrads because the old controversies are no longer in the slightest bit controversial , and the field has moved on to much more interesting debates . The students are simply taught that Lamarckianism is an egregiously failed concept . Back in the 1890 's August Weismann and Herbert Spencer argued at length over the possibility of Lamarckian evolution ( Spencer for , Weismann against ) . Supporters of Herbert Spencer , notably the paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn , realized that this issue could only be settled experimentally , so he and his colleagues called for an institute to be set up to run the appropriate experiments . This ultimately lead to the Station for Experimental Evolution at Cold Spring Harbor in New York , and it also persuaded a lot of biologists of all stripes to research the controversy and run experiments . Ultimately this all came to naught after 15-30 years because even the most ardent supporters of Lamarckian evolution recognized that they had had no successes in demonstrating Lamarckian evolution For example , Bumpus 's four famous studies failed to detect any self-adaptation in transplanted stocks of animals . Specifically , Bumpus ( 1898 ) found increased variation but no beneficial self-adaptation in stocks of birds transplanted to new habitats where they lacked their previous heavy predation . In a subsequent study he transplanted both groups ( the old original and the more diverse offshoot group ) to a third location , and showed that each group continued true to type , notably including the higher variation of the group that had been released from heavy predation loads . This showed that the initial change had been evolutionary in nature , and that the creatures were unable to quickly modify themselves to a new ideal . ... ... ... . Starting around 1909 , Francis Sumner was able to produce different development of traits in originally identical Peromyscus mice that were reared under highly dissimilar conditions . He even thought for a while that he had showed a degree of inheritance of these acquired characteristics . However , he realized after a long while ( 1932 ) that his results were unltimately far more easily explained as a result of mendelian genetics . All this and much more were viewed as absolutely devastating to the Neo-Lamarckian cause , and the whole field was transformed and replaced by the advent of the neo-Darwinian synthesis , as Fisher and Wright and others demonstrated how natural selection was consistent with mendelian genetics , and how the Cold Spring Harbor work was so much more easily understood by reference to Mendelian genetics . However , the effort to demonstrate Lamarckianism by carefully designed and cleanly performed experiments set an extremely important and beneficial standard for experimental biology thereafter .	So , he 's immune to new information that contradicts his beliefs . He does n't care , he has his own predetermined conclusions bolstered by reading whatever creationist rubbish he can find , and he simply refuses to let anything else make an impression on him .	neutral	notsarc
Perhaps it is just semantics here , but a place that tells a mythical tale rather than relating reality does n't have the right to call itself a museum . It is a theme park .

Enjoy . link	Another question might be , have evolutionists figured out the `` mock '' gene yet ? Mockery was a great ingredient in Christian salvation .

How about where ownership and use of weapons does not violate the rights of others . Before you respons think about it . Do anything you want . If I do n't violate anyone then what is the beef ? If I do n't break any laws or endanger anyone what is the beef ? The safe storage and handling of cannon , cannon propellant , and cannon ammo is well known . They can be stored in places typical of homes without violating the rights of others . BTW a cannon is not a weapon . It is considered a 'firework ' by the ATF . Ever see a civil war renactment ?

Vermont legalizes gay marriage -- chicagotribune.com chicagotribune.com Vermont legalizes gay marriage The Associated Press 6:57 PM CDT , April 7 , 2009 MONTPELIER , Vt. -- The marriage proposal came not over a candlelit dinner or on a scenic mountaintop ; instead the couple were surrounded by a throng of gay rights supporters outside the Vermont House chamber . `` We have n't decided who 's going to propose to who yet , '' former lawmaker Robert Dostis said as he stood next to his longtime partner , Chuck Kletecka . `` But we 've been together 25 years in September , and I think September 14th would be a nice wedding day . '' `` Sounds good to me , '' Kletecka replied . `` I accept . '' The exchange came just after the Vermont House narrowly achieved the two-thirds majority necessary to overcome Republican Gov . Jim Douglas ' veto of a gay marriage bill . Vermont was the first state to give gay and lesbian couples legal recognition with its civil unions law in 2000 . It jumped to the lead again Tuesday : After courts in three other states had legalized gay marriage , Vermont became the first to have its Legislature do so on its own . Bills to allow same-sex marriage are currently before lawmakers in New Hampshire , Maine , New York and New Jersey . The three other states that allow same-sex marriage -- Connecticut , Massachusetts and Iowa -- moved to do so first through the courts , not their legislatures . `` For a popularly elected legislature to make this decision is a much more democratic process '' because lawmakers have to answer to the voters every other November , said Eric Davis , a retired Middlebury College political science professor . Courts typically deal with arcane points of constitutional law . While legislatures debate some of the same principles , the process may become much more personal . In Vermont , some of the most gripping debate came when gay lawmakers took to the House floor last Thursday and told their own love stories . Getting gay marriage approved in a political , rather than purely legal , forum is a big step , said Boston University law professor Linda McLain , an expert on family law and policy . `` What may give courage to other legislatures is that this legislature managed to do it , '' she said . She added that using the civil rights language of equality -- the measure in Vermont was dubbed the marriage equality bill -- could help make gay marriage more acceptable elsewhere . Opponents said they , too , believe activists will be emboldened in other states and could attack the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act , which defines marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman and provides that states need not recognize the marriage of a same-sex couple from another state . The Vermont action comes just days after the Iowa Supreme court ruled that not permitting gay marriage there was unconstitutional . `` To the millions of Americans who care about marriage , we say , 'Get ready . President Obama and Democrats will use Vermont as an excuse to overturn the bipartisan federal Defense of Marriage Act , ' '' said Brian Brown , executive director of the National Organization for Marriage , which waged a radio campaign against the measure . `` The next step is to ask the Supreme Court to impose gay marriage on all 50 states . '' To date , the same-sex marriage movement 's main gains have been in New England , which some attribute to Yankee liberalism and the gradual acceptance of gay relationships after Vermont 's groundbreaking civil unions law took effect in 2000 . Douglas had announced his intent to veto the gay marriage bill two weeks ago , saying he believed marriage should be limited to a man and a woman and calling the issue a distraction from more important economic and budgetary issues . In Tuesday 's vote , a yes was needed from two-thirds of those present to override the governor 's veto . The goal was easily achieved in the Senate , which voted 23-5 , but in the House the vote was much closer , 100-49 . The speaker 's announcement of the results to a packed Statehouse chamber set off whistles and cheers among supporters whose hopes had been temporarily dashed when the governor announced he would veto the measure if it passed the Legislature . Among the celebrants were Kletecka and Dostis , who recalled efforts to expand gay rights dating to an anti-discrimination law passed in 1992 . `` It 's been almost 20 years to get to this point , '' Dostis said . `` I think finally , most people in Vermont understand that we 're a couple like any other couple . We 're as good and as bad as any other group of people . '' Craig Bensen , a gay marriage opponent who had lobbied unsuccessfully for a nonbinding referendum on the question , said his side was outspent by supporters by 20-1 . `` The other side had a highly funded , extremely well-oiled machine with all the political leadership except the governor pushing to make this happen , '' he said . `` The fact that it came down to this tight a vote is really astounding . '' The measure had only 95 yes votes when it passed the House on Friday . But some changed their votes Tuesday . Rep. Jeff Young , D- St. Albans , who voted no twice because he 's philosophically opposed to gay marriage , joined most other Democrats in voting to override Douglas ' veto . `` I think if I wanted to continue my career here and have any chance of being effective , I had to vote with my caucus , '' he said . `` You have some pet projects , you think you can help your district back home with things that need to happen . I want to get a railroading bill through . I would n't even have had a chance to testify , let alone get it through . Now , people will listen to me . It 's the way the political game is played .

the very same genetic similarities you will use to claim our familial relationship with chimps also makes absolute claims about how our genetic material defines our intelligence , imagination , creativity , reasoning ability and our hunger to grow intellectually and seek to continually improve our World to suit our personal needs .	No , it does n't . Our genotype ( together with other epigenetic modifiers ) gives us a much bigger brain than chimps , although it is structured very similarly . On top of that , what we accomplish with our bigger brain is , as I 've already demonstrated in other threads with reference to feral children , greatly dependent upon the accumulated wisdom imprinted upon the brain during infancy . We teach our children to problem-solve . We teach them language and abstract thought - we train the various parts of the brain to do their job properly . We are n't born 'complete ' . Even as adults , not everyone is equally quick-witted , not everyone has an equal facility for logical thought - and this has a lot to do with how their brain has been trained during its development . Other apes can also be taught these same concepts - to a more limited degree , sure , but then the related parts of their brain are smaller and less capable .	disagree	notsarc

The Bible only refers to `` high hills '' , and the mountains today wre formed only towards the end of , and after , the Flood by collision of the tectonic plates and the associated upthrusting .	Well , yes , I can assert anything is true if I am allowed to make up new science to explain it . As you may have noticed , rocks do n't bend very easily - a sudden force ( by `` sudden '' I even mean increasing the pressure on a rock over a time that may seem long to people ) will shatter a rock . In the Himalayas , Rockies , Appalachians , we see that the strata are smoothly folded over long distances . This is only possible by applying great pressures over very long periods of time , at pretty high temperatures . A sudden collision of the continents at the end of the flood would produce very different geologic features . That is the difference between accepted geologic theories and creationist theories . Geologic theories rely on known scientific laws and principles , whereas the creationists have to either make up brand new scientific theories and principles ( like the infamous changing speed of light ) and/or ignore evidence that directly contradicts there hypotheses .	neutral	sarc

That 's what bothers me so much about the pro-choice position on personhood regarding a fetus : there is an obvious double-standard .

Ok I 'm put out , I just spent an hour replying to your original post bootfitter and somehow lost it . I 'll sum up . It seems that you would be willing to grant that and unborn baby has the same rights you have , if one could prove that the baby is 'human ' well I could go into the week by week day day thing of how the baby developes . Or I could just ask you . What do you consider to be the reason the baby is NOT human until birth ? or the third trimester or some other point	( Sorry to hear you lost an hour 's worth of work ... I hate it when that happens ! ) I may not have made this clear , but here are the facts : 1 ) A unique human entity comes into existence at the point of conception/fertilization . It is pointless to argue this fact , because the evidence to suggest that this is true is insurmountable . The zygote/blastocyst/embryo/fetus/neonate/baby/child ( whichever label you choose ) is a member of the species homo sapiens sapiens . Period . 2 ) Just because something is human does not necessarily make it a 'human being ' or a 'person . ' These are not scientific terms . It is impossible to 'prove ' that a pre-birth human entity is a 'human being ' under all possible interpretations of a 'human being . ' The argument could be made , for example , that a 'being ' must have some sort of self-awareness . It would be quite difficult to find evidence that suggests that a developing human blastocyst has any self-awareness . So , to answer your question , regardless of what anyone believes , a post-conception entity formed from a human sperm and a human ovum is a unique human entity from that point on . My question to you : What do you consider to be the reason the pre-birth baby is a 'human being ' that deserves 'personhood ' according to the law ?	disagree	notsarc

The government was right to tighten up the law governing the ownership of firearms after the 1996 Dunblane massacre . But Derrick Bird met the new criteria in the 1997 legislation and duly held licensed weapons . Comments by those who knew him centre around a common theme : it was totally unexpected . That nice , agreeable man simply flipped . But if the post-Dunblane legislation failed to prevent someone like Bird from holding firearms legally , then it is equally clear that it has had no effect on the supply and availability of illegal guns , including automatic rifles and other repeat-action weapons that are used routinely in gang activity in urban areas . Even if , as a result of Cumbria , the government were to make it virtually impossible for farmers and other rural folk to own guns , it would have no impact whatsoever on our efforts to tackle gun crime in urban areas . We would succeed in widening the divide between the two societies , but we would fail in keeping more of our young people alive . And we would only lend credence to those who suggest that the gang members who make guns their weapon of choice are simply congenitally prone to commit violent crime . The real killers in our society are those dealers in death who put illegal firearms in the hands of our young people .

would you have a problem calling a guy marrage a `` civil union '' ?	Yes , I would . The term is not simply just words . The definition of Civil Unions do not allow for the over 1,100 rights , liberties and protections granted to otherwise Legally Married couples . Civil Unions are non-transportable , meaning a civil union from one state can not be recognized in other states . Now if you would like to call ALL legally recognized unions as Legal marriage , fine . That goes for heterosexuals as well . I just ca n't see that a heterosexual couple would ever want to enter into a `` civil union '' being as they would be denied spousal recognitions and transportability . I have als been asked before , in another forum , if I would be opposed to leaving the decission up to individual states . My answer is , yes . Due to the fact that legal marriages between heterosexual couples are granted federal recognition , benefits and interstate transportability which would be denied to Civil Unions if left up to individual states . Also we all know what would have happened if individual states were allowed to have determined women 's right to vote , interracial marriage and de-segragation . None of those would have happened . Sometimes the general public just does n't know what 's best for their state 's citizens . Much of the voting public is simply just too under-informed or misinformed . HR3313 ( Protection of Marriage Act ) and DOMA ... MUST be repealed and steps to make all rights equal must be taken . The issue of gay marriage rights is indeed a civil rights issue .

What is the convincing evidence ( that would keep one from taking a leap of faith to believe in the theory ) for macroevolution and secular humanism ?	Well , your question does n't need the macro bit in there as evolution happens or it does n't , the `` macro '' bit is once again an artifact of our view on the world ( ie . our short lives make it rather difficult to see evolution shape anything other than the organisms with the fastest of reproductive cycles . ) Given we have evidence of life ( fossils ) changing over time ( radiometric dating and stratigraphy ) we know it takes many of thousands , if not millions of years for noticable to-the-eye changes in animals to occur . Once again it is important to consider perspective- we only have the equivalent of a few frames ( fossils ) from the movie of life ( geological time ) and there is much that is lost to history forever . Still , enough remains to support evolution , unless you were to purposefully disregard the facts we find . On your final point it is rather out of context , and I suspect not accidentally so .

Any complaints about telescope time echo the complaints of astronomers everwhere that have to clamor and compete for the same telescopes .

There are people into the plasma universe , and the electric universe , or whatever , then there are people like Eugene Savov and his `` fireworks '' universe . These people are generally considered crackpots , but they are n't pushing creationism , they are just pushing theories weaker than the BB theory .

When Chicago passed a ban on handgun ownership in 1982 , it was part of a trend . Washington , D.C. , had done it in 1976 , and a few Chicago suburbs took up the cause in the following years . They all expected to reduce the number of guns and thus curtail bloodshed . District of Columbia Attorney General Linda Singer told The Washington Post in 2007 , `` It 's a pretty common-sense idea that the more guns there are around , the more gun violence you 'll have . '' Nadine Winters , a member of the Washington City Council in 1976 , said she assumed at the time that the policy `` would spread to other places . '' But the fad never really caught fire  even before last summer , when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the D.C. law and cast doubt on the others , including the Chicago ordinance before the court Tuesday . The Second Amendment may kill such restrictions , but in most places , it was n't needed to keep them from hatching in the first place . Maybe that 's because there were so many flaws in the basic idea . Or maybe it was because strict gun control makes even less sense at the municipal level than it does on a broader scale . At any rate , the policy turned out to be a comprehensive dud . In the years following its ban , Washington did not generate a decline in gun murders . In fact , the number of killings rose by 156 percent  at a time when murders nationally increased by just 32 percent . For a while , the city vied regularly for the title of murder capital of America . Chicago followed a similar course . In the decade after it outlawed handguns , murders jumped by 41 percent , compared with an 18 percent rise in the entire United States . One problem is that the bans did n't actually have any discernible effect on the availability of guns to people with felonious intent . As with drugs and hookers , when there is a demand for guns , there will always be a supply . Who places the highest value on owning a firearm ? Criminals . Who is least likely to fear being prosecuted for violating the law ? Criminals . Who is most likely to have access to illicit dealers ? You guessed it . If we were starting out in a country with zero guns , it might be possible to keep such weapons away from bad guys . But that 's not this country , which has more than 200 million firearms in private hands and a large , perpetual supply of legal handguns . Only a tiny percentage of those weapons has to be diverted to the underground trade for crooks to acquire all the firepower they need . While gun bans greatly impede the law-abiding , they pose only a trivial inconvenience to the lawless . This is especially true at the local level . Banning guns from one city makes about as much sense as banning them on one block . It 's hard enough to halt the flow of guns over international borders , where governments police traffic . It 's impossible to stop them from crossing municipal boundaries  which are unmonitored , undefended and practically invisible . Tens of thousands of cars enter Washington and Chicago each day from places where guns are easily and legally obtainable . Any of those vehicles could be transporting a carton of pistols to sell to willing thugs . If you 're on an island , you 're going to get splashed by the waves . The proponents obviously knew all along this city-by-city approach had serious shortcomings . But they figured it was bound to curtail gun availability somewhat . They also hoped that by prohibiting handguns in one place , they were beginning a bigger process . First , they expected that other cities and states would follow suit . Second , they wagered that strict controls at the local level would acclimate Americans to new regulations at the national level . But things did n't work out that way . The persistence of crime in supposedly gun-free zones did n't build support for broader gun control by showing the limits of piecemeal legislation . It weakened the case , by proving that such regulations have little impact on the people who present the biggest danger . Instead of a broad upward avenue , it was a dead end . Gun control supporters fear that if the Supreme Court invalidates local handgun bans , the consequences will be nothing but bad . That would be easier to believe if the laws had ever done any good .	Only a complete XXXXX , devoid of even the slightest measurable amount of critical thinking skills , would support Chicago 's handgun ban .	neutral	sarc

Let me get this straight . We ca n't force a woman to give birth if she does n't want the child , but we can force the father to pay for the child 's care regardless of whether he wanted the child or not ? Interesting .	Yes because it is `` officially '' a life . Whether a person believes in life at conception or not they all agree it is life at birth and half way through life it is still life and right before death it is still life . If she does not want the child she can refrain from sex , use a contraceptive or abortion . If he does not want it he can refrain from sex ( not likely for men ) , use a condom ( not a guarantee to work ) , have surgery ( hard to reverse ) but that is it . So if he was to use a condom and get her pregnant she still has the last option .	neutral	notsarc

Well , it was n't just a footnote that Lott supposedly lost . It was all his raw data to support his claim that 98 % of defensive gun uses do n't involve the firing of the weapon . And Lott did lie because changed his story about who conducted the story . `` When Lott cited the statistic peripherally on page three of his book , he attributed it to 'national surveys . ' In the second edition , he changed the citation to 'a national survey that I conducted . ' He has also incorrectly attributed the figure to newspaper polls and Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck . '' http : //www.townhall.com/columnists/m ... 20030205.shtml So was it a newspaper poll ? Did Kleck conduct it ? Now Lott claims he did it . If true , he must have been lying when he said that others conducted the study . `` He has forgotten the names of the students who allegedly helped with the survey and who supposedly dialed thousands of survey respondents long-distance from their own dorm rooms using survey software Lott ca n't identify or produce . '' Interesting how he ca n't remember anyone who helped him .	Yet , tehre seem to be people who remember taking the poll . Regardless , in his report it was a minor point . From a realistic standpoint , it took nothing away from the report when he removed it . Lott was investigated for this , just like Bellisiles . He was not found guilty of any academic misconduct ( unlike Bellesiles ) . When you consider the thousands fo data sets that he compiled to put that report together , the folks investigating him did n't think it was at all unbelieveable that he scoudn ; t remeber the details of where that number came from . Again , though , he ended up removing that number from his report ( the single place that it appeared ) and apologised for using it since he could not provide the raw data or a good cite for it . Here is how he responded to the article you link to : http : //johnrlott.tripod.com/malkinsoped.html It is rather interesting , and well documented .

Hello all . I am new here . I 've been lurking a bit and wondered why homosexuality is even an issue for heteros ? Is it because it 's been hated or `` taboo '' for so long ( a learned reaction perhaps ) ? As a heterosexual , how has homosexuality hurt or affected your life in any way ? As a heterosexual , what gives you the right to dictate how homosexual people live ? What if you have a non-christian living here in America ( that would be me ) ... do you require them to live their lives the Christian way ? Please explain . Thanks , Ladywolf	Well Ladywolf , that is really more of an argument than it is an honest question . If marriage was truly a private affair that impacted nobody outside the couple themselves , then , yes , that question would be valid . But that is a very shallow understanding and a very uninformed understanding of the nature of marriage , because marriage is just as much  if not more so  about the community as it is about the couple themselves . But it 's not the community that gets married . No , it 's not the community that gets married , but it 's the community that enforces marriage and develops marriage . We need to understand that marriage is just as much a social norm  a social ideal  of the kind of behavior that we expect and need for a healthy vibrant society ; as much as it is about the emotional commitment of two people . One of the biggest issues is the social role of marriage . Marriage domesticates men . Men who are not attached permanently to a woman are men that will practice and engage in socially unhealthy behaviors at a much higher level . How will same-sex marriage effect the concept of `` marriage '' ? Marriage becomes reduced down to nothing , because the moral argument for same-sex marriage is the same moral argument for group marriage , for polygamy , and it is going to be impossible to deny polygamous groups  and group marriage people  who come forth in all sincerity and say , `` If you ca n't restrict marriage to only couples of opposite sex , then you ca n't restrict marriage to only two people . '' They are all very much interwoven . The three things that you lose are : 1 ) the domesticating influence of marriage on men ; 2 ) the protective influence of marriage upon women from being victimized and objectified by men ; and 3 ) it provides mothers and fathers for children . When monogamy is lost as an ideal , the idea that a man should commit himself and forego all other sexual relationships but ( the one with ) his wife , then women become commodities to be used and collected by men . When committing yourself to a woman and subjugating your sexual desires for the sake of that woman  when that becomes just one lifestyle choice among many , it is devastating to a culture . Same-sex `` marriage '' also denies every child it touches access to either a mother or father . It is never compassionate to intentionally deny a child either a mother or father .	disagree	notsarc
The difference , and I think it is a significant difference , is that Omegamon spoke of feeling the threat of potential harm . I believe that understanding the risks that are faced every day does not require being fearful of those risks . Nor does it require being stupidly fearless . We all take reasonable steps to reduce our risk of danger every day . To me , the use of a firearm to reduce risk does not seem all that reasonable . The intent of my opening post was to find out why Omegamon and others feel differently .	Because we have different experiences than you and are more educated on the subject . The only ones who tend to ask `` Why do you feel you need a firearm to protect yourself '' are the ones who 've never faced such a situation and do n't know what it 's like to be in such a position .	neutral	sarc

One idea is that organisms are equipped with the flexibility to change their physical or other features during development to accommodate environmental changes , a phenomenon called phenotypic plasticity . The change typically does n't show up in the genes . For instance , in social bees , both the workers and guards have the same genomes but different genes get activated to give them distinct behaviors and appearances . Environmental factors , such as temperature and embryonic diet , prompt genetic activity that ends up casting one bee a worker and the other a guard . If beneficial , this flexibility could be passed on to offspring and so can lead to the evolution of new features in a species . `` This plasticity is heritable , and natural selection can favor different kinds of plasticity , depending on the range of environmental conditions the organism encounters , '' Pigliucci said .	Bertvan : Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis proposes that living individual organisms , not their genomes , respond to internal and environmental challenges , intelligently and purposefully , that such adaptations are inherited epigenetically , as they develop , and the phenotype only instigates a reorganization of its genome to reflect such adaptations if they persistent over many generations .	neutral	notsarc
Originally posted by Pie Hmm , just found this . Turns out that the theropod theory is n't as solid as it seems . If this is incorrect , and you can prove it ( this pertains primarily to Lurch ) try not to get your panties in a twist , okay ? There are a couple problems here : -There are supposed `` inherited similaritys '' in the forelimbs of birds and theropods . Both have a three-fingered `` hand '' , but embryological studies indicate that the `` hand '' of the bird consist of digits II-III-IV , but theropods have I-II-III . This is very contrary to the view that theropods evolved evolved into birds . ( Burke A.C. and Feduccia A. Developmental patterns and the identification of homologies in the avian hand . Science , 24 October 1997 , Volume 278 , 666-668 ) . -A second problem is the structure of the lungs . When studied , Sinosauropteryx revealed that in theropods , the thoracic cavity is seperate from the abdominal cavity near the diaphram . Birds have no such separation . There is no clear way that this could change without debilitating effects to the bird . ( Ruben J.A. , Jones T.D. , Geist N.R . and Hillenius W.J . Lung structure and ventilation in theropod dinosaurs and early birds . Science , 14 November 1997 , Volume 278 , 1267-1270 ) . -Finally , the hips are a trouble spot . While birds are `` bird hipped '' ( duh ) the theropod dinosaurs were `` lizard hipped '' . If evolution is true , then birds should have evolved from the ornithischian dinosaurs , whom were bird hipped .	Did you get this from a website or did you actually go and browse the journals ? I 'm guessing the former as these objections have been specifically addressed before . Do you really expect to learn anything by copying creationist argument after creationist argument from websites that usually requires an understanding , that has taken biologists years to learn , then simply say `` here , deal with this '' ? Yet when the errors are explained you simply move on to the next subject . I asked myself some time ago , `` What would it take to convince myself that evolution is a good explanation for biodiversity '' , then I set out a series of subjects I did n't understand , read as much creationist material as I could find , then juxtaposing it with as much evolutionary material as I could find and tried to see who was most convincing . Three years and half a biological science degree later I came to several conclusions . 1 ) Creationists have little understanding about the nature of science and evolution for many reasons . 2 ) Evolutionary Biologists have already thought of objections that take creationists years to come up with and debunked them several times over , or made appropriate changes to hypothesis with explanations that are several orders of magnitude more impressive than any creationist material . 3 ) Creationists will obstinately perpetuate falsehoods with inordinate banality , misquote out of context , demonise and vilify beyond logical explanation . 4 ) Evolutionary theory is predictive , falsifiable , consistent , parsimonious and well established amongst the scientific community ; it is the best scientific explanation for biological diversity . As much as I hate saying `` here read this '' , hip morphology is confusing and complicated but is well explained in the journal of dinosaur palaeontology . Follow the link if you want to resolve the confusion with hips . Let 's try and keep it civil people .	neutral	notsarc

I do n't have a large amount of interest in this topic and thus have n't heard alot of argument for or against it . I do n't have an opinion and stand no chance against those who know beyond infinite times more on this topic than I do . But regardless , I still have a question . Maybe I 'm wrong but , is n't lowering shootings a siginificant point in those who want to ban guns ? So they want to make the guns illegal and thus the only place they would be available is in the `` black market '' . Now we all know that guns in cases serve as a form of self protection from other people who would want to commit harm to the indiviusal . It is simply an average law abiding man who wants to have this pistol or handgun to protect him and or his family from those who would want to bring harm upon him family . The illegalization of these handguns would make it virtually impossible for those law abiding to get one of these guns in hopes of protecting his loved ones . I suppose a hope for those for the illegalization is that this would keep guns out of the hands of criminals . But that does n't make much sense . Making it against the law to own a gun is not going to stop the selling , posession and illegal use of them . Instead it only takes protection out of the hands of those who who only want to use it for `` good '' and does not do alot for those who would use it for `` evil '' . Like weed , making guns illegal would not lower the crime rate , but instead may very well increase those innocent dead because they were without protection .	Your argument is akin to saying `` We ca n't stop people over-dosing on heroin , so let 's legalise it '' Why have limitations on hand-grenades or mines ? People use mines all over the world for bad . Obviously laws are n't going to work ... but perhaps the laws are also suggestive of a particular ethos ; a set of standards that the community believe are necessary for a civil society . Thus , a nation such as New Zealand , or Australia , promotes a more 'community-minded ' citizen then an 'individualisticlly-minded ' citizen . This also carries over into general attitudes towards one 's neighbours . In America , you 're in fear that what little you have is going to be plundered by blacks or hispanics , or commies or someone . Even the government 's out to rip away your rights . This 'seige ' mentality permeates American society . For the interest of those who are n't aware , gun ownership for self-protection ( from nasty criminals ) is not protected by the Constitution ... it is written to state that a well-armed militia is necessary for the protection of rights .	disagree	sarc

youre more concerned about those 22 to 30 thousand gun laws but Im more concerned about the 22 to 30 thousand lives taken by gun violence each year and when youre dead guess what ? then BANG ! you dont have anymore rights protected by the bill of rights because youre dead so if youre really pro american and pro bill of rights then you should worry more about getting good gun control laws passed to protect peoples lives so they can enjoy their rights without having to worry about being shot and losing all their rights maybe youve just been decieved and dont understand what youre supporting	Half of all firearms-related deaths are suicides . Out of the remaining 11 to 15 thousand deaths , the vast majority are the results of police shootings or gang wars .

Yes . I believe it 's a matter of personal individual freedom . If purchased legally , and not used to commit a crime , what harm comes from handgun ownership ? I do n't own one , but I own many other guns . If they can ban handguns , what 's to stop them from banning shotguns , or even BB guns ?	Shotguns are used for hunting . BB guns are n't useful when robbing a store as they 're too 'weak ' . I see no legal use handguns can fulfil , although I 'm fairly neutral on banning them , if the country is already saturated with them . I do n't see what it 's going to achieve ; the people who will mis-use the guns already have them . If there were no handguns in Canada I would support the ban , but as presumably there are already lots , I do n't think the ban 's a great idea . -Wez	neutral	sarc

I am more confused how Libertarian ideology can be used against abortion rights . However pro-life laws often lead to tyranny .	I think the main pro-life argument from the libertarian camp is that pro-life laws are a form of `` negative intrusion , '' just like laws against murder , rape or theft . Libertarian ideology centers around a belief in negative government - a government that can effectively protect its citizens from rapists , murderers , thieves , etc . They oppose both positive government ( i.e . totalitarianism ) and anarchy . Granted , I am not certain if anti-abortion laws are truly negative intrusion .

Those who prefer not to shoulder the burden of providing coverage as good as the law requires can decide to enroll their workers in the public plan at a modest cost. # HCFA and Medicare would function as a single nationwide insurance pool covering close to half the population . So basically either the public plan attracts most Americans , and our system gradually evolves into single-payer or because the floor prevents a race to the bottom , the public-private competition raises the bar on care and efficiency , improving quality and cutting costs , even in the private insurance plans. # The standards would be kept by a strong government watchdog. # What do you think ?

He may have been referring to the hundreds of thousands of kids who ca n't get adopted because they 're not healthy , white infants . The kids stuck in the adoption system or in poor foster care .	So we kill the baby instead ? Interesting idea . How about instead we reform the fostor and adoption care system . No , people ar n't looking for healthy , white infants , they are looking for infants . This automatically reduces 90 % of adoption cases .

On this 35th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision , I would like to share my views on the issue of abortion . Life begins at the point of conception . No one can deny that after a human being is conceived it will develop into the very same being as those debating this issue . What astounds me is that those who favor abortion went through an identical development stage as the being they are condemning to death . Would these very same people agree that a similiar choice should have been made about their own existence ? Abortion today is used primarily as a birth control of convenience because people are too self-centered to take precautions . They prefer their own pleasurable self-indulgence over the care and sanctity of the life they created . What ever happened to taking responsibility for one 's actions in this country ? Is it too much to ask a woman who has conceived to place the child into adoption ? Nine months of discomfort is nothing compared to life in prison for voluntary manslaughter ! Does the father of the child have a say in this ? And what about the constitution of the United States ? Are not all people conceived in this country deserving of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness ? I believe abortion is a crime against humanity and should be outlawed . We need to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision and get back to cherishing life in this country . For a country that murders it 's children can not be far from self destruction .	Hi Joe , welcome to the forum . I must warn you though that you have argued so perfectly and similarly all of the points I just argued on another thread about abortion , that some people around here might just accuse you of being me with a new handle .

Otherwise you would not so vehemently and tenaciously defend that metaphysic against any suggerstionthatits take on reality , its ontology/cosmoly , is incorrect -- even when , as in the case of EAM , that suggestion comes from a metaphysical quarter that has no ideological connection to any religious mythology , and in fact is also antithetical to those myths .	That is merely your interpretation of my actions here , and does not reflect my personal motivations .

I disagree with you because the logic you have used to prop up your assertion that your philosophy mirrors reality is clearly faulty .

Studies of the origin of the first life form , of the origin of the earth , and the origin of the universe itself do not form part of the theory of evolution .

Of the several `` different scientific diciplines '' refered to above , they all have one thing in common since there is only one basic alternative to intelligent design , and that 's undirected , random , happenstance processes . For purposes of this debate , can we come up with one general two word phrase for the `` different scientific diciplines '' - a phrase perfectly comparable to intelligent design , which `` theory of evolution '' is clearly not ? How about `` happenstance origins '' ? Since you declare that intelligent design is not science , you have to have a criteria for science that intelligent design does n't fit . Does `` happenstance origins '' fit the same criteria ? If there is no way to test or falsify intelligent design , there is no way to test or falsify happenstance origins . If intelligent design is n't repeatable , happenstance origins are n't repeatable . Other scientists ca n't apply a scientific method to happenstance origins to get the same kind of results as the original scientist , and on and on . Evolutionists imply that with time , they may be able to scientifically get to the bottom of happenstance origins . That 's no more ( or less ) plausible than intelligent design advocates claim to be able to scientifically get to the bottom of intelligent design . If you demand to know how we can prove intelligent design is false or true before we consider it as science , why ca n't the same be asked of you before you consider the progressive steps of happenstance origins to be science ?

Why does the women get to choose who can come into the world ? They are going to kill it and they do n't care . You never knew what the baby could have been .

I saw Bowling for Columbine . It was excellent . It showed how many Americans have this idea that problems are solved with violence . That 's the way that problems are often dealt with domestically and overseas . That 's why America drops so many bombs on people in foreign nations and kills them . They interviewed some Canadians in the film and the Canadians says that they like to negotiate and work things out . That 's the way they solve problems- not through violence and killing people . I think this is very relevant to the gun culture in America . Those in the gun culture tend to have the attitude that problems can be solved with violence- thus the necessity of owning an instrument of death and destruction . I remember that Michael Moore went into the house of one gun owner and the gun owner showed him the loaded gun that he slept with under his pillow . I think that 's dangerous and totally stupid to sleep with a gun under your pillow . The film also examined famous people from the gun culture like Terry Nichols and Timothy McVeigh . Moore also accomplished some good things . He went to K-mart with some victims of Columbine and convinced K-mart to stop selling handgun ammunition .

..a piece of genetic material taken from your own body and inserted into a sterile egg to create a batch of undifferentiated cells to reinsert into your body to save your life ?	The stem cells that are used for such potentially life-saving procedures are at such an extremely early stage of development that there is no biological possibility that the beginnings of a mind exist . There is absolutely no feeling , no emotion , no thought , no sense of pain . The batch of cells is still an object . They are the very beginnings of the body where the beginnings of the mind ( or , for that matter , a soul , if one is of the opinion that a soul must include some sense of mind ) are very far off . However , unless I am mistaken in the biology of this particular batch of cells , they could potentially develop into an actual person ( where , for me , person means not only body but some sense of mind or soul as well ) . This sense of potential personhood should not be taken lightly . This would not be a case of a woman 's right over her own body . This would be the case of deliberately generating living human cells ( note : this is not equal to a living person ) for medical reasons benefiting a living person . In the balance of having some respect for the idea that these cells could potentially become a person ( again , still far off from being actual people - i.e . starting to have a mind ) , I would only condone using such stem cells if it is a case of saving the life of an existing person - be it myself or anyone else . I would not , for example , condone use of stem cells to help alleviate a medical condition which is not life threatening .	neutral	sarc

A women by the name of Mary Anne Warren said this The fact that restricting access to abortion has tragic side effects does not , in itself , show that the restrictions are unjustified , since murder is wrong regardless of the consequences of prohibiting it ; and the appeal to the right to control one 's body , which is generally construed as a property right , is at best a rather feeble arguement for the permissibility of abortion . Mere ownership does not give me the right to kill innocent people whom I find on my property , and indeed I am apt to be held responsible if such people injure themselves while on my property . It is equally unclear that I have any moral right to expel an innocent person from my property when I know that doing so will result in his death . What are you thoughts ? Is this just some pro-life nut that does n't know what she is talking about ?	The sentence that I have underlined above is a falsity in Warren 's argument . There is a distinction between using property to kill someone , and failing to use property to sustain someone . For example : 1 ) Joe shoots Bob with a shotgun . That is murder . 2 ) Bob is hungry , and Joe does n't give him any food , so Bob starves to death . That is not murder - it is death by natural causes . Why is 2 ) not murder ? Because hunger killed Bob , and nobody owns hunger . I think we can apply the same standards to abortions .	neutral	sarc

As I understand , the Second Amendment was written as a protection against political tyranny . The Founding Fathers knew that the King of England had used a standing army to oppress the people in the past . The solution was a well regulated militia and to not limit arms ownership to those in the military . However , because of big advances in military technology it 's difficult to see how the kinds of arms typically owned by modern American gun owners would be very effective against the type of arms used by those in the armed forces . What use would a handgun be against a tank or F-16 Fighter plane ? I think a lot of people are uncomfortable dealing with this issue so they choose to focus a lot on personal self defense against criminals instead of what the Second Amendment is mainly or solely about . We saw this in the recent Supreme Court decision . They chose to focus a lot on the role handguns could play in defending house and home against criminals , but seemed to have no problem with a ban on machine guns- the kind of guns that would logically seem to be most protected by the Second Amendment because of their usefulness in military conflicts which would make them a better deterrent against tyranny than other types of firearms . Thus , the Supreme Court chose to `` strain at a gnat and swallow a camel '' to use a Biblical idiom in their treatment of the Second Amendment .	First , you would n't use a handgun against an F-16 fighter plane . It 's stupid and useless , but there are a lot of ingenious people out there that can probably prop up something to shoot one down , that 's for sure . The second amendment is about self defense regardless of how big or small the threat is . I would think you would appreciate the ban on machine guns , since they are acknowledging that there is line to draw when it comes to it ( like you ca n't own a fighter jet with military armament and just like the 1st Amendment you ca n't yell fire in a crowd . ) Is n't this what most `` living document '' people say ? Oh , I get it now ? It 's not about that is it ? The fact of the matter is , you are dissatisfied that the line was n't drawn to limit even more of it , i.e . a complete ban on firearms , only the national guard or armed forces should have them . Sorry , but if you were to do that , it would open up another can of worms in which would mean that all other confirmed rights could be limited even more . The SCOTUS did the right thing in this instance because they acknowledged there is a line to be drawn , but not the one that prohibits all law abiding citizens from owning firearm .	neutral	notsarc

Its the allegations of babies being killed to fund this I doubt , seems to be an attempt to sensationalise a piece of news . I stand by the original point that there is n't really a medical use for fetus skin as was claimed , some of the organs might be of more use but thats about it .	It may only be salvaging to you but to the parents involved it is body theft .

The zygote is the cell formed when the sperm fertilises the egg . The zygote has no brain , it has no conciousness . You have two tables , one with a small test tube which you know holds a microscopically small living zygote , and another table with a live baby . You are told that one of them will be destroyed and you have just two seconds to decide which , or both will be destroyed . Without a seconds thought I would immediately point in the direction of the zygote , and save the life of the baby . Extreme pro-lifers on the otherhand would probably end up killing the baby or both via indecision and inability to make a choice in just 2 seconds . That 's the morality of pro-life for you : the inability to realise that the chemical reactions that happen when a sperm meets an egg do not define a human person . Am I wrong ? I do n't believe so . The sperm meeting the egg is a really random point to decide the emergance of a human person . Why pick that point specifically ?	Obviously the correct thing to do is kill the zygote . The thing that bothers me about this whole thing is some of the people that said they would refuse to choose . This is characteristic of your typical wimpy religious copout and is nothing but a cheep avoidance tactic . These people are not the kind of people that should be making any important decisions that concern other people so I guess its just as well . A zygote is no more viable then a sperm . The attempt to call a zygote a living being is simply more evidence that the religious have no common sense .	agree	notsarc

A very small fraction of our genetic material -- about 2 % -- performs the crucial task scientists once thought was the sole purpose of the genome : to serve as a blueprint for the production of proteins , the molecules that make cells work and sustain life . This 2 % of human DNA is converted into intermediary molecules called RNAs , which in turn carry instructions within cells for protein manufacture . `` And what of the other 98 % of the genome ? It has been assumed by many to be genetic junk , a massive accumulation of code that evolution has rendered superfluous . Now , however , scientists are discovering that the vast bulk of the DNA in our genomes , while it does not code for the specific RNA molecules that serve as templates for protein synthesis , do nevertheless perform various kinds of work . ''	It is not only supposedly `` junk DNA '' that was used for these kind of arguments . The vertebrate eye has been preached to be a bad design . Why ? Why is it a bad design ? The human eye contain bona fide optical fibers to conduct light ( nice illustration ) . Besides the design arose 40-60 times during evolution , like evolution was biased ( converged on an optimal design ) towards such a structure . So why is it sub optimal ? Are proponents of these arguments going to suggest a better design with all the blueprints ? Thought not , arguments from ignorance are short on design .

Glover , The Human Vermiform Appendixa General Surgeons Reflections , CEN Technical Journal , 3:3138 , 1988 . In short : The appendix contains a high concentration of very specialized structures called lymphoid follicles ( also found throughout the GIT ) . Lymphoid follicles in the appendix produce cells that produce antibodies that control which essential bacteria come to reside in the caecum and colon in neonatal life . The `` strategic '' placement of the appendix is important during the development of neonatal life in the setup of healthy intestinal flora therefore neonatal appendectomy will impair mucosal immunity . `` The appendix 's job is to reboot the digestive system ... '' and `` acts as a good safe house for bacteria , '' . It might not be that important in later life and it can be removed , but so can your one kidney , your stomach , an eye , small intestines , reproductive organs etc .

Again , this is evidence only to suggest not prove . I can not prove nor can anyone else . However , to say that there is no evidence even to suggest it is way beyond the realm of logic .	If you wrote this in response to my post , please note that I said that there is no PHYSICAL evidence that suggests that God exists without the mindset that God exists . Individuals who believe that God exists do not constitute physical evidence of God 's existence . Their belief in God is the reason for their seemingly amazing actions . Their belief is in their mind ( and/or their 'spirit ' ) . It is based on faith . It is not based on physical evidence in reality . The Bible is a book . It was written by human beings ( allegedly inspired by God ) . What is written in the Bible are ideas that were in existence prior to being written down , or they could not have been written down . If there is a central theme of ideas for a segment of the population over a long period of time , the population will be able to continue to write of those similar ideas with great consistency . That still does not constitute physical evidence in reality that God exists . That is just evidence that a similar belief in God has existed over a 'long ' period of time by a segment of the population .	disagree	notsarc

Hi SS . Causing trouble again ? The cat experiment you describe can not , unfortunately , be used to support Lamarckian inheritance , because all the animals were denied the same essential nutrients , both the parents and the developing cats in the womb . Logically , if lack of nourishment causes health problems in one generation it 's inevitably going to cause the same problems in the next even without any evolution taking place . As others have pointed out , this experiment is evidence that adaptation to that restricted diet was not happening . Had the cats initially suffered and then begun to get better , this would be strong evidence that adaptation was occurring . Similarly , if you were denied Vitamin C you would develop scurvy . If a pregnant woman was denied Vitamin C - well , it hardly bears thinking about , but the fact the baby - were it to survive at all - would undoubtedly also suffer from scurvy is readily explicable by the observation that it , too , was denied Vitamin C. Now , if the baby was born with a functional Vitamin C synthesising gene , that would be compelling evidence that organisms could intelligently respond to environmental changes .	Well I 'm not arguing that this is adaptation ... I have never said that.. What I am saying is the environment -- in this case diet is the cause for these traits to emerge in offspring ... ..but like I said earlier ToE does not admit that the diet or any enviornmental variable can influence traits in offspring . Traits are dictated by genes and genes are closed off from the enviornment . This is the basic dogma of Weismann 's barrier . I 'm not necessarily calling this evolution ... .I 'm just simply pointing out that acquired traits can be inherited . There is no other way to describe this other than Lamarckism . Do you disagree that The inheritance of acquired characteristics is simply changes in physiology acquired over the life of an organism that are transmitted to offspring ?	neutral	notsarc

Anti-abortion . Here 's why . Nobody can tell us with any certainty when a person becomes a person . Science ca n't , religion ca n't , and politicians certainly ca n't . Since an abortion has real potential to kill a person it should be illegal for the same reason dropping a brick from the roof of a building is illegal or speeding is illegal or firing a gun randomly in your house is illegal . Many of the laws in this country were formed to make it illegal to do things that might harm/ kill another person . When a inteligent person fires a gun for instance : he makes sure of his target , makes sure there is nobody in front of or behind his target , checks his backstop , etc . In other words the shooter takes precautions to insure that nobody will be harmed . Those types of precautions can not be taken in the case of abortion .

First of all , I am against abortion in nearly every circumstance , to save the mother 's life and rape or incest being the situations I deem it allowable . That said , the anti-abortion people where I live are beginning to get on my last nerve . Every week , they pick out an intersection and hold up gigantic graphic posters , close up bloody pics of aborted babies converted into 6 ft. X 3 ft. posters . Everyone who drives down the street gets these images forced upon them , adults and children , and I just ca n't agree with this tactic . Often when I am stuck at a red light one of the whackos will yell something my way ( little does he or she know my stance on the issue ) and I will generally yell something back like `` Get a f-kin job ya freek ! '' Stuff like that . They have now taken to knocking on vehicle windows at stop lights , attempting to pass out pamphlets - even though that is illegal by city ordinance . Standing on the roadside holding signs and distracting drivers apparently is not . Two days ago I saw the largest intersection protest I have witnessed . There must have been fifty to one hundred protesters holding the giant posters . Part of the reason it happens so often where I live is because we have an abortion clinic that serves most of northern Illinois outside of the Chicago area . The mis-named Northern Illinois Women 's Center is in fact an abortion mill located in a former school ( of all things ) . So that tends to rile folks up . That the owner of the building decided to name the building `` Fort Turner '' and put a large sign out in front ( Turner being the former name of the school ) did n't help matters . Bringing in a tanker truck with manure and threatening to hose down the protestors - now that was funny . Once , a Catholic priest rammed his car into the building to gain access then got out of the vehicle and started chopping the place up with an axe , until he was arrested . Needless to say , the abortion `` clinic '' has been a flashpoint in the community since it was opened at least 20 years ago . Now there are always protestor 's walking with signs in front of the abortion mill , and I can certainly understand that . IMHO that is where they SHOULD be protesting . But , I am becoming more and more perturbed with the people forcing these disgusting giant photo 's on the public in general at public street intersections . Does this sort of random street protest happen elsewhere ? ? ?	They were at the recent inauguration of our new mayor . What troubles me is the fact that they enlist their kids in the protests . Funny you can hold up those pictures but would be arrested if they were of naked women .	agree	sarc
like i said , i am not exactly a scientist so i just wanted to clear something up that confuses me . it is a scientific law that `` matter can neither be created nor destroyed '' correct ? but doesnt this contradict what you said about particles appearing and disappearing ?	Actually , matter can be created and destroyed . It is total energy that is conserved . One example is in a nuclear reactor . The mass of the fission products is less than that of the original fuel . Matter has been `` destroyed . '' But ov course , it became a form of energy - eventually electricity . On the other side , virtual particles spring into existance all the time in a vacuum . But the are a particle and an anti-particle and the net energy is zero so energy is conserved . These ideas come from quantum mechanics . A virtual particle is a particle that can never be directly detected , but whose existence does have measurable effects . One of those effects is the Casimir effect . It is an attractive pressure between two flat , parallel metal plates placed very near to each other in a vacuum . The pressure is due to the reduced number of virtual particles between the plates . When the plates are very close , only particles of certain resonant wavelengths can exist between them . Thus , more particles on the outside push the plates together . Stephen Hawking talks a lot about virtual particle pairs in both A Brief History of Time and The Universe in a Nutshell .	disagree	notsarc

As I see it the problem in this country is not guns . The problem is that our society has gotten soft on crime and pretty much gotten to the point of `` no one is responsible for their own behavior '' . Take the law suits against the gun manufacturer 's . Colt comes to mind . Someone used a Colt firearm in a murder and the victim 's family sued Colt for the wrongful death of a family member . The court 's basically said that colt should have known that their products may have been used in a crime and not sold them to someone who could have used it in the commision of a crime . That being the case , why ca n't the auto manufacturer 's be sued when one of their vehicles is used in the commision of a crime ? Why ca n't Ford or Chevy be sued when one of their vehicles is used in a DUI vehicular homicide ? The reasoning I have read is that the auto maker 's are unable to control the end use of their products . So how can one manufacturer be held responsible for the end use of their product and not another ? Another case in point . Less than a hundred years ago , if you were convicted of a murder you were sentenced to death and the sentence was carried out . Now if you murder somebody , you can plea bargain it down to involuntary manslaughter , get sentenced to 18 to 23 months , and be paroled in 9 to 12 month 's on good behavior . Now some would say the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment . To them I put this question . What do you call kidnapping a child from her bedroom , raping and sodomizing her , putting her on a hot engine block , then strangling her . Do n't know about the rest of society , but that qualifies as cruel and unusual punishment in my book . By the way , the guy that did this was sentenced to life in prison on the taxpayer 's dime . No longer does the punishment fit the crime in this country . We have put a price tag on human life and I must say it is a damn cheap one . Guns are not the problem in this country . The problem is a government who trying to erode our rights to further their own agenda . Now for those who say we have a police force to protect us , if you would actually read their purpose , you would see that the police force has no duty to protect the individual , only the public in general . I have quite a few friends at the local state police barracks and in general they are opposed to gun control . Most police organization who are for gun control who are for gun control are politically motivated . For those who are going to say I 'm a right wing nut job , I 'll give you this . I served my country in various special operations forces . I can not go into anymore more detail than i 'll give you here , so please do n't ask . Automatic weapons were designed for assualt purposes so I will give you that one . However , as a highly decorated combat veteran I will say this . The most dangerous and demoralizing weapon ever made was a sniper rifle . Death can come from anywhere at anytime . Most have an effective range well over any automatic weapon . Sniper rifles are basically modified hunting rifles that can be duplicated by any gunsmith worth his salt . The effective range on a 5.56mm round ( basically a .223 remington ) fired from an M-16 ( or An AR-15 ) is just over 450 meters . A 7.62 x 54 mm round ( a .308 , a very popular hunting round ) is about 1200 meters . To put this in perspective there is just over 1700 meters in a mile . I do carry a M1911 Colt .45 as a concealed carry weapon . After reading some of the other posts here , I must say I am deeply offended by someone saying that because I carry a CCW I 'm going to shoot someone over a fender bender . I will say that their are some who should n't be carrying a CCW . And I do take responsibilty for my weapons . Unfortunately . I have had to use my weapon on a couple of occasions . Most of the time simply brandishing the weapon and taking control of the situation is enough to end it in a positive way . Only once have I had to discharge my weapon in self defense . By the way , the criminal in on the receiving end of that one had a very long and violent criminal history . I have shed the same blood in the same mud as alot of others to insure that EVERYONE in this country has the freedom to have their own opinions about things . That is a right guarenteed in The Constitution of the United States . Just as it is a right for me to own arms of my choice . Some would say that my RKBA is outdated . To them I ask , what if I think your right to free speech or freedom to religion is outdated ? Should it be changed too ? There are no easy solutions to the problem we as a society are facing . But blaming guns or free speech for our problems is like saying flies cause garbage . It is easy to blame guns for our problems . But they are merely a tool , like a shovel , that unless put into use by a person or persons . it merely just sits there and does nothing . Our society has pushed the issue of not being responsible or held accoutable for your actions way to far . I do have a solution to these problems , but most would find it offensive . What the hell , I 've probably offended alot already , so here goes . We have a three time loser law , that if you have three felony convictions you are considered a career criminal . Now alot of those crimes involve firearms . So if you are convicted of three felony firearms crimes , you should get the death penalty to be carried out immediately . It will take some time to get the message across but iI do believe when the message gets out , firearms crimes will be reduced drastically . Well , I need to get some things done so I 'll write more later . Later all ... ...	I think you hit it pretty much on the money . Gun control does not cure anger , hate , and violence . Talk about responsibility . Gun grabbers blame you and me and our behavior for the violence in this country . They blame everyone except the one who pulls the trigger and takes human life .	neutral	notsarc

Making abortion illegal goes against common sense ? I would say that making abortion legal in call cases makes no sense ... but ok. You also maintain that only religious people are against abortion ... I know this is n't true because many of my friends or family are not religious and are against abortion . Not only that , there is an organiztion called lp4life ( libertarians ) and many of them are not religious and they argue against abortion on non-religious grounds which is what many of us do here on the forum . Stop making baseless claims because you have a quarrel with religion . Your unwanted children claim is also baseless . There has already been a debate on this and it is very clear ( as he does n't respond anymore ) that abandoned babies will not increase due to abortion being illegal . Another baseless claim . I do n't understand why you just make claims and then never back them up eventhough you say you use logic and common sense . Is it logical to oppose abortion only because you are mad at a religion ?

Lack of a Natural Mechanism . Charles Darwin , in his Origin of Species , proposed Natural Selection to be the mechanism by which an original simple-celled organism could have evolved gradually into all species observed today , both plant and animal . Darwin defines evolution as `` descent with modification . '' However , Natural Selection is known to be a conservative process , not a means of developing complexity from simplicity . Later , with our increased understanding of genetics , it was thought perhaps Natural Selection in conjunction with genetic mutation allowed for the development of all species from a common ancestor . However , this is theoretical and controversial , since `` beneficial '' mutations have yet to be observed . In fact , scientists have only observed harmful , `` downward '' mutations thus far . Time Constraints . Both Creationists and Evolutionists agree that if evolution is at all possible , there needs to be an excessive ( if not infinite ) amount of time . For much of the 20th century , it was thought evolutionists had all the time they needed . If the earth ever looked too young for certain evolutionary developments to have occurred , the age was pushed back in the textbooks . In 1905 , the earth was declared to be two billion years old . By 1970 , the earth was determined to be 3.5 billion years old , and by the 1990 's , the earth had become 4.6 billion years old . However , Young Earth advocates have identified quite a few Young Earth chronometers in recent years . Currently , there are approximately five times more natural chronometers indicating a `` Young Earth '' than an `` Old Earth . '' Each discovery is a separate `` Limiting Factor '' that places a constraint on the possible age of the earth . For example , moon drift , earth rotation speed , magnetic field decay , erosion rates , chemical influx into the oceans , ocean salinity , etc , all constrain the possible age of the earth . Each Limiting Factor is distinct . If one were successfully challenged , there is still the problem of all the rest . Furthermore , there are Limiting Factors constraining the possible age of the universe , such as spiral galaxies where they 're maintaining their spiral shapes despite their centers spinning faster than their extremities .	You are incorrect when it comes to the age of the earth . All inidciation by all branches of science indicate an earth that is over 3 billion years old . ( aside from the lies of the Young earth creationism . Each and every one of those 'indications ' are based on misunderstandings and out right lies about science .

Reading the opinions in McDonald v. Chicago , you might think it was as much a civil-rights case as a gun case . In the ruling , the Supreme Court decided 54 that the Second Amendment applies to states and localities , not just the federal government , and struck down Chicagos handgun ban . The four conservative justices , along with Justice Anthony Kennedy , formed the majority . One of the conservatives , Clarence Thomas , also filed a concurring opinion . The main disagreement betwee the two opinions concerned whether the Fourteenth Amendments privileges or immunities clause or its due process clause is the best way for the Court to apply constitutional protections to state and local governments . But in the process of making their arguments , both opinions emphasize the racial history of the Fourteenth Amendment  the story of the postCivil War South and the federal governments crusade to ensure fair treatment for blacks therein . The heart of the problem was that , in an effort to stave off rebellion and maintain the racial caste structure that had developed under slavery , state and local governments refused to respect freedmens constitutional rights . Crucial to the Souths efforts were gun-control laws that applied to blacks and blacks alone . This does not show that modern gun controllers are racist , or even that the modern gun-control movement has racist roots ,  as some have suggested  the concerns that motivate Sarah Brady are neither the same as nor descended from the concerns that motivated racist southern governments . But this does show that when a government has the ability to forbid gun ownership , it has the ability to render groups it dislikes helpless to defend themselves . Regardless of whether modern gun control accomplishes its purpose of reducing crime  and for the record , there is no evidence it does  a free society should fear a government with such power . The Souths campaign against black gun ownership , not surprisingly , began long before the Civil War . Two slave rebellions in the 1820s stoked whites fears , and in response , many legislatures amended their laws prohibiting slaves from carrying firearms to apply the prohibition to free blacks as well ,  Thomas notes . Georgia forbade blacks to own , use , or carry fire arms of any description whatever. Florida empowered patrol [ s ]  of white citizens to search negro houses or other suspected places , for fire arms ; blacks caught with guns  whether slave or free  were brought to the nearest justice of the peace for whipping on the bare back , not exceeding thirty-nine lashes. ( They could escape punishment by providing a plain and satisfactory explanation . ) It wasnt just blacks , but also anti-slavery whites , whom governments tried to disarm . For example , during the Bleeding Kansas period  a series of violent skirmishes in the 1850s between pro- and anti-slavery elements in that future border state  there were attempts to take guns from the free-soilers. As the majority opinion in McDonald notes , the 1856 Republican-party platform described this as a violation of the right to keep and bear arms . When the war ended , fear of rebellion peaked , and southern governments ramped up their efforts . Some states passed laws banning black gun ownership or gun carrying , and there was a systematic effort to disarm the freedmen who had served in the Union army and then returned to their homes in the South . Roving bands of exConfederate soldiers , many affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan , took arms from blacks by force while official law enforcement looked the other way . In South Carolina , a group of black citizens wrote the following to Congress : We ask that , inasmuch as the Constitution of the United States explicitly declares that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed . . . that the late efforts of the Legislature of this State to pass an act to deprive us [ of ] arms be forbidden , as a plain violation of the Constitution. The problem wasnt just that the laws were discriminatory , forbidding blacks but not whites to own guns  it was that the government had the right to ban gun ownership by the law-abiding at all . Even if the South had banned all gun ownership , disarmed blacks would have had to deal with the armed and racist state militia and state peace officers ,  the justices note . They might have added that , without technically discriminating by race , the South could have used the techniques it later employed to keep blacks from voting  grandfather clauses , literacy tests , etc .  to exempt whites from facially non-discriminatory gun bans . ( We see a modern analogue to these policies in laws that prevent the poor from owning guns . It costs $ 340 , nonrefundable , just to apply for a gun permit in New York City , and the rich and famous seem to have a lower likelihood of being rejected . Also , the gun-control movement periodically goes after Saturday-night specials  that is , handguns cheap enough that the poor can afford them . ) It was gun-control laws  along with other laws that violated virtually every right blacks had  that led to the Fourteenth Amendment , which authorized the federal government to ensure that state and local governments respected citizens rights . The Freedmens Bureau Act of 1866 , passed just two years before the amendment was approved , made it clear that the right to keep and bear arms was an important right for freed blacks to have : The right . . . to have full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings concerning personal liberty , personal security , and the acquisition , enjoyment , and disposition of estate , real and personal , including the constitutional right to bear arms , shall be secured to and enjoyed by all the citizens . . . without respect to race or color , or previous condition of slavery. Advocates of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 cited the disarmament of freed blacks as a reason the law was necessary . These laws , however , didnt work . Southern governments refused to enforce them , and the Supreme Court  which was far less powerful then than it is today , anyhow  did not intervene . To drive the point home that the South had to respect blacks rights , including the right to bear arms , Republicans in Congress passed the Fourteenth Amendment ( they had the numbers to do this because they had refused to seat the Democrats the South had elected , many of whom were former Confederate soldiers ) , sent it to the states for ratification , put the former Confederate states under martial law via the Reconstruction Acts , and made their ratifying the amendment a condition of ending military rule . The Supreme Courts decision gives Americans a lot to think about  from the privileges or immunities clause to the Courts proper role in enforcing the Constitution . But whenever we discuss gun control , we need to remember that a government capable of gun control is capable of tyranny . Both the majority opinion and Thomass concurrence in McDonald  following in the steps of works such as Stephen P. Halbrooks Securing Civil Rights  perform the crucial service of explaining how important that fact was in the wake of the Civil War .	So you see , Brady , you 're wrong again . The McDonald ruling was n't an issue of guaranteeing white men their ability to feel safe in the face of growing minority groups . Quite the opposite . The McDonald ruling was about striking against those with racist and evil intentions who would use the law to render innocent people helpless for no good reason . It was as much about protecting minorities from harm as anything .	neutral	notsarc

Just for you , I 'll find them again . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . Various quotes - Guns are used to threaten and intimidate far more often than they are used in self defense . Most self reported self defense gun uses may well be illegal and against the interests of society . we find that criminal gun use is far more common than self-defense gun use . This result is consistent with findings from other private surveys and the National Crime Victimization Surveys Firearm self-defense is rare compared with gun crimes . A minority of home invasion crimes result in injury . Measures that increase the difficulty of forced entry or enhance the likelihood of detection could be useful to prevent these crimes . Although firearms are often kept in the home for protection , they are rarely used for this purpose .

'' And I would appreciate it if you would try to understand the differences between the two . `` Pro-lifers '' approach the abortion debate from an `` all life is sacred '' generally religious based point of view . I do not . I neither believe that `` all life is sacred '' nor that `` god '' or religion should be used in the debate at all . 2 .

How about the actual scientists who reject the media promotion of this issue ? Here 's an excerpt : Climatologists Reject Media Claims of Global Warming Consensus `` [ i ] n November 2004 , German climatologist Hans von Storch , director of the GKSS Institute for Coastal Research ( IfK ) in Geesthacht , Germany , foresaw that claims of alarmist consensus would be made by nonscientists ... '' Environment & amp ; Climate News > August 2005 Environment Environment > Climate : Consensus Email a Friend Written By : Alan Caruba Published In : Environment & amp ; Climate News > August 2005 Publication date : 08/01/2005 Publisher : The Heartland Institute Leading climatologists spent the month of June fighting false proclamations from non-scientists claiming scientists have reached agreement that catastrophic global warming is occurring . Alarmists Claim Debate Over On June 1 , California Gov . Arnold Schwarzenegger ( R ) claimed `` the debate is over '' and global warming alarmists ' predictions had carried the day . The Natural Resources Defense Council on June 9 declared , `` The world 's leading scientists now agree that global warming is real and is happening right now . According to their forecasts , extreme changes in climate could produce a future in which erratic and chaotic weather , melting ice caps and rising sea levels usher in an era of drought , crop failure , famine , flood and mass extinctions . '' On June 13 , USA Today declared , `` The debate 's over : Globe is Warming . '' In support of its claim , the newspaper cited the positions of some left-leaning religious groups , some corporations who will reap a financial windfall from a switch to alternative fuel sources , and some politicians . Scientists Disagree While each of the above claims from non-scientists received significant media coverage , leading climatologists spent the month of June rebutting such proclamations . Atmospheric physicist S. Fred Singer , professor emeritus of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and former director of the U.S . Weather Satellite Service , sent a letter to the editor of USA Today directly refuting its claim . `` Your editorial ... claim [ s ] the global warming debate is over . Not so , '' wrote Singer . Singer wrote , `` Sea level will continue to rise by only seven inches per century as it has for thousands of years no matter what we do or what the EPA [ U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ] says . And temperatures in the next 100 years will likely rise by less than one degree F -- not exactly a catastrophe . '' Added Singer in a subsequent letter to the Canadian media , `` Thousands of scientists from many countries now fully understand that Kyoto and other efforts to control human emissions of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) are ineffective and entirely unfounded scientifically . `` Even if you ignore the enormous cost of Kyoto ( estimated recently by Prof. George Taylor of Oregon State University -- see http : //www.sitewave.net/news/s49p628.htm -- at one trillion U.S. dollars a year for full implementation in OECD countries ) , climate science research is rapidly moving AWAY from the hypothesis that the human release of greenhouse gases , specifically CO2 , is in any way significantly contributing to global climate change . '' Sun Called Primary Cause `` If we just look at the historical data , there is a scientific consensus that the global mean temperature has risen modestly during the twentieth century , '' said Myron Ebell , director of global warming and environmental policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute . `` The impacts have been small and probably beneficial in aggregate . This historical data puts the onus of demonstration on those who think this gradual warming trend will accelerate and lead to dire consequences . '' The controlling driver of global temperature fluctuations , according to Dr. Benny Peiser of England 's John Moore 's University , is solar ray activity . `` Six eminent researchers from the Russian Academy of Science and the Israel Space Agency have just published a startling paper in one of the world 's leading space science journals . The team of solar physicists claims to have come up with compelling evidence that changes in cosmic ray intensity and variations in solar activity have been driving much of the Earth 's climate , '' Peiser was quoted as saying in the May 17 National Post . Moreover , reports Peiser , Jan Veizer , one of Canada 's top earth scientists , published a comprehensive review of recent findings and concluded , `` empirical observations on all time scales point to celestial phenomena as the principal driver of climate , with greenhouse gases acting only as potential amplifiers . '' Added Peiser , `` In fact , the explicit and implicit rejection of the 'consensus ' is not restricted to individual scientists . It also includes distinguished scientific organizations such as the Russian Academy of Science and the U.S. Association of State Climatologists , both of which are highly skeptical of the whole idea . `` Heartland Institute - Article And here 's more : Renowned Scientist Defects From Belief in Global Warming & # 8211 ; Caps Year of Vindication for Skeptics October 17 , 2006 October 17 , 2006 Washington DC - One of the most decorated French geophysicists has converted from a believer in manmade catastrophic global warming to a climate skeptic . This latest defector from the global warming camp caps a year in which numerous scientific studies have bolstered the claims of climate skeptics . Scientific studies that debunk the dire predictions of human-caused global warming have continued to accumulate and many believe the new science is shattering the media-promoted scientific & # 8220 ; consensus & # 8221 ; on climate alarmism . Claude Allegre , a former government official and an active member of France & # 8217 ; s Socialist Party , wrote an editorial on September 21 , 2006 in the French newspaper L'Express titled & # 8220 ; The Snows of Kilimanjaro & # 8221 ; ( For English Translation , click here : U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works ) detailing his newfound skepticism about manmade global warming . See : http : //www.lexpress.fr/idees/tribune ... asp ? ida=451670 Allegre wrote that the & # 8220 ; cause of climate change remains unknown & # 8221 ; and pointed out that Kilimanjaro is not losing snow due to global warming , but to local land use and precipitation changes . Allegre also pointed out that studies show that Antarctic snowfall rate has been stable over the past 30 years and the continent is actually gaining ice . & # 8220 ; Following the month of August experienced by the northern half of France , the prophets of doom of global warming will have a lot on their plate in order to make our fellow countrymen swallow their certitudes , & # 8221 ; Allegre wrote . He also accused proponents of manmade catastrophic global warming of being motivated by money , noting that & # 8220 ; the ecology of helpless protesting has become a very lucrative business for some people ! & # 8221 ; Allegre , a member of both the French and U.S. Academy of Sciences , had previously expressed concern about manmade global warming . `` By burning fossil fuels , man enhanced the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which has raised the global mean temperature by half a degree in the last century , '' Allegre wrote 20 years ago . In addition , Allegre was one of 1500 scientists who signed a November 18 , 1992 letter titled & # 8220 ; World Scientists ' Warning to Humanity & # 8221 ; in which the scientists warned that global warming & # 8217 ; s & # 8220 ; potential risks are very great. & # 8221 ; See : Warning to Humanity Allegre has authored more than 100 scientific articles , written 11 books and received numerous scientific awards including the Goldschmidt Medal from the Geochemical Society of the United States . Allegre 's conversion to a climate skeptic comes at a time when global warming alarmists have insisted that there is a & # 8220 ; consensus & # 8221 ; about manmade global warming . Proponents of global warming have ratcheted up the level of rhetoric on climate skeptics recently . An environmental magazine in September called for Nuremberg-style trials for global warming skeptics and CBS News & # 8220 ; 60 Minutes & # 8221 ; correspondent Scott Pelley compared skeptics to & # 8220 ; Holocaust deniers. & # 8221 ; See : U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works & amp ; Scott Pelley And Catherine Herrick On Global Warming Coverage - Public Eye In addition , former Vice President Al Gore has repeatedly referred to skeptics as `` global warming deniers . '' This increase in rhetorical flourish comes at a time when new climate science research continues to unravel the global warming alarmists & # 8217 ; computer model predictions of future climatic doom and vindicate skeptics . 60 Scientists Debunk Global Warming Fears Earlier this year , a group of prominent scientists came forward to question the so-called & # 8220 ; consensus & # 8221 ; that the Earth faces a & # 8220 ; climate emergency. & # 8221 ; On April 6 , 2006 , 60 scientists wrote a letter to the Canadian Prime Minister asserting that the science is deteriorating from underneath global warming alarmists . & # 8220 ; Observational evidence does not support today 's computer climate models , so there is little reason to trust model predictions of the future & # 8230 ; Significant [ scientific ] advances have been made since the [ Kyoto ] protocol was created , many of which are taking us away from a concern about increasing greenhouse gases . If , back in the mid-1990s , we knew what we know today about climate , Kyoto would almost certainly not exist , because we would have concluded it was not necessary , & # 8221 ; the 60 scientists wrote . See : Open Kyoto to debate & # 8220 ; It was only 30 years ago that many of today 's global-warming alarmists were telling us that the world was in the midst of a global-cooling catastrophe . But the science continued to evolve , and still does , even though so many choose to ignore it when it does not fit with predetermined political agendas , & # 8221 ; the 60 scientists concluded.. : U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works : : Press Room : . So in conclusion , as the alleged science of evolution is based solely on pre-determined assumptions , so is the myth of Global Warming .	disagree	notsarc

But now we get to the actual definition of science . To me at least , science is how knowledge is acquired , different possibilities , and objectively examining these possibilities as well as publishing them to the public for scrutiny . So basically science is the answer to the question of why or how . Why is it that when an apple is dropped , it goes towards the Earth ? How fast does it go ? When I drop it does it really speed up as it goes along ? These are all matters of science , so basically almost everything in the world can be considered science , which is why I believe philosophy is considered a branch of science .	We could go back and fourth several times carefully picking and choosing words and phrases to describe what we think science should be , and possibly not disagree all that much . But to focus on this debates resolution , we need to get to what science is in schools today - a murky combination of facts and theories . Considering what Stephen Grocott had to say ( in the copy/paste in my first post ) about the definition of science , I do n't think we 're going to get it any clearer than that . Which facts and theories are emphasized to students and which ones are not are determined by the worldviews of the teaching establishment . Scientific facts can be taught without the worldview of the teacher being a factor , but scientific theories can not . Also , emphasizing one fact or theory over another will most likely reflect the worldview of the teacher , or the curriculum determined by the teaching establishment . So in an imperfect world , it 's clear that not all of what is taught as science is actually objective and non controversial .	disagree	notsarc

In short , I think this analogy needs to be reconsidered because of one important fact : a person who is brain-dead will never recover from that state no matter how much medical treatment is given , whereas an embryo who is `` brain-dead '' most certainly will fully recover from that state in a relatively short amount of time if left alone .	What you are talking about here is the *potential* to exist being important . I would personally also thinking that potential existence is important , but not nearly as important as an existing person . After all , unfertilized eggs and sperm also have the *potential* to become full people but no one is concerned about their loss . For many of us it is the actual mentally-existing person that is most important . For both the 'braniac '' case you present and for the early term fetus , if there is no reason to kill it , then do n't . However , if there is a contest between the rights of a living , existing person and the rights of either *potential* person , then I think the rights of the living person win out .	disagree	notsarc

the death penalty works . No convicted fellon excecuted by the state of Texas has evr gone on to kill again .	Capital Punishment and Deterrence : Examining the Effect of Executions on Murder in Texas . Authors John Sorenson , Robert Wrinkle , Victoria Brewer , and James Marquart examined executions in Texas between 1984 and 1997 . They speculated that if a deterrent effect were to exist , it would be found in Texas because of the high number of death sentences and executions within the state . Using patterns in executions across the study period and the relatively steady rate of murders in Texas , the authors found no evidence of a deterrent effect . The study concluded that the number of executions was unrelated to murder rates in general , and that the number of executions was unrelated to felony rates . ( 45 Crime and Delinquency 481-93 ( 1999 ) ) . Deterrence , Brutalization , and the Death Penalty : Another Examination of OklahomaÕs Return to Capital Punishment . In this study , author William Bailey speculated that if executions had a deterrent effect in Oklahoma , it would be observable by comparing murder rates and rates of sub-types of murder , such as felony-murder , stranger robbery-related killings , stranger non-felony murder , and argument-related killings , before and after the resumption of executions . Bailey examined the period between 1989 and 1991 for total killings and sub-types of killing . After controlling for a number of variables , Bailey found that there was no evidence for a deterrent effect . He did , however , find that there was a significant increase in stranger killings and non-felony stranger killings after Oklahoma resumed executions after a 25-year moratorium .

We 're off to quite a start , yes . When we `` extrapolate from the relativity intensities from the particular cells '' , we may have left the scientific world and entered the philosophical world . When we `` extrapolate '' , dictionary.com tells us that we ; `` infer ( an unknown ) from something that is known ; conjecture . '' and a conjecture is ; the formation or expression of an opinion or theory without sufficient evidence for proof . I 'm now slightly less confused about why I 've never seen this discussed before .	Inference is part of the scientific method -- probably the most important part , at that . Without it we would discover nothing , for we can prove very little to begin with . Bear in mind that `` proof '' is an extremely high standard . Proof is the level at which a proposition 's truth value is necessary ( ex : given how we define `` two , '' it is impossible for `` two '' to not be `` one '' plus `` one '' ) . Inference on the other hand is the only option outside of mathematics . With that in mind , the fact that we ca n't prove much of anything is more or less irrelevant ; what we can do is find lots and lots of supporting evidence and safely infer information from it .	neutral	notsarc

ABC aired a special on the effectiveness of CCW on campus . They had a student take a concealed weapons class ( who had never fired a gun before ) . After the class , they put him in a classroom with 20 or so people dressed in protective gear and face shields . They armed him with a simunition pistol ( a pistol that fires non-lethal rubber projectiles used for training ) . In the middle of a simulated college `` instruction period '' , a police SWAT team member charged in and started shooting . This was to conduct an `` experiment '' to see if students carrying concealed weapons was an effective means of stopping a mass killer . Guess what happened ? When the `` shooter '' busted into the classroom , the armed `` student '' immediately went for his gun , got it tangled in his shirt tail , and was shot with a simunition round . The conclusion reached by ABC and `` proven '' was that CCW was ineffective in a mass shooting scenario . DUH ! ! ! What a surprise ! A complete novice with only three hours of basic firearms experience was instantly killed by the TRAINED POLICE OFFICER WITH 15 YEARS EXPERIENCE AS A SWAT TEAM MEMBER ! Yup . Having an experienced CCW holder who is familiar with modes of carry , clearing concealment garments during presentation , basic defensive firing positions , and has practiced extensively with his firearm go against an emotionally imbalanced , drug or alcohol affected , common shooter is n't a real test .

If you understood his word you would know about them .	Well , if you make the argument that if someone took the time to write it , it must be true I 'm totally convinced !

By the way , if I 'm so dishonest about your claims making God a liar , why have you outright refused to explain your original argument ? `` Archangel , if you think you are so right , where is the evidence that the physical laws dictating how light behaves in a medium has changed in the past ? '' No reply . `` So God deceived us by creating a system that today works as we know it in a way that refutes Literal Creationism and has absolutely no evidence of being different at any time in the past but secretly made the named light sources abide to his secondary set of physical laws which he then removed from creation without a trace . '' How does that not make God an epic liar ? '' No reply . `` I 'm betting you do n't even understand your original argument . Prove me wrong .

'' I see you lack the intellectual guts to deal with # 1 , and instead went for # 2 on the grounds if Bible says = True ! The problem is that you remove your argument from the realm of actual science and rely entirely upon Magic and the Supernatural . Neither of which are testable or teachable in the science classroom . Where have I ever claimed to be a Christian ? More lies from the Lie Factory . Besides if such miracles happened , why is there no physical evidence left from the change in the physical laws ?

You 're kidding me ! You are actually comparing a buying a car to an abotion ? That 's hardly equal ! If someone regrets killing their child , then yeah why should they deny that to someone else when it could be positive for them ? ! Give me a break !	But that 's the argument you were presenting . The use of `` car '' is really irrelevant . You can substitute `` buying a car '' with any activity that one might engage in where they could later view it as positive or negative . The point is , you are attempting to use someones negative emotional view to argue aganist something that can be a positive experience for others . I was attempting to point out that yes , while you are entitled to have an opinion and share that opinion with everyone , this does not give you the right to determine what is right for others . If you find abortion to be that objectionable , great ... do n't ever have one . But do not try to use 1 persons negative viewpoint of abortion to tell others what they may or may not do . I am willing to bet that for every person you find who regrets their abortion that you would be able to find one person who found their abortion to be the right choice for them .

I do n't suppose any evolutionist have realized that all the evidence for evolution is also evidence for ID . They often talk about the mountains of irrefutable evidence , but the fact that the sun rose and set every day was evidence for the sun orbiting the earth , but it 's also evidence for the earth spinning . Likewise all the evidence for evolution can be condensed into one statement `` life forms are similar to other life forms '' , This is predicted by the intelligent design hypothesis as well . Direct evidence for ID that would not support evolution would be irreducibly complex biology , direct evidence for evolution that would not support ID would be more than just adaptation , it would have to be original useful DNA , or a simulation showing that coherent structure can be achieved without intelligent design by randomization and elimination .	The fact that the sun rises every day is not evidence for the sun orbiting the Earth , this effect is seen because of the rotation of Earth . ToE does not state that `` life forms are similar to each other '' . Direct evidence for ID/Creationism has never been established so there is no reason to suppose it to be true . Direct evidence for allele frequency change is freely available for all to see . You also need to define original , useful DNA . 4/10 . See me after class .	disagree	sarc

why the comparison of gun owners yo violent killers and serial rapists ? What law have I broken ?

Brooklyn , New York ( VBS.TV ) -- On January 22 , 2006 , the New York Times reported that all foreign journalists were being banned from Pakistan 's tribal areas , which has been called `` the most dangerous place in the world . '' A week before that , the CIA fired missiles remotely from a Predator aircraft into the Waziristan tribal area . They were hoping to eradicate a bunch of al Qaeda operatives . Instead , they killed 18 women and children . One week before that , I arrived in Pakistan to visit Darra Adamkhel , the massive open-air market located deep in the tribal areas , where a frighteningly high percentage of Islamic holy warriors goes to buy their guns . Gaining access to the tribal areas was next to impossible . It took months of pre-planning with the consul general of Pakistan in Montreal and top officials in Peshawar . They repeatedly denied us entry because , according to them , the Pakistani Army had too many `` sensitive operations '' going on in that region . Without my personal advantage ( a family friendship with the governor of the Northwest Frontier Province ) , we never would have gotten in . The government assigned me and my team a political agent named Naeem Afridi . He was born and raised in the tribal areas . He took care of us while we were there , and he was a godsend . You ca n't do anything in this part of the world without someone like Naeem . Our driver stopped at a security point just outside the town center , where we were introduced to the Frontier Agency militia , six angry-dad-looking guys with AKs and sidearms . They became our personal bodyguards , and followed us through the tight warren of gun shops and factories , barren little brick rooms where upward of 1,000 guns are manufactured every day . Most of the work is done by hand . The vendors are Pashtuns , who are basically the toughest people in the world . They comprised the majority of the mujahideen who kicked the Soviets out of Afghanistan in the late '80s . These days , the town is rumored to be completely overrun by the Taliban . They purchase the guns , then cross the border to fight the U.S. army in Afghanistan , or they drive through the mountains to the south to fight the Pakistani army . This summer , I went back to Pakistan , and found that the fuse on this powder keg has become even shorter . The Pakistani army has surged more troops into the tribal areas , attempting to eradicate the Taliban and al Qaeda . The U.S. and British troops are attempting to do the same thing on the other side of the border in Afghanistan . Meanwhile , Pakistan itself has seen violence spread to its major urban centers , where extremists have been detonating bombs and taking over police stations . But at the same time , there is a cultural explosion taking place , a vibrant art scene and metal and rock bands popping up everywhere . The whole situation has become ultra charged by the fact that there are tons of news channels operating uncensored by the insanely corrupt government . For Pakistan , it 's a volatile , turbulent , and fascinating moment in time .	So ... what was all that bull**** about terrorists exploiting America 's `` weak gun control laws '' in order to amass arsenals of deadly weapons ?

Gun registry has been a failure	THE ONLY QUESTION ABOUT GUN REGISTRATION by Alan Korwin Dear Editor , Only one thing is overlooked in the common-sense proposals to register guns , so here it is . How exactly would writing down my name , or your name , help arrest criminals or make you safer ? Although at first blush , gun listing has a sort of tantalizing appeal , on reflection you have to wonder whether gun lists would be an instrument of crime control at all . The unfortunate answer is that , no matter how good it feels when the words first pass your ears , registering honest gun owners does n't stop criminals , and in fact focuses in exactly the opposite direction . It is an allocation of resources that has no chance of achieving its goal , if that goal is the reduction of crime . 1 . Registering 70 million American households is extremely expensive . Do you know what it takes to run a database that big ? You need 19,000 changes daily , just to keep up with people who move every ten years . Floor after floor of cubicle after cubicle for employees with permanent jobs , payroll , parking and dry cleaning bills . It 's a government jobs program all by itself , all in the common sense -- but deceptive name -- of stopping crime . How many criminals do you figure will register when all is said and done ? That 's right , none , and the planners know that . All that money and time , invested on tracking the innocent . That 's why so many police departments are against it -- they 'll be forced to run huge data centers with their limited resources , and hire clerks instead of cops . 2 . Americans who fail to register would become felons without committing a crime . Under registration , activity that is a common practice and has been perfectly legal since inception makes you a felon . Think about that . Possession of private property would subject you to felony arrest , if the property is n't on the government 's master list . Boy , that does n't sound like the American way . No other evil is needed , there is no victim and no inherent criminal act takes place . Paperwork equals prison . That 's just wrong . 3 . Registration , if enacted , will create an underground market for unregistered guns bigger than the drug trade . How many times must an elite forbid what the public wants , before learning the unintended consequences of outlawing liberties ? People get what they want either way , it 's just a question of how much crime the government itself forces to accompany it . With respect to guns , the last thing you want to encourage is the creative import programs and price supports that drug dealers enjoy , for gun runners . 4 . People have said to me , `` But Alan , if all guns were registered and there was a crime , then you could tell . '' Tell what ? If your neighbor is shot , that 's not probable cause to search everyone with a matching caliber in a ten-block radius . The evidence needed to conclusively link a person to a crime has no connection at all to a registration plan -- you need motive , opportunity , witnesses , physical evidence , the murder weapon . Police are n't waiting for official lists so they can start catching murderers . Gun registration schemes lack a crime prevention component . 5 . You do n't really think authorities would use gun registration lists to confiscate weapons from people , do you ? Despite real-life examples recently of exactly that in New York , California and Louisiana , and global history for the past century , this could n't really happen , do you think ? Who would even support such a thing in a country like America , with its Bill of Rights ? The guarantees against confiscating property , unwarranted seizures and the right to keep and bear arms would surely forestall any such abuse of power . Are there really U.S. politician who would support firearm seizures ? ( Unfortunately , it 's a long list of usual suspects . ) And what about the so-called First Amendment test ? If it 's OK for arms it must pass muster for words too . Why would an honest writer object to being on the government list of approved writers ? Why indeed . Pile logic on logic , some people just feel the government should register everything , just to keep control . When government has that much control , you no longer possess your liberties . You 're living where government lists define who can do what , and where people control trumps crime control -- the gun registration model precisely . This form of `` gun control '' is n't about guns , it 's about control . I might favor registration if the system would include criminals . In fact , I 'd favor testing the system on them first . But the U.S. Supreme Court , in a widely known case ( Haynes v. U.S. , 1968 ) , had determined that a felon who has a gun can not be compelled to complete such forms , because it violates the Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination . That 's right , mandatory registration -- not in your case of course but in the case of a criminal -- is a self-indictment of a crime , and is therefore prohibited . * Gun listing is a feel-good deception that passes unquestioned by the `` news '' media , engorges the federal or state bureaucracy , and undercuts the linchpins of American freedoms . It has no more place in a free society than a government authorized list of words , and should be rejected outright . Elected officials who promote such a scheme are opposing the very Constitution they take an oath to preserve , protect and defend , and deserve to be removed from office . Sincerely , Alan Korwin , Author Gun Laws of America * NOTE : This case only concerned a limited class of weapons , `` destructive devices , '' which are listed and tracked in a special federal registry under the National Firearms Act . Congress rewrote that law after Haynes to require only the legal transferor , and not the transferee , of such devices to file papers , and along with other clever changes this overcame the 5th Amendment problem . In U.S. v. Freed , 1971 , the Court agreed the problem had been fixed ( for possession of hand grenades by criminals in that particular case ) . A general registration scheme would run into a greater problem . A prohibited possessor can not have a firearm at all , so mere possession is a serious crime . An additional charge for failing to register the gun that ca n't be possessed would offend the 5th Amendment the same as in the Haynes case . However , possession of an unregistered gun by an ordinary citizen would turn that citizen into a felon , with no other illegal act but the paperwork failure . The innocent would have to register to remain legal , the illegal possessor could not register without violating the right to not incriminate yourself .	neutral	sarc

SCHUMER : OK. Now , let me ask you this . When you wrote that statement , you did not -- as we discussed yesterday -- when you wrote that the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion , you had no exceptions . So that would mean , at least in 1985 , your view then , there would be no constitutional protection for a woman to terminate her pregnancy even if the termination was needed to preserve her future ability to have children , right ? ALITO : Senator , it was a general statement that did n't go into -- it did n't ... SCHUMER : But it had no exceptions . You did n't make that ... ALITO : It was one sentence , and it certainly did n't represent ... SCHUMER : There was no -- you did n't write any exception for that situation . Correct ? It just said the Constitution does not protect . It was without exception . And , yesterday , you did n't argue me when I mentioned that without exception . ALITO : I do n't recall your using the words without exception . SCHUMER : I think I did . ( CROSSTALK ) SCHUMER : If you believe ... ALITO : Could I just answer that question ? It 's one sentence and it certainly is not an attempt to set out a comprehensive view of the subject . SCHUMER : No , I understand that . But it was a very strong statement . It did n't talk about any exceptions at all . And the way I read that statement , even if a woman was raped by her father , she 'd have no constitutional protection to have an abortion and terminate that pregnancy . If you believe the Constitution protects no right to an abortion that would follow , would n't it ? ALITO : I think the statement speaks for itself , and it 's one sentence and it 's not an effort to set out a comprehensive view of ... SCHUMER : Knowing these examples , do you still refuse to distance yourself in any way from a broad , unqualified statement , without exception , that the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion ? No ands , ifs or buts , is my words . ALITO : What I actually said was that I was proud of my participation in the Thornburg case in which the government made the argument that it made in the Thornburg case ... SCHUMER : But you said in the previous sentence to that statement that you personally held those views . ALITO : That 's correct . But what I was talking about there was the Thornburg case and nothing more than the Thornburg case . SCHUMER : I understand . But you have n't rethought the position at all , even knowing these extreme cases and the hardship that it might cause ? ALITO : Well , what you have pointed out is exactly why , if the issue were to come up , and one were to get beyond stare decisis , the whole judicial decision-making process would have to be gone through . SCHUMER : You did n't think that through in 1985 ? ALITO : I was not involved in ... SCHUMER : When you wrote the statement . When you wrote that statement . ALITO : And when I wrote the statement what I was saying was that I was proud of what I had done in relation to the Thornburg case , which was to write the memo that the committee is aware of , which did not argue that Roe should be overruled , did not argue that the government should argue that Roe should be overruled , but that the decision should be challenged on other grounds that were quite similar . SCHUMER : I understand what you wrote , but you also -- we can bring the statement up here , but I do n't want to go over the thing of yesterday . I would just ask you to think of all the consequences of a broad statement , even from 1985 , that the Constitution does not protect the right to abortions . Not an exception of health of the mother , not an exception of rape or incest , not an exception of any of these others . I did n't see any of those in your job application . But I want to conclude on ... ALITO : Senator ... SCHUMER : Go ahead , please . ALITO : It was one sentence . And I think what you 're saying highlights the importance of not addressing this until the judicial process takes place where all of this complexity would be taken into account . SCHUMER : In all due respect , sir , I think it highlights the importance of an obligation to discuss it , particularly in light of a strong statement before . But we 'll have to differ on that .	Schumer is a bonafide XXXXX , as are many in the Senate . He failingly tried to draw Alito into exposing how he would rule on abortion if presented a case . Alito is far too intelligent to be logically trapped by a buffoon such as Shumer . It is also plain to see he interrupts when he supposes the response will indeed make sense against his flailings .	neutral	notsarc

Evolutionists have constructed the Geologic Column in order to illustrate the supposed progression of `` primitive '' life forms to `` more complex '' systems we observe today .

This does not mean that the column is fantastic nor imaginative . It may very well be that not all areas of the earth accumulated all types of rock that form the column ; this does not mean that the years at which similar columns were deposited in different places in the world are not similar .

Outrage at the tactics of `` The Advocate '' in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ...	Well , when I read the released portion of the transcript , it really looked like Kersey was acting on the understanding that the `` donor '' wanted to help African-American women who wanted to abort but could n't afford to go to an abortion clinic . ( Look at Kersey 's response to the `` donor '' 's question about `` underprivileged minority groups '' referring to `` women in need '' ; I guess Kersey is sexist , too ? ) Only later did the `` donor '' 's comments become strange .

The `` truth '' about atheism is that it 's the only proposition that makes sense ( apart from agnosticism ? ) to people who conclude , as I do , that religious principles are not based on reason . I know it 's a bit unusual in a public forum but I 'd like to introduce a little personal history here by way of illustration of my path to atheism : I was educated during my most impressionable years ( 11-18 ) at a grammar school controlled by the Jesuits . All my teachers were priests and many were of formidable intellect . Every morning began with `` divine service '' , every lesson was started and ended with a prayer . At noon we sang the Angelus and at 3.30 in the afternoon we finished the school day with Benediction . We had at least one session a day learning and reciting the catechism - so we could be word perfect in our answers to metaphysical questions . Yet all this religious conditioning failed to arouse any spark of faith in me . Sure , I conformed to all outward appearances , but inwardly I rebelled and I did not believe . So why did n't I believe - because my clergymen teachers gave me no REASONS to do so . When , eventually , during my last days at school I chose to reveal my disbelief - the Rector said , `` Well , after all , faith is a gift from God ! '' , and I had received no such gift . Since , in my view , there is no reasoned evidence for God 's existence , why succumb to wish-fulfillment ? It 's less comforting but more honest to be an atheist .	I 'm an atheist pretty much the same reason you are an atheist ( except for going to a religious school . I did n't really think it was fair and balanced at all . It protrayed atheists as lost from the true path . The reasons it gave for being atheist were they had n't found god yet , and a tradgedy . What about logically thinking about it ? And a RELIGIOUS STUDIES teacher says that atheism is just a phase ? They also say atheism is the easy way out . I think it 's easier to just believe in a god and be comforted . I 'm not saying people do but I 'd say Christianity is more of a quick fix than atheism . All you have to do is believe in god and you 're safe for your life and afterwards . Most Atheists do n't believe what they do just to rebel or have n't found God yet . Mostly it 's because they realized that there is no logical proof ( enough for them ) that there is God . They also said incorrectly that atheism is n't a religion . re·li·gion [ ri líjj ? n ] n 1. religion beliefs and worship : people ? s beliefs and opinions concerning the existence , nature , and worship of a deity or deities , and divine involvement in the universe and human life Microsoft® Encarta® Reference Library 2003 . © 1993-2002 Microsoft Corporation .

And if you want to go back to the earliest examples of horizontal transfer studies you need to study Crown Gall in plants caused by Agrobacterium tumifaciens .

Something that Agrobacterium appeared to transfer to plant cells which resulted in tumor like growth and so forth . He got a lot of funding by calling it `` Plant Cancer '' back then . What it turned out to be was transfer of plasmid borne genes to the plant tissue . Brauns work is absolutely classic . He got to the essential conclusions long before most of the tools of molecular biology were available . Think and experiment , use logic , do more experiments . He like Mendel managed to abstract what he was observing without being able to get down to the level of actual mechanisms . It turned out decades later that the plasmid in Agrobacterium forms a good basis for making genetically engineered plants . In the 1970s I had the pleasure of working with some of the people who uncovered the plasmid and watching the story emerge . Some of that story is told in the following by one of the Chiltons .

'' http : //academic.udayton.edu/race/01race/race.htm There are no genetic characteristics possessed by all Blacks but not by non- Blacks ; similarly , there is no gene or cluster of genes common to all Whites but not to non-Whites . One 's race is not determined by a single gene or gene cluster , as is , for example , sickle cell anemia . Nor are races marked by important differences in gene frequencies , the rates of appearance of certain gene types . The data compiled by various scientists demonstrates , contrary to popular opinion , that intra-group differences exceed inter-group differences . That is , greater genetic variation exists within the populations typically labeled Black and White than between these populations . This finding refutes the supposition that racial divisions reflect fundamental genetic differences . Along the way , various minds tried to fashion practical human typologies along the following physical axes : skin color , hair texture , facial angle , jaw size , cranial capacity , brain mass , frontal lobe mass , brain surface fissures and convolutions , and even body lice . As one scholar notes , `` [ t ] he nineteenth century was a period of exhaustive and -- as it turned out -- futile search for criteria to define and describe race differences . `` . . . Attempts to define racial categories by physical attributes ultimately failed . By 1871 , some leading intellectuals had recognized that even using the word `` race '' `` was virtually a confession of ignorance or evil intent . '' The genetic studies of the last few decades have only added more nails to the coffin of biological race .

But personally , I 'd rather see such sweeping cultural matters handled via the will of the people rather than an oligarchical court using judicial fiat to favor a minority over everyone else .

Read the preceding verse . `` 18 The LORD God said , 'It is not good for the man to be alone . I will make a helper suitable for him . 19 Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air . He brought them to the man to see what he would name them ; and whatever the man called each living creature , that was its name . 20 So the man gave names to all the livestock , the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field . But for Adam no suitable helper was found . '' ( Genesis 2:18-20 )	Okay , here is how it went : God made the animals . He said , '' Hey , Adam needs a helper . '' He brought the animals to Adam to name . He could n't find a helper for Adam . He then took a rib out of Adam 's side to create Eve . This was done on the sixth day . God created them both on the sixth day , Adam first , then Eve out of Adam 's side after he had Adam name the animals .	neutral	notsarc

I was watching the Bill Maher show today and they had Jane Fonda on . She mentioned that she has recently become a Christian and that HER god is one that supports a womens right to choice . Now there are so many problems with this that I do n't even know where to start . Not only that , I am saying this as almost a `` newbie '' Christian as in I do n't know everything there is to know about the Bible . However , I do know that the Christian God that is defined in the Bible is against abortion . Many argue that the Bible is not what the Christian God is because it has been translated into a meaningless document . How is this true when we have so many of the original scrolls ? Moreever , how can one claim what God thinks if they do n't have anything to base it on ? For example if you say the Bible is worthless , you are a Christian , and God believes abortion is ok ... then how did you come to this conclusion ? The Christian God talks about how one is created before they were put in the womb . God also talks about not killing . So if you wish to be Christian and for abortion you need to rethink one of those stances . God does n't conform to anyone .	Have you read the Old Testament ? In Numbers , God says do n't count any male child under one month old as a person . They also did n't count girls at all . He also had them burn Tamora while she was pregnant .	neutral	notsarc
The proof of the racism of Darwinism is overwhelming , if you do n't believe that you have never read Darwin .	Actually , Darwin was much less racist than was typical of the Victorian British of his day . Possibly you should read what Darwin had to say about his encounters with slavery in South America . Nevertheless , Darwin was a Victorian Englishman and his attitudes were colored by that culture , where Victoria was , by the Grace of God , Queen , and the head of the Church of England , which dominated the culture and academic life of the time . You know , the slavery that was propagated and approved by the European Christian churches . And , of course , the slave trade in the U.S. was supported and approved by the protestant churches . The Southern Baptist Convention was formed for the sole purpose of excluding blacks from the Christian churches . In 1997 the Southern Baptist Convention issued an official apology to African Americans for its history of racism . Of course , you are probably quite aware that the KKK was fromed by southern Christians - still is . There is also the Aryan Brotherhood , which also claims to be Christian . So I guess we could call that proof of the racism of Christianity . Of course you will squeal and cry about it and offer excuses , but facts are facts .	neutral	notsarc

We are separated by reasoning and compassion from the other animals . Theirs is a life based on instinct and a few learned behaviors . For every example you can give me of animals protecting their own young , I can likely present an example where the males ( sometimes the females ) will kill the young of their species just to keep down the competition . A domestic bitch , when presented with a weakling in a litter of pups , will eat the weakling .	Yes , a domestic bitch will eat a weak pup . Odlly enough wild dogs rarely do this ( the exception is generally a pup that either will not survive or in cases weher ethere is not enough food available to sustain the enitre litter , which generally menas the pup will not survive anyway .

The so called `` pro-choice '' movement is in fact in favour of only one choice , ie abortion . For example , a woman who telephones the `` British Pregnancy Advisory Service ( sic ) '' looking for help with a crisis pregnancy will not be given any help or advice . They only deal in abortions , performing over a quarter of all UK abortions . They will not even refer the woman to pro-life organisations such as Life . So much for choice !	Oh , you mean unlike the pro-life organizations that regularly refer women that come to them to pro-choice organizations ? I 'm being facetious , to get it out of my system , but seriously why would a `` pro-choice '' organization refer people to a `` pro-life '' organization when such organizations are regarded ( rightly or wrongly ) as `` pro-paternalism '' ? The claim that `` the so called `` pro-choice movement is in fact in favour of only one choice '' is certainly a important criticism that the pro-choice movement faces , because it is about supporting a woman 's choice to have an abortion . Unfortunately so much time and attention is devoted to protecting that choice that it overshadows the whole point of the pro-choice position : the woman 's right to choose . Too little time and attention is spent protecting a woman 's autonomy in making that choice or supporting a woman 's choice not to have an abortion . Fortunately in Canada , where abortion is legal , the pro-choice movement is quickly recognizing that providing women with the information and support to make an informed decision either way is just as important as providing the means to exercise one choice . I 'm pointing this out because I think you may be mistaking the pro-choice 's struggle to keep the abortion option open with what the pro-choice movement is actually in favour of : the informed choice of a woman with regard to how she wants to deal with pregnancy .	disagree	sarc

What harm will come to society from the marriage of gays ? The most significant impact of legally recognizing same-sex unions would be more indirect . Expanding the definition of what `` marriage '' is to include relationships of a homosexual nature would inevitably , in the long run , change people 's concept of what marriage is , what it requires , and what one should expect from it . These changes in the popular understanding of marriage would , in turn , change people 's behavior both before and during marriage .

Because in order to mantain a healthy environment for children . ( which they always seem to want to adopt ) there has to be a healthy relationship . Now a child grows up , and sees two men/women dating eachother . That can confuse the child as to whether they should also be gay . It is not only harmful to the family environment , but also to society . And do n't hand me that , '' My uncle is gay . '' Stuff . I had ( he passed away ) a gay uncle , have three gay cousins , and a gay aunt . Not my whole family is not gay , but it seems like I have quite a few in my family . Now I do n't support what they do . Even though I love them because they are my family , I would not support them if they were to marry .	And what evidence do you have that having two gay parents would confuse a child about weahter they should be gay ?

What are the reasons which you would present behind the statement `` all human life is sacred '' ( or whichever similar statement you think is the core of your pro-life stance ) ? If morality is based only on arbitrary proclamations , then there is little chance of consensus because other groups or religions come up with other arbitrary set of rules and we are back to the situation of , in the worst case , chaos and , in the best case , a majority imposing arbitrary rules on an unwilling suffering minority . I suspect that a lot of people , if not most people , at least partially follow some version of `` treat others as you would have yourself be treated '' . When , as children , we were scolded `` How would you like it if ... '' that is a tactic of teaching this rule . For those who are religious ( which I only marginally , occasionally and hesitatingly am ) , even Jesus stated `` Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you . '' in the Sermon on the Mount talk ( as quoted by ShadowPikachu ) . Many world religions and philosophies seem to incorporate that general rule , which is partly why I think it has a reasonable chance at being incorporated as a global base of morality .	Jyoshu pretty much answered for me so I wo n't go back but I will say that your morality is formed based on arbitrary things as well . Whether you believe in a god or make yourself god you still are making arbitrary rules for which you develop a morality . The idea that you do n't want to suffer and therefore came up with this morality is abritrary as everything we have stated . Why was n't the conclusion `` I dont ' want to suffer so be stronger than everyone else '' or `` I do n't want to suffer so do n't associate with anyone else '' . Or maybe the conslusion could be to believe in a religion . Either way , you are going to have to believe in something and that forms the basis for a morality .	agree	notsarc

You folks ca n't box with God , your arms ai n't long enough . Many arguments are made about whether creation or evolution should be taught in our schools . I believe in creationism because I have never met an evolutionist who can explain where the very first sign of life came from . Can something not alive give birth to life ? Can something not alive change to be alive ? The answer to both questions is NO ! There are many things I do n't know , but two things I do know are science will never create anything from nothing and science will never create life from nonlife . I still think that it takes more faith to believe in evolution than it does to believe in our creator	You are making a crucial mistake ... you are assuming there is a black and white line dividing the living from the non-living . This is a grey area . What is life ? Is a dog alive ? What about the fleas on the dog ? What about the bateria on the fleas ? What about the virus in the dog ? Is a virus a non-living organism since it can not reproduce in a conventional manner ? When you look at it critically , there is no living/non-living line . It is easy to see a gradation from what can be reasonably called non-living to what can reasonably called `` living '' .	neutral	sarc

A baby who is born is able to breathe and eat and live physically separated from another human being . Whether you think it matters or not is a different story , but a fetus is most definitely not as viable as a baby up until , well it varies - 38 weeks for sure and the probability is progressively less with each fewer number of weeks .

The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics began at the Fall . This law says that the entropy ( disorder ) of the Universe increases over time , and some have thought that this was the result of the Curse . However , disorder isnt always harmful . An obvious example is digestion , breaking down large complex food molecules into their simple building blocks . Another is friction , which turns ordered mechanical energy into disordered heatotherwise Adam and Eve would have slipped as they walked with God in Eden ! A less obvious example to laymen might be the sun heating the Earthto a physical chemist , heat transfer from a hot object to a cold one is the classic case of the Second Law in action . Also , breathing is based on another classic Second Law process , gas moving from a high pressure to low pressure . Finally , all beneficial processes in the world , including the development from embryo to adult , increase the overall disorder of the universe , showing that the Second Law is not inherently a curse . Death and suffering of nephesh animals before sin are contrary to the Biblical framework above , as are suffering ( or groaning in travail ( Rom . 8:2022 ) ) . It is more likely that God withdrew some of His sustaining power ( Col. 1:1517 ) at the Fall so that the decay effect of the Second Law was no longer countered .

You are using the logical fallacy of 'equivication ' . While a scientific theory is an 'educated ' guess in some respects , it is much more than that . A scientific theory is a model to explain the observed facts , is testable , has been throughly tested , has explainatory powers , and has not been able to be falsified . That makes it much more than a mre 'educated guess ' .	Actually you are incorrect . I have heard this explanation before and at the risk of being rude its given by people who do n't actually under stand what is meant by `` testing a theory . '' You can not successfully test a theory . Once a theory has been successfully tested it is no longer a theory . When sceince refers to testing a theory it 's a process of creating an experiment using what they do know to find out what they do n't know , but it never proves the theory . It can often find another peice of the puzzle that when theorized can help support the theory , but that is not surprising given the theory was used as the experimental modul . As such the tests only provide additional information ( or education ) for the educational guess . Unfortuantly mathmatics and sceince use testing a theory in different ways and the layaman often confuses the two . In Mathematics it is possible to test and retest using different mathematical variables and come up with numerous examples of success and it still be a theory . The reason for this is that mathematics in itself is theoretical . By that meaning it is non-physical and can only be approximated . However such is not the case for science . I would not go so far as claim you are being equivocative because I think its ignorance not misrepresentation on your part . However , Thats the last I will talk about the term theory either people can accept the definition or not . Even if they disagree if they can not discuss within that frame work quite frankly they probably arent at the educational/critical level to discuss the concepts . If someone wants to prove me wrong simply give me a scientific theory that has been successfully tested .	disagree	notsarc

How about : A woman wakes up to find herself connected to a body . A body without a brain , which is using her own organs to be alive . Doctors are preparing to transplant a brain from a dying violinist into this new one connected to her and the date is set in the future . Would it be morally correct to disconnect herself and kill this body that has no identity , mind , consciousness or existence in actuality ?	Yes , in my view , it would be morally correct since it has no brain and , in my definition , is not a person with rights . However , if she does n't want to support the violinist in that future , she has the responsibility to disconnect from ( and therefore kill ) that brainless body before the brain gets transplanted . Otherwise , if she waits to disconnect until it is too late , she would be guilty of killing the violinist ( a person ) .	neutral	notsarc

You 're never going to convince pro-lifers that the intential termination of a pregnancy is ok ( save maybe in a few instances ) . Why would you think that pro-lifers would see this as an `` alternative . '' What is it an alternative to . It 's obviously not an alternative to the intentional termination of the natural process of pregnancy , which is what pro-lifers object to .	Well , I am not really going to convince anyone in anything - the info I placed in this thread is for consideration . Whether someone in need will decide to act based on that info - is his personal choice . Dry fasting is an alternative to the intentional termination of the first pregnancy because it turns this `` termination '' into a process that has nothing to do with criminal practices of modern days doctors . To make things more clear I will attempt to put it in adored by many `` good citizens '' terminology . The girl who is pregnant for the first time and enters the dry fasting kind of `` asks the God for forgiveness '' . It 's not a secret to anyone that young people do make mistakes , and often that happens just because there were neither parents no society who was able to teach them some basic things about sex and elementary spiritual safety practices . Even a fool can understand that , why would n't a God ? One can think of it as if the girl asks God to postpone her time of having a child : there is no killing , no crime . When the embryo dissolves a human has no relation to this process , it is the decision of the organism , it is the decision of those Above . And in case of a first pregnancy this decision is : the soul of a baby goes back , it may have another opportunity to incarnate into the human body .

Anyway , my perfect image of God has cost me years of pain with a more recent almost crippling of my right leg followed by 7 hours of surgery ( including 11 inches of surgical incision - front and back ) to correct my perfection by removing the debris left by two disintegrating disks and inserting two steel frame disks and screwing two steel rods into my vertebrae in the gutter on either side of my spine . The muscles that used to lie in those gutters are sutured over the top , and they are not happy with their new position .	i 'm truly sorry to hear about your pain and i hope your recovery comes soon . i think the most popular justification people give for their atheism ( i 'm not saying youre an atheist ) is `` if God exist , why is their so much pain/suffering/ [ negativity ] '' . this justification apeals to the majority of `` layman '' ateists more than anything else last week my wife took our 2-year old son to the store . on the way back , just as they were coming to the entrance of our building , she let go of his hand so he could run ahead inside . instead , he ran down the sidewalk , between 2 parked cars and into the street . at the same time a car was coming up the street , didnt even see our son , and never even slowed down . when my wife ran out to get him , he had stayed close to the parked car and out of the way . had he run into the street he would have vry likely been killed . this somehow miraculous escape from tragedy has strengthened my wife 's faith in God strange enough , if ( God forbid ) things had gone wrong and our son had stopped in the middle of the street , it is very likely that she would question God 's existence . this is also the reason why atheism is more like a religion . through emotional experiences , rather than deduction and reasoning , people decide whether God exists or not . it also has to do with perception , since there are christians who suffer afflictions similar to yours , and it only strengthens their faith . yes , emotional stimuli affect all of us , usually with more impactful effects than physical trauma . and yes , we expect a God of spiritual power to appeal to us at least in the emotional sense ( since it is the only form of contact believers have with God anyway ) , and if God can not be there on an emotional level , then is he really there at all ? i think its incorrect to determine that God exists ( or not ) solely on the tragedy that we experience . a miraculous escape from death does not strengthen the case for God 's existence . likewise , a devastating tragedy does not strengthen the case for his non-existence	neutral	notsarc
funny that all proponents of abortion for unwanted pregnancies talk about abortion as if being a political statement : I control my body .

So , you think there is a God ? Bad design does not equate to no design . It really is a poor argument . Much of the force of Darwin 's arguments deal with bad design . I invite anyone to post any of Darwin 's arguments that specifically outline his case against design because of `` bad '' design . That said , consider this , your car is said to operate at 25 % fuel efficiency . One could claim then the car is 75 % bad design , therefore it is not designed , and if it is , certainly not by anyone of any intelligence . Your audio CD 's have Reed-Solomon error correction because the read/write process is full of errors that need correcting . Cleary this is `` bad design '' that engineers would create read/write heads that make so many errors in the first place . Same with modems and host of other devices . Clearly if in the remote chance these bad designs are evidence of design , the designers must be clueless ! Poorly designed dramas have villains and heroes . Clearly a drama ( even a divine drama ) is poorly designed if it has villains in the story . All the characters should be Pollyanna and there should be no great tragedies on the road to a happy ending . Life and the Divine drama , like CD 's and cars , are clearly not designed , or at least not designed by anyone with intelligence , because of all the bad design woven into the designs . The reason audio CD 's have so many read/write errors which are corrected Reed-Solomon error correction ( somewhat like us reading someone 's writing and mentally correcting spelling and grammar errors ) is that it is the most optimal way to get as much data on a CD as possible . The tightest packing of data implies the highest amount of errors based on the Shannon capacity theorem . The Mp3 's and JPEGS are even more `` error '' prone in that they are inexact representations of the original sound or picture , but the goal was not fidelity but compactness . A similar consideration is for the 75 % inefficiency for cars . The goal is for higher acceleration and agility and cost , etc. , not fuel efficiency . The point is `` bad '' design , in the grand scheme of things , might not be bad design after all . The high rate of sickness and death , the eventual death of the universe as predicted by the 2nd law of thermodynamics are not evidences that the Designer is unwise , any more than the many errors in the read/write process of audio CD suggests the engineers of those devices are incompetent . Origin of Species Chapter 13 : There is another and equally curious branch of the present subject ; namely , the comparison not of the same part in different members of a class , but of the different parts or organs in the same individual . Most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous with that is correspond in number and in relative connexion with the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae . The anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and articulate classes are plainly homologous . We see the same law in comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans . It is familiar to almost every one , that in a flower the relative position of the sepals , petals , stamens , and pistils , as well as their intimate structure , are intelligible in the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves , arranged in a spire . In monstrous plants , we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another ; and we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals , and in flowers , that organs which when mature become extremely different , are at an early stage of growth exactly alike . How inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation ! Why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone ? As Owen has remarked , the benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition of mammals , will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of birds . Why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the wing and leg of a bat , used as they are for such totally different purposes ? Why should one crustacean , which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts , consequently always have fewer legs ; or conversely , those with many legs have simpler mouths ? Why should the sepals , petals , stamens , and pistils in any individual flower , though fitted for such widely different purposes , be all constructed on the same pattern ? On the theory of natural selection , we can satisfactorily answer these questions . Homology was a pre-darwinian idea with the term coined by Owen who rather despised Darwin and his ideas . Darwin tries to argue why a Designer would not use the same for the same function . He says homology is evidence of an unwise design . The premise is a Creator would n't be so inefficient . But , unless one has a handle on the teleological goal , one is free to fabricate all manner of `` bad design '' arguments ( for example read/write errors in audio CD 's or fuel inefficient cars ) . The Biotic Message Theory suggest the teleological goal for biotic reality is to communicate to humans that there is one Designer and author of life , and that life could not have evolved . Like a great novel , the `` imperfections '' of biology are part of a larger plot . It is turning out , Darwin 's argument from homology is a concept in crisis .	You are assuming that the TOE of evolution has remained static since Darwins time . I have to say that is false . We have 150 years of experimental data beyond that . In addition , we not only have the arguement from homology , but we have genetic data to back it up . So sorry , but you struck out .	disagree	notsarc

The genomic origins and the associations of human nuclear and cytosolic polyadenylated RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides ( nt ) and whole-cell RNAs less than 200 nt were investigated in this genome-wide study . Subcellular addresses for nucleotides present in detected RNAs were assigned , and their potential processing into short RNAs was investigated . Taken together , these observations suggest a novel role for some unannotated RNAs as primary transcripts for the production of short RNAs . Three potentially functional classes of RNAs have been identified , two of which are syntenically conserved and correlate with the expression state of protein-coding genes .

For obvious reasons we Christians have always been adamant supporters of civil liberties when it comes to freedom of religion . We have even managed to be consistent in this principle by not opposing the rights of Buddhists , New Agers , or even Satanists to meet , because we realize that to do so would equally undercut our own right to assemble . Perhaps the thought of undermining religious freedom sends through our minds flashes of those days when the Emperor Nero used to ignite Christians as human torches to light the streets of Rome at night . The persecutions against the early church have ingrained into our Christian consciousness the incredible value of living under a government that protects the interests of religion . But in the case of civil same-sex marriage , instead of recognizing the civil rights issue at stake here , we oppose the idea , quoting Bible verses and appealing to morals , nature , tradition , history , and the fear that Western civilization as we know it will come crashing to the ground . All of these arguments are related , of course . They are an appeal to that part of American society in which Judeo-Christian values are still deeply rooted . For even in America at the dawning of the 21st century , many people 's understanding of morality and nature still reflect the vestiges of the Western Christendom of our heritage , as do their ideas of tradition , history and an ideal society . We do not , however , argue against civil same-sex marriage in the spirit of calm persuasion . There is desperation in our tone . There is also a great deal of fear and mean-spiritedness in our rhetoric , to the point where we even accuse homosexuals ( without much proof , I might add ) of being child molesters and sexual predators , and of seeking to corrupt our youth by recruiting them into their `` lifestyle . '' There are probably many people who think they are justified in having such fears , but it seems to me it is more than just paranoia that feeds our frenzy . We feel deeply threatened , for we sense that we are losing the battle . Not simply the battle against homosexuals , but the battle to hang on to what we still think of as `` Christian America . '' At one time in this country we could count on quoting a verse from Genesis or Leviticus before Congress or the Supreme Court and that would be the end of the debate . No more . The consensus of common biblical values on which we had once depended is giving way to the pluralism of a postmodern society . And seeing the disastrous handwriting on the wall , we have become politically desperate , and so we lunge at the enemies of Christendom with a ferocity that rivals that of even the most radical gay activists .

Gun hater pilot will then say hey we have police to protect us , so why do people need guns to defend themselves . Gun hater pilot will then say we have grocery store so why do people need to hunt ? Gun hater pilot will then say why do you need to target shoot if you no longer need guns to hunt or defend yourself ? Gun hater pilot will continue adding why do you need guns reasons until the reason gun hater pilot said are gone . It is always interesting how gun haters like gun hater pilot apply the common sense lie to banning the right to bear arms . What gun hater pilot will never apply the common sense thing is to demand that dangerous criminals be removed from the streets of America to make it safe .

Is your point that citizens should be allowed to have guns to defend themselves from the government or that citizens should be allowed to have guns to protect themselves from other citizens ? As for protecting form the government , I highly doubt that the U.S. military would be used to massacre U.S. citizens because its actions are far too public . It certaintly is possible that a more secretive organization such as the NSA would be able to carry out plans such as the ones which you described in other countries . However , do you think it would be possible for ordinary citizens armed with firearms to stop the highly trained employees of the NSA ? As for protection from other citizens , I think that the government should allow this , but I also think that people should n't have guns . So if the number of guns owned by citizens in the U.S. were to decrease , I would want it to be a voluntary change , not one forced by the government . There should still be gun regulation just as there is regulation of any product on the market .	You might want to pick up a history book and read it . Try reading both the Federalist and Anti-Federalist Papers for starters . If you were familiar with them , then you would 've already had the answer to your first question . Your selective memory is at work again . As I recall , in Waco military vehicles and equipment were used against the Branch Davidians . Nevermind the presence of members of Delta Force which was denied , at first , by the government . Then they were caught lying again about using flammable tear gas which , ironically enough , is banned by the Geneva Convention for use against enemy troops . In the end , the 'open and shut case ' the government thought they had , blew up in their faces because of their lies and abuses . I also recall , at some point around the time of the Great Depression that U.S. troops were called out to quell food riots in New York , I think it was . There were a couple of young officers present by the name of MacArthur and Patton , I believe . There are a few other instances I 'm sure . I note your glee about secret agencies and their awesome firepower in which mere citizens would be defenseless against . Is your closet full of brown shirts ? You must be proud . Huh ? You 're for protecting yourself against other citizens as long as it does n't involve guns ? Of course , that would n't apply to the criminal that you 're protecting yourself against ! Why do n't you read how well your gun bans are working in other countries ? Regulation ? The only regulation should be mandatory firearms training for all citizens like in Switzerland . Not the 'regulation ' that you liberals would propose which , of course , always leads to an outright ban of private ownership . Why do you fear the 'people ' ? It does n't matter what you think , the second amendment is clear enough all by itself . Try reading the Constitution again .	neutral	sarc

I really have to commend AIG in that they did not list `` Dr. '' Kent Hovind , `` Dr. '' Carl Baugh , `` Dr. '' Don Patton .

Dying Lesbian 's Partner Denied Access To Her by 365Gay.com Newscenter Staff Posted : February 22 , 2008 - 1:00 pm ET ( Miami , Florida ) Janice Langbehn and Lisa Pond had planned to take their three children on a family cruise . The Olympia , Washington couple had been together 18 years and with their children were looking forward to the holiday . But just as they were about to depart on the cruise from Miami , Florida . Pond , a healthy 39-year-old , suddenly collapsed . She was rushed to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami with Langbehn and the children following close behind . But once Langbehn and the children arrived at the hospital the hospital refused to accept information from her about Pondss medical history . Langbehn says she was informed that she was in an antigay city and state , and she could expect to receive no information or acknowledgment as family . A doctor finally spoke with Janice telling her that there was no chance of recovery . Other than one five minute visit , which was orchestrated by a Catholic priest at Langbehns request to perform last rites , and despite the doctors acknowledgement that no medical reason existed to prevent visitation , neither she nor her children were allowed to see Pond until nearly eight hours after their arrival . Soon after Pond's death , Langbehn tried to get her death certificate in order to get life insurance and Social Security benefits for their children . She was denied both by the State of Florida and the Dade County Medical Examiner . http : //www.365gay.com/Newscon08/02/022208fla.htm Note the above . She was informed she was in an `` anti-gay state '' ... 1 ) As I have pointed out before , some of the `` anti-gay marriage '' amendments go well and beyond just `` no gay marriage '' to antagonizing gays by stating in law that gays can not perform certain legal functions , regardless of whether or not it is called `` marriage '' . 2 ) Does anybody have any real doubt that if the two ladies had just walked in as `` friends '' , that this problem would not have happened ? 3 ) I think this furthers my point regarding how some people 's actions and statements FURTHER anti-gay bullying , and that refusing to acknowledge this relationship , or `` blame '' , is futile . The hospital perpetrated this gross violation of human decency invoking the STATE stance .	Whether this has anything to do with marriage or not , it is deplorable that A PERSON who loves another person should be denied a hospital visit for any reason other than concerns related to health . The hospital staff erred in denying the visits , especially those of the children . The denial of the partner 's bedside visit is also deplorable . There is no legitimate reason to deny a peaceful visit from any friend or family member to the bedside of a dying person unless it would negatively affect the health and well being of either party . If it positively affects the health and well being of either of them , it should certainly be permitted . I think the hospital staff should be chastised and punished to the point of remembering this incident forever as a reason to relax their prejudices and get with the program . There is nothing wrong with gay/lesbian people that love and understanding can not cure .	neutral	notsarc
Thats the face of human nature that make it all too easy to accept without realizing that a controversy even exists , and it does exist . If it didnt , evolutionists wouldnt be afraid of challenges .	So what you 're saying is that if ID really were worthless non-science , we 'd be able to tell because everyone would be happy for it to be taught alongside evolution in science class ? Yeah , that makes perfect sense Hopefully you can now see how far we 've meandered around the disparate issues . Let 's recap : 1 . Can looking for intelligent design be scientific ? One can apply the scientific method to any study . So far , the results of that application to ID ( largely through peer review ) indicate that it is not logically possible to positively infer the presence of design in a biological structure . 2 . Is the work the ID movement has produced rigorous , and are its results significant ? No . The fundamentally flawed assumption that irreducible complexity can not be achieved by evolutionary means invalidates all derivative results , and Dembski 's 'specified complexity ' is neither consistent , measurable , nor meaningful . Several structures claimed to represent evidence of design have admitted to evolutionary paths ( including , ironically , some of the analogies used in their literature in an attempt to illustrate things design alone can accomplish ) 3 . Should ID be opposed as a scientific endeavour ? Of course not . We only ever learn by imagining ; by striking out in unexpected and even seemingly absurd directions - just so long as we 're rigorous in our logic and our testing . I do n't think design science would ever bear useful fruit , but I would never oppose someone pursuing it . 4 . Should ID as it stands be taught as an alternative to evolution in science classrooms ? Absolutely not . It presently stands on a par with hypotheses about the 'electric universe ' , or firey comets flying out of the sun , or any number of inventive , potentially appealing , but utterly unsubstantiated notions . Its few published results have been obliterated in peer review and there 's quite simply nothing there to teach .	disagree	sarc

In fetal development , most major organs exist in rudimentary form by about 8 to 9 weeks . It takes several months for these organs to grow in size , complexity , and organization to the point they can function . For example , the myelin sheaththe insulating cover on nerve pathways that is required for efficient conduction of pain signalsdoes not begin forming around nervous system cells ( neurons ) in the spinal cord until about 24 weeks , and not till after birth in most of the cerebral cortex . [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] Although sporadic brain waves can be detected by about 21 weeks gestation , genuine continuous brain waves do not begin until about 28 weeks , [ 9 ] indicating that the nerve circuits needed to carry pain impulses to the brain are not fully connected till then .

Today , almost half a century after the publication of the encyclical ( Humani Generis ) , new knowledge has led to the recognition of the theory of evolution as more than a hypothesis . ( Aujourdhui , près dun demi-siècle après la parution de l'encyclique , de nouvelles connaissances conduisent à reconnaitre dans la théorie de l'évolution plus qu'une hypothèse . ) It is indeed remarkable that this theory has been progressively accepted by researchers , following a series of discoveries in various fields of knowledge . The convergence , neither sought nor fabricated , of the results of work that was conducted independently is in itself a significant argument in favor of this theory .	The statement was made in an address to the Pontifical Acacemy of Sciences in 1996 . It is clear that the Pope considers the theory of evolution to be valid . However , this is not a an encyclical and not a statement ex cathedra . Therefore it is not a statement of doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church . However , he is stating that , recognizing a restriction , the theory of evolution does not contradict Christian faith . He reaffirmed the statement made by Pius XII of that restriction .

President Obama poses a real and present danger to the Second Amendment , and he 's working to pack the Supreme Court with justices who will undermine Americans ' gun rights . Mr. Obama did n't fess up to this radical agenda when running for the highest office in the land . `` I have said consistently that I believe that the Second Amendment is an individual right , and that was the essential decision that the Supreme Court came down on , '' Mr. Obama told Fox News in June 2008 . Despite the campaign rhetoric , Mr. Obama is appointing judges who strongly oppose that position . The most recent pick , Elena Kagan , ran much of President Clinton 's war on guns from 1995 to 1999 . When Ms. Kagan served as Mr. Clinton 's deputy domestic policy adviser , she was a feverish proponent of gun control . From gunlock mandates to gun-show regulations , she was instrumental in pushing anti-gun policies , according to the Los Angeles Times . Every court nomination counts . Two years ago , the Supreme Court barely mustered a narrow 5-4 majority to strike down the extreme District of Columbia gun ban . Should Justice Anthony Kennedy or one of the four more conservative justices retire or die while Mr. Obama is in office , the high court likely will undo such narrow victories for the Second Amendment . While Ms. Kagan was nominated to replace the liberal Justice John Paul Stevens , and thus wo n't swing the court in a new direction , her being there will necessitate that gun owners concentrate more than ever on fighting outright gun bans . Ms. Kagan 's defenders acknowledge her liberal political views but claim that as a judge , the former Harvard Law School dean will somehow manage to separate her judgments from her political opinions . The hitch is that her legal views correspond with her political views . When Ms. Kagan clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall , she wrote , `` I 'm not sympathetic '' to the claim that `` the District of Columbia 's firearms statutes violate [ an individual 's ] constitutional right to 'keep and bear Arms . ' `` Her memos to Justice Marshall foreshadow an activist judge who would n't hesitate to fall back on her own personal views to override policy decisions made by elected officials . She clearly counseled Justice Marshall on how he should rule based upon whether she thought policies made `` sense . '' Take her advice in the case of Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council , in which an appeals court stopped federal agencies from issuing a permit to build a ski lodge in a national forest . Ms. Kagan might feel that stopping ski resorts from such building makes `` policy sense , '' but that is n't the job of a judge . Ms. Kagan is Justice Sonia Sotomayor 's soul sister when it comes to gun control . Last year , during her confirmation hearings , Ms. Sotomayor insisted the Supreme Court had never found that an individual right to self-defense exists . Two of Justice Sotomayor 's own appeals court decisions came to the same conclusion . One ruling denied there is an individual right to self-defense . In another case , even after the Supreme Court struck down the District 's gun ban , Judge Sotomayor opined that any restrictions on self-defense would pass constitutional muster so long as politicians who passed it said they had a good reason . Senators must realize that a vote for Ms. Kagan for the Supreme Court is another vote against gun rights .	Anyone who votes for Kagan might as well tender their resignation .	neutral	sarc
Is n't a dead person also still human ?	I think the definition of human , in context , would be a person that is alive . Dead does not make them human in this context . Scientifically , human may mean Homo Sapiens , but there are other methods of defining humans . One of them is their capacity to love and to worship . Worship is not seen in another animal . Some will argue whether or not animals actually love or if it is just a conditioned response to someone providing what is needed . Either way , loving and worship are behaviors and as my psychology prof used to say ... ... . '' Dead people do n't behave . ''	neutral	notsarc

When I was in college a particularly difficult physics professor gave us the task of proving the existance of the wind . Interestingly enough , it can not be done . You can not see it , you can not catalog it , and you can not touch it . You can not measure it , though you can measure its effects . you can not write any proof for the existance of the wind . While many people may argue that you CAN proove the existance of the wind by observing its effects , this is not really a valid way to a proof in physics . In the end , it comes down to faith . We can see the effects of the wind , we can feel the effects of the wind , so we believe it is there .	actually , proof of something comes down to 2 things : agreeing on what the definition of the thing is , and agreeing on evidence that verifies the thing wind is defined as movement of air . air moves , therefore wind exists . this has been proven . i dont know what kind of definition you used , but it doesnt seem like your assignment is that difficult . God , on the other hand , is elusive even at the definition stage . he is sometimes defined as creator of the world , a higher force , all-powerful , greatest being possible , love , etc ... unless a definition is agreed upon , even beginning to prove existance is difficult . suppose we define God as love . love exists , therefore God exists . however , not everybody agrees to this definition . suppose we define God as creator of the universe . sciences states the the universe was created spontaneously , therefore God doesnt exist . therefore , for some , either this definition is not satisfactory or the conclusion of the scientists isnt satisfactory . finding proof for the existence of God becomes increasingly difficult when Gods definition gets constantly revised and adjusted . if we could simply agree on the definition for God then we could begin to find a proof .	disagree	notsarc

Hello , Nu Leader . Nor was the peppered moth example ever meant to `` prove '' evolution . One important part of the theory of evolution is the hypothesis that natural selection is the major driving force behind it . So , the peppered moth observations were meant to show that natural selection can have a significant effect on the relative frequency of genotypes .	Almost all textbooks on evolution include the peppered moth as the classic example of evolution by natural selection . http : //www.clcoc.org/news/peppered.htm `` The peppered moth , Biston betularia ( L. ) , is one of some 20,000 moth species found in the United Kingdom . It became a famous example of evolution by means of natural selection . after the Industrial Revolution . The typica variety of the moth is white with black speckles and is a striking lichen mimic . '' http : //wiki.cotch.net/wiki.phtml ? title=Peppered_moth For years the story of the peppered moth , Biston betularia , has provided one of the best-known examples of natural selection in action . http : //www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/Moths/moths.html Although I failed High School biology I do remember that the peppered moth was given to us as an example of evolution at work . And it did n't show anything about the frequency of genotypes , because the population has been producing the same moths . If all you can show that a moth population changes colour , then again , then back again how is this anything remotely like evolution ? It is still being taught ... http : //www.bethtfiloh.com/biology9pepperedmoth.htm But it does n't explain much . `` Most biologists , however , believe that natural selection is responsible , though no one knows what traits are being selected or what factors in the environment are doing the selecting . '' http : //www.arn.org/docs/wells/jw_pepmoth.htm Another look into this is given at ... http : //www.talkdesign.org/faqs/moonshine.htm All that has been observed is that the population changed colour . They do n't even know why . Despite this , misleading statements such as ... `` The peppered moth ( Biston betularia ( L. ) ) is a temperate species of night-flying moth notable for its evolution of industrial melanism . '' http : //www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Peppered-moth are continually spread . ( http : //www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/Moths/moths.html ) Cited above argues quite well that we still do n't know why - all an evolutionist can say is 'it happened ' , and 'it happened by evolution ' . It is akin to Darwin giving examples of 'natural selection ' by referring to how man breeds animals . In other words , his evidences for natural selection comes from non-natural , purpose driven selection . Darwin said `` There is no reason why the principles which have acted so efficiently under domestication should not have acted under nature . In the survival of favoured individuals and races , during the constantly-recurrent Struggle for Existence , we see a powerful and ever-acting form of Selection . '' http : //www.tbi.univie.ac.at/Origin/origin_15.html The phrase 'survival of the fittest ' was not even Darwin 's . It was urged on him by Wallace , the codiscoverer of natural selection , who hated 'natural selection ' because he thought it implied that something was doing the selecting . Darwin coined the term 'natural selection ' because had made an analogy with 'artificial selection ' as done by breeders , an analogy Wallace had n't made when he developed his version of the theory . The phrase 'survival of the fittest ' was originally due to Herbert Spencer some years before the Origin http : //www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/tautology.html And this sort of thing continues today in modern textbooks . `` From time to time , attacks on neo-Darwinism are mounted , usually by persons who either see evolutionary theory as antireligious or who basically misunderstand Darwin 's theory . One attack , entitled `` Darwin 's Mistakes , '' by Tom Bethell , was published in Harper 's magazine . Bethell began by pointing out that Darwinian theory is a tautology rather than a predicative theory . ( The term tautology means a statement that is true by definition . ) * That is , evolution is the survival of the fittest . But who are the fittest ? Obviously , the individuals who survive . Thus , without an independent criterion for fitness , other than survival , we are left with the statement that evolution is the survival of the survivors . This indeed is a tautology . But it is possible to assign independent criteria for fitness . Darwin wrote extensively about artificial selection in pigeons , in which the breeders ' choice was the criterion for fitness . ( Many novel breeds of pigeon have been created this way . ) Artificial selection has been practiced extensively by plant and animal breeders . Here too , survival is not the criterion for fitness , productivity is . '' Robert H Tamarin , ( 1996 ) `` Principles of Genetics '' ( 5th ed ) , p571 .	disagree	notsarc

The abilty to reason comes from the abilty to ask the question , why . A hunter animal sees its prey running and runs after it , it doesnt ask itself why it runs , a grass eating animal eats grass , it doesnt ask why it grows . The first thing a human thinks is why , then tries to reason to find an answer . If you combine that with natural instincts , you get a creature that slowly evolves by using reason . Humans maybe stubborn , they insist there is an answer to everything , and when they cant find that answer using reason and logic , they resort to `` escapism '' and answer such questions in a way that hides there lack of understanding , by creating gods to explain the yet unexplainable . Thats maybe why we pray .	I think that while may be correct , it sounds too elitist to be accurate . Sane people do n't create imaginary friends to explain things . Most tribal religions are very matter of fact . While exotic or fantastic they are very material ( lots of talking animals ) , and also meant to be entertaining . They also incorporate superstitions , which often hold a few survival tips . Also `` primitive '' religions revolve around hallucinations , via shamanism and drug use .

If someone gives you an eye witness account of an event that happened before your time and all the evidence that you have collected does not contradict that account , is it no logical and rational to believe that eye witness ' account ?

So if the evidence that we have collected does not contradict what His eye witness account says ( i.e . Genesis ) than , is it not logical and rational to believe it to be true ?

It was paid for by Respect Life Ministry of the Oakland Diocese of the Roman Catholic Church . BART says that it had to accept the ads , since they 're a form of free speech under the First Amendment . But the campaign is seeing some vocal dissent from BART riders : `` Critics of the ads also seem to be taking matters into their own hands . Hundreds of the ads have been defaced with markers , had stickers placed over them or have been torn down and ripped up , according to Monika Rodman , coordinator of the group that placed the ads . `` 'The defacement has taken to religious epithets , profanity , everything you can think of , ' she said . A billboard at the MacArthur station in Oakland was torn to shreds , she said , and mini-essays were written on others . `` So many of the ads have been destroyed , she said , that a supply of a couple of dozen extras has been exhausted , and the ministry has ordered reinforcements from its printer .

In the first edition , Haeckel 's biogenetic law and the problems with it are discussed on page 153 in respectable fashion ( this corresponds with page 303 in the second edition ) -- and in fact the primary issue surrounding Haeckel in textbooks , which has always been to debunk Haeckel 's `` ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny '' oversimplification , is in fact admirably discussed in all three editions .	neutral	notsarc

Playing God 's advocate here . Most , but not all , religions assume that there 's a special relationship between God and man . Almost symbiotic , although that does n't quite catch all the subtleties . If evolution is true , then the universe was around for billions of years , as was the earth , before people showed up . If we are God 's special interest , then he probably would n't have waited around billions of years for us to evolve . If we `` just happened '' then most religion 's idea that God cares about us in some special way is thrown into serious doubt .	Actually it just took GOD a long time to work out the bugs in his ideas thats why humans only appeared very recently . We are special because he took his time to gain the skills and knowledge necessary to build his masterpieces - namely us . We are after all the crown of creation meant to dominate all the inferior life forms and to take whatever we wish from the planet . Are we not ?	disagree	sarc
The hypothesis of a mitochondria Eve is about 17 years old and has been shown to be wrong .	Really ? When and by whom ? I was n't even aware that it was an hypothesis but simply a mathematical concept derived from the mutation rate of the mitochondrial DNA . Possibly the time has been adjusted due to differing estimates of the mutatiion rate , but the concept is valid . Here is some information . Monty , I would recommend that you read the books suggested so that you might gain some understanding of what you are discussing . You continue to make yourself look foolish .

No , he is right . You 're thinking about evidence after it 's been interpreted rather than the raw data available to all - which is not to say that it is equally scrutinised by all . The difference is that the interpretation of those facts that supports common descent is based on axioms that have many times proved their worth as accurate and predictive . That 's the part Ken does n't seem to appreciate : although axioms are indeed stated rather than derived or proved , where they lead you , the expectations they engender , can be compared with reality in order to see whether your axioms are congruent with those upon which reality operates .	I think Ham is simply being disingenuous - he advances the idea that we all have the same evidence so that he can then go on to argue that indeed it 's a matter of interpretation and that it 's unfair to deny the bible as an interpretative tool , because he knows perfectly well that any fair-minded person will stop and consider the argument . But in practice , he and the people whose opinions he defends do not actually think like this . We do not have all the same evidence , because something that you and I and all other reasonable people will agree is evidence even though interpretations may diverge will be rejected as evidence ab initio . And that is my point - albeit probably expressed unclearly in my earlier post .	neutral	notsarc
Faith by definition is a belief without evidence .	yes . But then you throw in `` reasoned faith '' . But then you are making up terms that try to show faith as reason . What is reasoned faith ? If reasoned faith is the same as `` reason '' , then fine , you are n't using faith . If it 's faith , belief without evidence , then your evidence is your faith , and thus , it 's circular . If your faith is even part of your `` evidence '' or `` reason '' for belief , then logically the entire claim is arrived at through circular reasoning . You can use both all you like , I 'm just letting you know it 's fallacy to claim faith as evidence , which you do . If you do not , then you are using reason , and not faith , and we do n't need to continue because I see no fallacy in using evidence to back your claim . Enjoy .

What 's your point ? Of course they will be bound by Heller just as the courts are bound by Roe v. Wade . That point was n't in dispute .

So your mention of that case makes little sense if you are trying to make the point that Heller was not true to precedent . Heller was not about concealed carry , but rather the RKBA for self defense Of the 3 judges , only Dickensen interpreted the RKBA as did the dissents in Heller .

No one has the right to take a life for the sake of convenience ( I 'm not talking about aborting because the mother 's life is at stake , for now just clear-cut convenience ) .

Evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin said : we have a prior commitment to materialism .

Of course , in searching for the source of these quotes we find that they seem to be limited to creationist web sites . Nowhere can one find a correct attribution .

A key doctrine in my own faith is that Jesus was born of a virgin , even though it makes no scientific sense - there is the matter of Jesus 's Y-chromosome to account for . But that is the point . Miracles , by definition , do not have to make scientific sense . They are specific acts of God , designed in most cases to get a message across . Their very rarity is what makes them remarkable . An atheist , of course , will argue that miracles are bogus and are stitched together from the needs and desires of human imagination . Maybe so . To a believer , miracles are more than `` violations of the laws of nature , '' as they were described by David Hume . They reflect a greater reality , a spiritual reality , and they occur in a context that makes religious , not scientific , sense . To the nonbeliever , there is no spiritual reality , and hence there are no miracles . To a person of faith , miracles display the greater purposes of God , giving them a meaning that transcends physical reality . If this is true , why should n't we allow that the creation of our species was a miracle ? Or why not agree that the sudden explosion of life in the Cambrian era might have been a miracle ? Both might have been . In 1900 , we could easily have said that the sun 's fire was a miracle . Unable to explain the biological basis of immunity , we could have chalked that up to God , too . And for good measure we could have told our students that the interior heat of the earth might be the work of the devil . We are now far enough along in the development of science to appreciate that its track record suggests that ultimately it will find natural causes for natural phenomena .	But wait a minute ! Has n't science found that it 's scientifically impossible for Jesus to be born of a virgin - no Y-chromosome ? Why is he willing to forfeit science and accept the Bible in that regard , and forfeit the Bible in so many other respects ? Why is it okay for him to accept the virgin birth of Christ , and riducule anyone who believes in the creation of the first man , Adam ? If God could handle the Y-chromosome , could n't God also handle creating the first , fully formed man ? He calls Adam `` fictional '' on page 5 . It becomes more and more clear why atheists are comfortable with theistic evolution . If there was no Adam , there was no original sin , and no genealogy as described in the book of Genesis , only monkeys . Except for his amazing exception to science in the virgin birth of Jesus , he seems to allow evolutionistic pronouncements to have priority over Biblical statements . Then ALL the basics of Christianity , the nature of God and central New Testament teachings , including the way the sinner Adam ( one man ) and the Savior Jesus ( one man ) are linked together in Romans 5 , 16-18 , are trivialized just the way atheists love . No wonder they 're so comfortable with theistic evolution ! On the bottom of page 235 , Miller 's comment about `` just about any preacher I have had the patience to listen too ... .. '' speaks volumes - his cluelessness about original sin and many other things about Christianity shows he has n't had patience to listen to too many . But patience does n't seem to be a factor when it comes to his enthusiasm for Darwin 's works . He finishes the book with `` What kind of God do I believe in ? The answer is in these words . I believe in Darwin 's God . '' Sorry folks . It 's going to take more than a herd of angry atheists to convince me that he 's anything but a phony . I hope this thread gets some civilized responses .	neutral	sarc

Lurch , I do n't appreciate your condescending tone . If you want to challenge my assertion that you are a pompous XXX that jumps to conclusions , you will need to be a little less judgemental and start thinking outside of Darwin 's Black Box .	Well it was n't actually condescending but a challenge . Are you saying that you are n't up to it ? If you want I 'll start calling you names too . Is n't it funny how creationists begin that sort of thing when someone doubts their dogma ? As for thinking outside the box , I can guarantee that evolutionary biology requires more thinking and encountering of new and difficult ideas than creationism does . To study science no one begins by signing an agreement to believe only religious dogma or to reject any scientific fact that disagrees with the mythology of bronze age herdsmen . In fact , you make a name in science by challenging established dogma . Just think about the famous scientists . Besides , how can I speak to you on an equal level about science when you do n't seem to understand it very well . Anyone who demands proof has no idea what science is or how it works . Then shall we start with a discussion of the carina ? I was n't sure that you were familiar with the terms and it makes the discussion easier to use the correct terms . Without discussing these structures and comparing them to theropods and birds you really ca n't understand why it is so clearly a transitional . But if you do n't want the condescending tone , then you need to pay attention . Perhaps if I told you to follow with your finger as you read it would help . If you can call me a pompous XXX the it should be OK if I call you ignorant , is n't it ? Why else would you be asking me at the end of your post I claimed exactly the opposite of what I actually claimed . I 'll explain at the risk of hurting your feelings again . Herring gulls and Lesser black-backed gulls do not interbreed . They are reproductively isolated . They fit quite nicely into the definition you gave of an insipient species . So Herring gulls do n't reproduce with Lesser black-backed gulls but herring gulls can reproduce with American herring gulls to the west , which can reproduce with gulls to the west and so on until you get to the Lesser black-backed gull ( which do n't reproduce with Herring gulls ) They are classified as separate species even though they are at the extreme ends of a single population . They illustrate one way that species develop . There are other examples of ring species , the most famous being a salamander in California and a bird around the Tibetan plateau . So how about this ? Genetic studies were done of Brown bears from around the world . Their DNA was very similar and they seem all populations seem to be able to interbreed as far as we know . Except for the Brown bears of the ABC Islands Although they look like other Brown bears , the have distinctive differences in their DNA . It is closer to Polar bear DNA , even though the Polar looks quite different and has characteristics not found in Brown bears . But guess what . All these bears can interbreed , including Polar bears with Grizzly bears . OK . Your turn for a few insults . I have come to expect it from creationists .	disagree	sarc
You need to read what people say more thoroughly , and think about it before you respond . When he said `` can '' ( and there are not many simpler words than that ! ) It did n't mean `` will '' , `` must '' , or `` shall '' be more aggressive . It has been shown that in some cases it `` CAN '' happen . It may not have happened with you . It still might , we do n't know . We might even say that it is not likely to happen , but we ca n't say that it wo n't , because sometimes some people do behave more aggressively when they have a gun .	So now we should be making laws on the basis that it can happen ? Maybe we should start rethinking our laws regarding sex offenders since all men can commit rape and just might ; maybe we should arrest them now and force them to register as `` potential future sex offenders '' ? By your same logic of `` can happen '' we should revise our marriage laws to define marriage as being between two carbon based entities , because we might one day make contact with an alien species that 's silicon based . Just because something could take place , does n't mean that it might , or that it will . A pilot could go screwball and fly a 747 passenger plane into the Statue of Liberty tomorrow , are you proposing we institute new laws because something like that might happen ? How far do you want to take the preemptive strike thing ?

A few blocks from my house there is a group of stores with some offices on the second floors . Apparently there is a Planned Parenthood office in the complex because a group of anti-abortion protestors were there the other day . I didnt know that before then . I wondered what they hoped to accomplish by their protest so I asked them . One woman said she hoped to discourage women from considering abortion . I didnt think of it at the time , but Planned Parenthood does a lot more than abortion services . I wonder if the protests might also dissuade a young woman who was seeking contraceptive services from going into that office as well . If this were the case , the abortion protests would accomplish the opposite of their goal . They potentially could have increased the chances of an unwanted pregnancy by discouraging contraceptive use . In turn , this might increase the chances of an abortion .

Not so . Systems are extended , temporally . They are a series of connected , interdependent events , and not a singlular event , by definition . Therefore there is no saying that what determines them is a single set of 'initial conditions ' , since even the simplest allopatric systems [ such as the solar system ] , are constantly and perpetually receiving fresh input on top of whatever their 'initial conditions ' may have been . Initial conditions start systems going , but they continue on thanks to constant input ; otherwise entropy puts a stop to them . Therefore it is false to believe that `` if you could trace the evolution of [ any ] system back in time with perfect accuracy , [ then what it is now ] would all be originally determined by the system 's initial state . `` .	But of course ! Of course you have to take into account all the input that any one system receives from all external sources in order to trace back to an initial state . ( No system can ever be truly closed , truly isolated from the rest of the universe , for what should be obvious reasons . Certain systems are only classified as 'closed ' for experiments ' sake because they have been very efficiently isolated and the parameters of unavoidable input are precisely calculable and can be subtracted from results , thereby giving the results that a truly closed system would provide . ) In your pool-shot example below , for instance , the initial state must take account of the wear & amp ; tear of the table , the strength of the cue , the slope of the floor , humidity , temperature and every other variable . So any such 'backtracking ' ( which is highly hypothetical given the extreme complexity of the calculations ) has to take into account the knowledge that no system is isolated . This is part of what chaos theory attempts to do , and why chaos theory must deal in probabilities until we have computers ordres of magnitude more powerful than we do today .	neutral	notsarc

Where do they find the retards that dream this stuff up ? First of all , handguns are nearly impossible to obtain legally in Canada as it is , 95 % + of handguns used in crimes in Canada have been illegally smuggled into the country from the USA . Even the police forces are saying that the law is pointless as it would only serve to increase the smuggling of handguns from the US , and would likely not have any impact on the rate of handgun use in crimes .
