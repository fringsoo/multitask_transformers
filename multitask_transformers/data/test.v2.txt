apparently, these "underlying preferences" are of absolutely no effect, since the psychological conditioning  of the individual overrides any other "built-in" trait factor. therefore these "built-in" trait factors are useless in practicality, because nothing about the individual's identity is influenced by them. so why should we even entertain the idea that they exist?

The militia of the Second Amendment is a militia that is described as being well regulated (regulated by both the federal government and the states as spoken of in Article 1 of the Constitution). In our own day, I think the National Guard would be the only militia that qualifies as being well regulated. Alexander Hamilton spoke of the desirability of the militia being well regulated:"It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects, whenever they were called into service for the public defense. It would enable them to discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army; and it would fit them much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be essential to their usefulness. This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority. It is, therefore, with the most evident propriety, that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the Union "to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, RESERVING TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS, AND THE AUTHORITY OF TRAINING THE MILITIA ACCORDING TO THE DISCIPLINE PRESCRIBED BY CONGRESS."The Federalist Papers - THOMAS (Library of Congress)We could go back to the days when most citizens were required to enroll in the militia, have guns and get military training- to what the Founders really meant when they spoke of a well regulated militia being the security of a free state. But the Supreme Court along with pro-gun activists claiming to be pro- Second Amendment have decided to turn their back on that part of the Second Amendment while giving the lip service to the idea of a militia.	Well regulated as in the second amendment does not mean regulated by the government, it means well equiped and prepared. The framers of the constitution often spoke of a tyrannical government and how to keep one from coming to power, so why in the hell would they have said lets just give the government total control of guns. Your definition of well regulated makes about as much sense as adding another day to the week.	notsarc

the only stupid gun laws are the laws that arent strict enoughlike the law that gun nuts wanted that would allow children to tote around assault rifleshow stupid can you be	What laws are these that you speak of? Kindly provide the bill name and number so you have some actual proof and aren't simply parroting from the fear-mongering Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center.During World War II the American people rounded up Japanese-Americans and herded them into concentration camps because you were at war with the people of Japan and thought that they were the sleeping enemy even though they had no proof. What you're speaking of is no different than this.The way I see it Brady, your hatred for guns and gun owners is so overwhelming and logic defying, that you'd be perfectly alright with unleashing a life-ending pandemic plague on the people of earth if you believed it would put an end to all gun owners everywhere.	notsarc

it is hard to believe that it won't draw attention away from everyone else. but everyone will get it and it will draw attention away from the families that are there supporting their kids...and the fact still remains that your goal is to influence (or show) the administration when it should be to give your child a good time.  when your purpose is to draw attention it is hard to imagine that it wouldn't take it away from the main purpose. think of it this way...you have 1 camera at the event...you hear about this 't-shirt' thing and all of a sudden the camera is not focusing on the kid tripping over himself to roll the egg but to gay parents wearing these t-shirts and them talking about how they are great parents. my question is...if you are such great parents why aren't you with your kid instead of talking to the tv camera about your personal message? i don't buy it anymore than if someone got a big group together and had t-shirts that said 'i chose life for my child!'.	Ahh but what if all the shirts have only american flags on them. Would it them be a group of patiotic americans and their children?

No it f****n' isn't! If that was the case then Plessy v. Ferguson should have been used as precedent for all the following cases that dealt with segregation and racism.

Okay, here is how it went: God made the animals. He said,"Hey, Adam needs a helper." He brought the animals to Adam to name. He couldn't find a helper for Adam. He then took a rib out of Adam's side to create Eve. This was done on the sixth day. God created them both on the sixth day, Adam first, then Eve out of Adam's side after he had Adam name the animals.	That interpretation is fine except that God says, "I WILL make a helper suitable for him." He hadn't made the animals yet in verse 18, but he created Adam in verse 7.	notsarc

The left supports rights while your side want to limit the rights of others.You want to stop me from being able to marry because you have a religious belief against it even though I may have a religious belief that supports it. Therefore you are imposing your religious and moral views on me when I do not share those beliefs.	notsarc

are a subset of criminals (ie not all criminals are burglars or muggers). Ripskar pointed out that gangs (criminals, but not necessarily burglars or muggers) tend to have guns.

So they (pro-life peeps) say abortion is murder. Of course, you can only murder people. So their rule is that fetuses (feti?) are people also.

Even if the number of defensive uses is only 800,000 a year, that's still a rate of more than 53 to 1 when compared to the number of homicides committed with a firearm.Kleck was a supporter of the anti-gun position.

So with that, it's also pretty easy to imagine that there was no NEED for the human genome to mutate to accommodate a fruitless/vitaminC-less diet. Likewise, we also know that primates also consume a diet high in fruits, leaves and berries, thereby getting plenty of vitamin C. So like humans, primates would have no reason for their genomes to mutate if they ate fruits and leaves high in vitamin C from the beginning.	Well yes, but thats not what DEFECTIVE GULO indicates. If one has external sources of vitamin C, GULO can mutate to be inactive without causing a problem, and once inactive the inactive gene can be inherited without causing problems so long as vitamin C intake is high enough. An inactive GULO indicates that the species has external sources of vitamin C which is essential to many metabolic processes.	notsarc

all of the british papers keep going on about how bad it is, how more people than ever are being gunned down in the streets, how guns are being imported into britain and resold through underground channels, how criminals employ young women to act as gun mules for transporting and storage, etc. now who should we believe more, your or the papers that relate the news to us?	Is that a trick question? No, the tabloid and other gutter press keep going on about how bad it is, because they sell papers by fanning fear and hatred, and fear of crime is one of their biggest markets. Yes there has been an increase in gun crime over the years, but that's largely attributable to increased attractiveness of crime in a society where social mobility has come to a standstill. In any case the number of incidents where firearms are used in crime is still very small, which is why every time someone gets shot it is headline news.   Guns are incredibly rare in this country, the only time I've seen guns in real life (other than air rifles) is on a military base.	notsarc

legislative solutions and popular appeal are not the same thing. the legislature is hired to do what's right, not what's popular. that aside, where has the gay rights movement used voting as anything except a measure of last resort? if gays knew they could count on popular support they wouldn't need to fight to get their rights protected. we know this. we also know that's there's lots of big money opposing gay rights, and sadly enough money is often the deciding factor in voting. so where is voting being used as anything other than a last ditch attempt to accomplish something for the gay rights movement?	well, you ignored the part where i said 'voting'. but imo legislative solutions are part and parcel to popular appeal because legislators are voted in on that basis. any legislator claims to 'do what's right.' so elections tend to be popularity contests. and legislators tend to want to keep their constituents happy. oh and just to make sure you understand this kronos so as not to get off in the wrong direction, this is my opinion, just like everything else i've said. it is not a lie. how is that even relevant? i never claimed it was a first resort.	notsarc

did you watch the video? this is not about liberals vs. conservatives. the argument is that a childs success is not by any means proportional to the sexual orientation of its parents. mr. wahls is an example of that. good parenting and luck is what's needed to instigate success in a child. you seem to insinuate that is done only by 'liberals' (man, i hate that term). this is simply rhetorical analysis 101. pathos to be exact. you appeal to a persons emotions. it's a marketing ploy used by advertisers and politicians and is not particular to the left. i assume you're describing the up your alley sections of that website which is hardly representative of the entire homosexual community.	so?? it was still a speech made for the purpose of political support of gay marriage. yes, i watched it. agreed. it was for the purpose of appealing to emotion (to a political end). no, but my point is that neither does the sanitized 'norman rockwell' image that some gay-pride proponents want projected by linking to videos such as the one here. it might give the impression that gay pride is merely some 'family-friendly' movement without the reality of the very dark side to it.	notsarc

Well, I define illness based upon the way medical professionals define illness, in which case, homosexuality is NOT an illness, and pedophilia is.Upon what criteria do you define illness?Upon what criteria do you judge them as wrong?	I think pedophilia is a disorder as opposed to an illness but I'd have to look back at some psychology books. How do I define illness? Well, I have a few contexts for this. The flu...obvious illness. Christians feel that sin is an "illness", so in that sense we are all rather ill :). As for wrong...same deal.	sarc
Ok according to the bible God only created the first two beings, Adam and Eve. Now christians dont rule out science, and science has shown that we produce offspring. God has created these offspring but not directly. Think of photosynthesis, we eat meat, this is getting energy from the sun indirectly. So we have shown that we ourselves produce offspring but we are put here and given the abbility by God to produce offspring. As far as your question on why God alows addicts to have babies it can be explained as this. We where given the freedome of choice to decide if we want to be an addict, wrong put we have the choice. God created us to have that choice, or else we would be robots. The bible also says God knows everything yet to come, so he new that this particular person would become an addict and have baby. God can stop this put he doesnt interecpt dirrectly with our choices.	So God already knows if a particular person will become an addict? That doesn't leave much free choice for that person, does it? If I go to a restaurant and God already knows I'm going to choose the poached salmon for my entree, then I don't have much choice in the matter, do I? Omniscience and free will are mutually exclusive. If God is omniscient, then we are indeed ultimately robots. Deluded with the perception of free will, but robots none the less.Unless of course, God is so omnipotent that he can know everything and still allow free choice. But then reason, logic, and thought become delusional. Sounds like a loose / loose situation to me.	notsarc

No it is not. Darwinists say that evolution happens by way of selection of random variants.....what I'm asking for is for science to make sure the variants don't arise nonrandomly. I'm looking for experiments on animals that rule out heritable, adaptive variation.	Again, nonrandom is not the same as Lamarckian. Phenotypic variation can be nonrandom because the organisms can select the most attractive/successful mates with whom to breed. Once again, you're totally stuck on one aspect of the ToE, random mutation; the ToE is much more than that.	notsarc

Since posts are disappearing anyway, let me add a new one.Now we all know that I am made in the image and likeness of God and since God is perfect, that image and likeness must also be, as a logical consequence, perfect.

As for who plays 'word-games', it seems that you missed this... #19 "New peppered moth stuff"He went on for some time trying to undermine my posts based on the use of a word which most people have a problem with.There's also the problem with Darwin claiming a tautology was a better term than "Natural Selection", this was debated for some time, even though I posted the actual words of Darwin.The thread "Unto the Ages of Ages" developed into a debate over whether something could be both ''more accurate' and wrong, thanks Ursus!WJA and SLP argued over the word 'applied', then 'published'; whether Dembski had, and then changed this to 'proved' (see "Looking for intelligence" thread)Lurch/Ungerdunn etc over what is a 'noun'. Multiple personalities aside, this debate over 'nouns' lasted for months. He resorted to no better argument then 'you're wrong'. A great debating style!As for debating styles....Waxy enters a debate on Science/Math says that I've been refuted somewhere else, by someone else, and then leaves; does the same thing on these Creation/Evolution debates... only adds a few insults in the process... not wishing to debate, just to name call.Mach is happy to admit he doesn't read my posts/skims over them but wants to both debate and not debate them - claiming he's got a time problem... and asks me to post stuff he's already replied toWould you count as a word-game the two incidents where you've made a claim about me being insulting, and when I've asked you to point it out, you can't?One time you were so flustered you told me you were going to warn everyone about me. You make allegations then don't back them up.Archilochus makes allegations that I don't understand the word 'chance' but is un-prepared to come up with a definition, just repeats that I don't understand it. He'll go on repeating this, because it is a replacement for debate.All the while you guys are very shy when it comes to debating each other's mistakes; such as Hank describing the world as egg-shaped, etc.In short you make so many 'just-so' statements with little recourse to evidence, in an effort to drown out anyone who differs in opinion from yourself.

That is what has upset a number of people; when this has been pointed out. This is also why many pro-evolutionists are so quick to resort to ad hominem here. That's what this thread of yours is an attempt at - and at best it is something that suggests only other people are guilty of this crime.	No, I for one dislike your posts because I know you intentionally write irrational posts to help support your religious cause.   Just for the record montalban, basically every single legitimate scientist is "pro-evolution". Creation theory is not taught in public schools, not by chance, but because...*gasp* it's RELIGIOUS MUMBO JUMBO. There is no evidence to support it. Creation fiction has made no progress with it's "faith-based" (lackofevidence) with rational people.   And I'll also say that I'd welcome ad hominem over irrational thinking any day. Ad hominem is just a lack of patience, or someone who doesn't care to hide their emotion or opinion. Irrational thinking on the other hand is often only cured by death. Someone guilty of ad hominem can still hold a rational debate. The irrational..well, why bother?   -Mach	sarc

You should really think about what you say before you say it. I have heard this before and its garbish, I have been around and owned guns my whole life and I have never, not even once, had the thought of getting a gun just because someone ###### me off. I would never use a gun on a person unless that person were a viable threat to my life, such as coming at me with a knife for example.	You need to read what people say more thoroughly, and think about it before you respond. When he said "can" (and there are not many simpler words than that!) It didn't mean "will", "must", or "shall" be more aggressive. It has been shown that in some cases it "CAN" happen. It may not have happened with you. It still might, we don't know.

If everyone in the world was gay, the human race would become extinct.Edit/Delete Message Reply With Quote	So gay people, in your opinion, have no right to form the families of their choice? So you are defending the continued oppression of gay people?We are sick of conservative family types. We are tired of the closet. The phrase "we are mad as hell and we are not going to take it any more" applies. I see in your response the comming of the camps to lock and exterminate gay people. It is that type of thought, that jews were subhuman, that led to the final solution. As it is here with conservatives and religious right nuts, who believe gay people are sub human sickos in need of curing or killing.	notsarc

The author is arguing that gun control in rural areas does not constitute crime control in urban areas but somehow you try to spin that into making it sound as if the author is making some blanket statement against all gun control.	So what if the author isn't arguing against gun control? At last, there is indication that England has taken a step in the right direction and realized that taking all guns away from everybody isn't the answer to crime.	notsarc
Since evolution can't prove the book of Genesis (ancient history) false, and creationism does have some historical backing, they are comparable and they directly conflict.	Only those ignorant of science and evolution think that "evolution" has anything to do with the Bible. I guess that's because creationism is an attempt to pretend that mythology is somehow scientific and makes silly statements about science. It seems that science is somehow anti-Bible in that case when science debunks ignorance.	sarc
i love tattoos, i've got three so far, a dragon that takes up my right calf, a tribal design on my back and darwin's tree of life on the inside of my left forearm modified to include family initials at branch points with the 'i think' wording on top at my wrist, i also had it thickened up to make it look less like a squiggly hand sketch. the left arm tat is only the start of a sleeve which i plan to cover the entire left arm leading to a merger with the black tribal on my back. i also have plans with my tattooist to put black cat from spiderman as drawn by j scott campbell in there somewhere and to get my family's names and the mantra 'natura non facit saltum in elvish along both of my outer forearms.	wow :) i'm just a starter, that's my first big tattoo (the debate picture, sorry about the glare, i had another sitting friday and it was lathered in tattoo goo!) i've had 5 hours on it so far, still got so long left but it's going to be a 3/4 sleeve once finished.	notsarc

I think he examined her record and the information by which some other doctor pronounced her PVS, noting that one or more criteria for establishment of that diagnosis was missing. I'm not arguing the case for him, I'm just saying she should be fed until this is proved wrong. The doctor is supposed to be quite an eminent member of his filed of study and may actually know what he is talking about.	Examined the record? Now it's not even the patient, just the record? Good god man! Many times, only a number of criteria must be met, not all of them. It would be like me saying that there must be gas in your car since it is running. Then you tell me that I must look at the gauge then physically take the tank off to be able to say without a doubt there is gas in it. Flat EEG in the cerebral cortex means no brain activity in cerebral cortex means PVS. There is no reason to test a swallowing reflex, a pain response reflex, or sphincter tone.	sarc

Personally i don't believe in abortion. It's morally wrong and i think it's good that it's illegal.	I think often abortion is wrong but I do not agree with criminalizing it. Primarily the reasons that are used to justify criminilzation are hugely fallacious and secondarily because it won't do a thing that is positive. A woman who is determined to end her pregancy - will. Criminalization will simply make it extremely dangerous. I am responsible, have even had my tubes tied, but if I were to become pregnant and that pregnancy were the result of rape or a threat to my health or livlihood I would end it - and I will not be checking the law books first. Every woman has her line in the sand - abortion will go on regardless of its legal standing. There are a miriad of reasons seek abortion - comdemning those reasons does nothing (i.e. calling them selfish) - addressing them could help. The reasons are valid.	notsarc

the moral of that last story is: don't screw with baldy. that aside, where did god tell these folks to do what they did? just curious.	morals are what you make them to be. for example, 'it's ok to kill youths if they've insulted your prophets' is another possible one. the ones in my joshua example? he doesn't tell them, nor did i say that he told them. look at what i said: 'the morality of the old testament peoples (god included) is definitely questionable.'. however, in the next chapter he does immediately reward them, by protecting them from the angry reprisals of the neighbouring villages: '5 then they set out, and the terror of god fell upon the towns all around them so that no one pursued them.' note that in the other examples, god is either commanding it (through the proxy of a speaker) or directly doing it (pillar of salt, bears etc).	notsarc
there is another forum for this discussion. but, if you accept that it is not a scientific theory, why should it be taught in a science class?	take it up with who brought it up. who said the idea of it being 'scientific' is the criteria for a theory to be taught in schools?  schools have to have some degree of autonomy to have the curriculum they want without over-regulation. who sets the standard of what's 'scientific' or not?	notsarc

interesting that those three are also the weakest and rarest of arguments when arguing for gun control. in fact, i have never witnessed anyone basing their entire gun control argument on the fact that 'gun owners lack the testicular fortitude to fight someone in hand-to-hand combat.'	Actually, I find it near impossible to discuss the second amendment without gun control advocates bringing up the third argument. Weak? Yes. Rare? No.      In my opinion, all arguments in favor of gun control are weak.	notsarc
So if same-sex relationships are legally recognized as "marriage," the idea of marriage as a sexually exclusive and faithful relationship will be dealt a serious XXXX.

Again, I don't think anybody will argue that owning a gun prevents crime. The reason for having a gun is as you stated - to stop the crime once it has begun (though this may prevent a worse crime from occurring).	I think some people will and have argued that. I'll work on finding a quote, but I believe it was somebody here who argued that, because of the recent SCotUS ruling, home invasion in DC would decrease because criminals would be more worried about encountering a homeowner with a gun. You do have a point about preventing a worse crime from occuring,though.	notsarc
cute, but not quite. the claim is that we want everybody to have guns. so i'd like to see some proof that gun owners have called for the repealing of the federal age limit that covers the purchase of firearms, and for the prohibited persons list that keeps felons, the insane, the drug addicted, and those that beat their wives, from legally buying guns. if those of my chosen party have made the claims that we want criminals, terrorists and the others in these categories to have guns, then i'd like to see them. otherwise the claim that we want everybody armed is nothing more than a lie. the private property of whom? we have security stops along the mexican/american border to search for drugs and other contraband. how is it not possible on the way to and from dc?	simple answer? dc has a lot less budget than the usa government. more complex answer? just looking at the commuters, there are over 400,000 people that come to work in dc every day (see link in my last post). making the preposterous assumption that they all come in at a constant flow, just looking at 400,000 of them and assuming that you would only check them coming in, that's ~4.6 people admitted per second for every second of the working week. good luck with that. good luck with convincing people that it's constitutional, as well - airports get away with it, but only because there is such a (largely unfounded) fear of death by terrorist that they can get away with something which is constitutionally shady. a quick search gave me two relevant results almost immediately.	notsarc
with regards to the cousins argument if a creature evolves into a new species wouldn't the old species not exist any more?	No, say you've got 200 of some species. By some event, 100 member are seperated. Now we have two groups of 100. Each group goes through different selections and they accumulate small changes. Eventually, they will be different enough so that they are no longer able to interbreed. That doesn't mean one group automatically has to die so we remain at the same number of species.Of course, one group might get some significant advantage which allows it to come back and ownzor the original area so the other group gets wiped out.	notsarc
the risk of homicide in the home is three times greater in households with guns.[3] the risk of suicide is five times greater in households with guns.[4] what's more, tragic stories of accidental or unintentional shootings from the careless storage of guns at home are all too common. the statistic noted above bears repeating: a gun in the home is 22 times more likely to be used in a criminal, unintentional, or suicide-related shooting than to be used in a self-defense shooting.

this doesnt really add up to anything more than your musings so i will take up one point. respect for your mother and father is only relevant in a society where the nuclear family is the norm. there have been some societies where this was not the norm. im afraid to say this demonstrates another example of someone that believes the world is and always was as he lives it . respect( or fear) is necessary for a functioning society but not necessarily towards parents..which is exactly what the commandment orders.	sorry your mightiness, thank you for your graciousness of addressing us common folk.  are you really that obtuse? i swear you and easy share a brain. i clearly pointed out that this commandment talks about respect for authority. personally, i think this applies to single parents, families with 2 daddies, or children raised in an orphanage.  yet i bet somehow in the formative years of the children, they are taught some form of respect for authority.  how so? i didn't write it, i'm just commenting on it. and again, i prefer to replace 'mother and father' with authority. regardless, who says respect = fear? maybe you and easy really do share a brain...you both seem to think you can define words as you see fit to lend creedence to your arguments.	sarc

It's just a term for someone who has decided to live in a way that isn't gay. They may be "gay" physiologically (whatever that means in terms of biology), but they are living in a way that doesn't give in to that--which is what matters from their religious standpoint. Many people live against urges (regarding various issues) all the time. Ironically, gay pride has itself largely to blame for the 'ex-gay' movement. I think it's an example of some gays swinging back against the 'out-and-proud' far left shift--religious gays are, in effect, saying they don't have to abide by your prescription for their lives.	And you're mentally disturbed. Didn't I say that there is no such thing as a "ex-gay"??? Did I stutter?You can pretend that denial is a river over in Egypt.

in re: the jefferson claim... it's true that he proposed castration for 'buggery.' but... considering that colonial scientists were as ignorant of sexual orientation as the ancient israelites, it's not surprising they drafted such a draconian punishment for homosexuality. jefferson's suggestion, however, was merciful by comparison. and we also know that, having revised the bible by editing out all the supernatural events (including, especially, the resurrection) and having referred to paul (author of the nt's allegedly anti-homosexual 'clobber' passages) as 'the great coryphaeus... the first corruptor of the doctrines of jesus,' that he would likely have been repelled by with archangel's views, on both god and homosexuality. in fact, it's probable, given his devotion to science and reason, that had he known then what our doctors and scientists know now about human sexuality he likely would not have gone so far as condoning so harsh an alternative as castration.	exactly who are you saying has revised the bible? and with that question asked, i believe by admitting that if it was revised to delete the meat of it, it would be equally diluted in power, content and strength.  really? if you're speaking about jefferson still, then why didn't he recommend that all punishments for homosexuality be erased from the law completely, and homosexuality be legalized at that time? that would have been the just and magnanimous thing to do if he believed such tripe as you attribute to him.	notsarc
but by that definition, either one could be viewed as impeding on religious freedom, including your view impeding on hers! we don't define imposing on religious freedom on the basis of having different ideals. it doesn't effect your religion or religious freedom if you don't get benefits under gay marriages. you can argue in other ways, on other basis, but the idea that not giving gays marriage benefits is imposing on religious freedom is an empty 'argument'.	but you have not shown how she would be harmed by equal marriage? i have shown that her definition infringes upon my religious freedom. if gay marriage becomes a reality then in no way does it infringe upon her in any way. would you care to explain how gay marriage infringes upon her in any way? it is her heterosexual privledge and her sence of entitlement that she is protecting not marriage.	notsarc

Is even 'channel' sufficiently ateleological a verb?	Yes. It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action. That is why 'selection' is always teleological. In order to select or choose anything, an end must always be in view. There must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end. The only time "channel" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. In the same way, 'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone. But 'selection' always requires volition and awareness. So 'selection' is always teleological.	notsarc

about as much 'soverienty' legitimation as hitler had when he was butchering the jews. no cause? you forget about trying to murder bush #41. no cause? you forget about him funding palestinian terrorists at $25k a pop. no cause? you forget about invading kuwait. no cause? he kicked out the u.n. inspectors. no cause? he fired at our airplanes who patrolled the no-fly zones. no cause? the mass graves and stalinist government? and these are just the things we know for certain.	that wasn't a reason why we fought hitler. in fact, if you will remember many in the states didn't believe that occured until they saw the pictures.  hardly a reason to invade. unless you'd like to flip it around and say that every country who's leader we tried to murder has the same right. emoticonxrolleyes  how is that our problem? oh yes, it's not.  as i recall, we kicked him out, beat him up, put him under sanctions and virtually removed any ability to do anything of revelance.  doesn't that mean we have to invade north korea? emoticonxrolleyes  that's been dealt with already. rehashed arguments are worthless.  huh. stalinist govermemnt. reminds me of the dictators the us put in power in latin america. :) the mass graves also was dealt with. but then again, you clearly do not understand the me culture.	sarc
Icons of Evolution: Science or Myth? Why Much of What We Teach About Evolution is Wrongby Jonathan WellsI appologise for not remembering the exact title, but its definately a good read.	I'm not familiar with the book, so can't comment upon it first hand. However http://www.ncseweb.org/icons/ appears to have a detailed critique of the book and may be of interest to you too.

Cold, again, is just an adjective.

One other point: Say that the laws of physics (which are derived from mutual human experience) are wrong but just appear to be right and that some omnipotent being can change them whenever he likes. If these apparent laws have remained the same for all of recorded human time, then why should we suspect that they may change at any moment? It all comes down to probability - if things are not what we expect they are from Science, then that should have manifested itself by now.	I'm not claiming any omnipotent deciever. I'm not sure where you derive 'probability' from, or how you can have any degree of certainty over your past experiences or those of other consciousnesses.And in any case, saying 'it hasn't happened yet' is hardly logical proof.	notsarc

it's marketing 101. in order to sell something, you have to convince people that they need it. in order to sell religion they convince people that they need it by telling them they are going to hell if they don't buy into their religion. the more things you declare a sin, the more people will be 'guilty' of those things, thereby increasing your customer base.	i love how you broke that down, but why would anyone who feels content in their life, by into something that's telling them they are wrong? it seems like they are cutting out a big portion of their market with a certain sin that harms no one.	notsarc

Hi Lisa - I disagree with you. Babies can't be helped while trivializing and restricting mothers and not recognizing their needs. There are reasons women choose to abort and those need to be addressed and there will also be cases where women need to abort (health concerns, rape, etc.).

because i said so! lol,... i'm so silly. i just had to post it.  seriously, i decided that i will actually construct my summary online, iangb. if you (or anyone else) cares to, you will be able to watch as i edit and construct my argument. it may be lengthy so keep it in mind that if i have to divide it up, and you post in the interim, i will have to delete this first half and move it to the end. by the way,... other than working some things out in my head,... i don't have anything prepared to post. this will be a work in progress. ... this will take quite a while. (maybe days) i see you are watching, and don't want you thinking this will be developing quickly. i will let you know when i've concluded. --chuz *** note to ian. in my attempt to compile my 'summary' i have realized that i never actually completed my arguments. it's kind of hard to summarize that which hasn't already been presented. so, my sumarization if you will- will now consists of two parts. first my arguments and then my summary.  work in progress; the argument biologically speaking, a human individual's life begins at conception definitions; a begin being biologically child conception egg embryo fetus  gamete  human individual life metamorphosisorganism sperm zygote-dictionary.com a begin being biologically child conception egg embryo fetus gamete human individual life metamorphosis organism sperm zygote-- free dictionary.com child  due process clause person --findlaw.com links logic a distinct human organism american college of pediatricians the human organism when does a human individual's life begin the physiology of aging human growth and aging wikipedia; life when does life begin? quotes; sperm; 'during fertilization, the nucleus of a sperm fuses with the nucleus of the much larger egg cell (the female reproductive cell) to form a new organism'.-the american heritage® science dictionary barack hussein obama; 'we need fathers to recognize their responsibility doesn’t just end at conception.' william jefferson clinton- 'if two cells join in the process that begins to make a human being, are they living? answer? no one disputes that. ' and 'when does the soul enter the body so that to terminate the living organism amounts to killing a person? that is the question.'	Chuz, the purpose of this summary is not to summarise your arguments as a whole - it is to summarise what your argument is up to this point.   Why not post just a summary of your position so far, as you see it - I can do the same, then you can continue with your argument?   There's no point in writing an argument, summarising it and then leaving the thread before I've had a chance to respond to even your argument (never mind your summary). If you are going to simply ignore any criticisms of your reasoning, then I struggle to see the point of you repeatedly requesting a one-on-one debate in the first place - you essentially regress your argument to the 'because I said so' that you are (presumably) hoping to avoid, it's just that there's slightly more detail.	notsarc

Anti-abortion legislation is simply a tool by which they try to maintain a less sexually permissive society, believing that if women who fall pregnant outside of marriage are forced to endure pregnancy and likely child-raising alone, rather than being offered an easy way out, they will be less likely to have sex outside of marriage.	I think you fail to take into account that for most opposers of abortion, they genuinely feel they are trying to save lives by their opposition. In many cases it's not a matter of trying control sexual prermissiveness in society but preventing lives from being killed. Disagree or not, you can't separate the anti-abortion message from the fact that it holds to the view that abortion is a form of murder.	notsarc

I have to watch for snares now? :)I didn't say it, nor does the Bible, that only males of the human race have souls.	Well, assuming that when the Bible says "you" in passages that are telling "you" to do something with your soul, I would hope that it also applies to women. But it never comes out and says "women and men have souls." This doesn't mean they don't have them.Same thing with animals. The book isn't written for non-humans, so when it says "you" we can assume it doesn't refer to non-humans. But the book never says "animals don't have souls."So we can't assume that they don't (according to the bible).	notsarc
i think a better question is what preserved their life for so long? it is the mercy of god that upholds and preserves people in this life. it is the sin of human beings that is responsible for death. this is not correct. god does go 'out of his way' to keep everyone alive. besides that, god would never be presented with any kind of problem, much less a problem of overpopulation. good grief, to suggest that the god who created the earth would have a problem with overpoulation is, frankly, as ridiculous as trying to find some passage in the bible that condones, allows, or supports any and every abortion that occurs. that is ridiculous.	ok, i understand now. all those people, including children and the fetuses of pregnant women were all sinful and god had to murder them in tsunamis, earthquakes, etc.,  is that how god deals with overpopulation? i guess that wars are part of god's plan, too, because the recent invasion of iraq wiped out more than 100,000 iraqis according to god's plan for dealing with overpopulation.	sarc

I agree, but when you know your opponent will succeed in making you look weak if you give them the chance, trying to look like the bigger man will do Jack for you.

On an internet forum why is that so important? The bigger man usually need not find it necessary to prove he is, but is secure in his knowledge he is or is big enough to realize when he isn't and adjust accordingly.My guess is this is not the only place this happens.

Ironically, when I have publicaly advanced the idea that God is generally compatable with evolution, I find that my agnostic and atheistic colleagues are generally comfortable with such ideas, but many believers are dumbfounded.	I believe that's true, and as a "believer" (creationist), here is what is hard to understand about that; In Matthew, 12:30, Jesus says "He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters". It is safe to say that both creationists and theistic evolutionists would accept that statement from Jesus, and would seek to be "with" him, while agnostic and atheists would consider themselves "not with" him. Yet theistic evolutionists are comfortable to (usually politically) be "with" agnostics and atheists, and separate themselves from creationists. If they're genuine Christians, knowing about the warnings in the Bible about false teachings, how can they be comfortable with that?Miller laments in several places throughout the book that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion, and that it shouldn't be that way - that it causes more strife between the two than should exist.	notsarc

the people's interest trumps your right to privacy when a warrant is issued. a nics check addresses the 'with no knowledge' part of your scenario. this is what i support. ca law already.	that's a real laugh, coming from someone with so little knowledge of the legal and justice systems as you. do you even know what goes into obtaining a search warrant? do you know what the limitations are regarding the scope of a search warrant and how it has to be narrowly tailored to something specific and nothing else? right. and it was ca law that lead to a father's children being murdered because he thought he was obligated to keep his guns locked up at all time, making them inaccessible even in a true life or death emergency. it was also california law that proved just how registration can, does and will, lead to confiscation. they proved our case for us and showed everyone that we weren't paranoid, and instead knew exactly what we were talking about.	notsarc
Look at the fossil record. They say each level of earth represents millions of years....and these millions of years were necessary because it took animals that long to change via RM + NS -- and indeed it might.

No, you lose. You lose any respect as someone who has an iota of common sense and decency as an American. He was under attack because he had invaded Kuwait and we were in the process of throwing him out of Kuwait. There was no justification to be firing scuds at innocent Israelis who were not a part of that war. You don't have a clue; not a single clue about Saddam. You just parrot the typical left-wing crapola. And it's doubly sickening coming from an American.	Again he was under attack. Listen to yourself. And talk about a parrot?

nope, you've still missed the point. bolding your repetition won't help, either. you said 'all visiting moslems'. not 'all visiting individuals'. specifically investigating 'all visiting moslems' is discriminatory. investigating 'all visiting individuals' is not - well, it is a bit, but less so - and you would not have got this response if you had suggested as such.	since we're at war with radical islam and they have attacked our homeland once already and have promised a repeat performance. it is ludicrous, irresponsible and suicidal to consider that investigating people of islamic descent before allowing them entry to be a discriminatory policy. especially since terrorists don't fight like men but are committed only to hit and die/run sneak attacks. but i'm not surprised that you're blinded by political correctness when you should be concerned about your families security. emoticonxrolleyes	sarc

"Modern" Atheists have only been around for a short time. In biblical times, Atheists were people who beleved in God(s), but didn't believe He/they intervened with life on Earth. How and why do you think the terms have changed, and what are the similarities between tham?	In older times man had more questions without answers than today. Some men believed if a God of fire because they did not understand what fire was. Because of their misunderstanding they invented an answer, the Fire God. Today we know exactly what fire is and we don't need to invoke some mythical explanation. Today's atheists know that there are many other questions we don't have answers for and it's OK to simply say we don't know instead of buying into the whole "let's-invent-some-god-to-explain-it" mentality....	notsarc
yes, i'm sure that's true as well. makes complete sense. but the article is saying that among those with unintended pregnancies, those who are using, are more likely to have an abortion than those who are not using. to me that makes sense as well, but i just wanted to clear up what it was saying.	i'm quite surprised this hasn't got more attention. usually all you have to do is whisper the word abortion around here and there's a firestorm. not that that was what i was going for, i'm just surprised. maybe this article is just too straightforward for people emoticonxangel	sarc
it should be legalised as it's no more harmful than alcohol or tobacco. not only that but many marijuana users end up going onto harder drugs through contact with their marijuana dealer. lesgalising it would break that link and actually reduce the level of drug addicts overall. furthermore you could tax it and put the money into more police to clamp down on hard drugs, which would be a good thing.	ah i see. so we take away the right of someone to do with their own body what they want to, unless they pay the government more money? sound a little too much like bribery to you too? and how would clamping down on hard drugs be a good thing? how about we concentrate on the real crimes in our society, and let people kill themselves/ruin their lives if they want to. why should i be spending tax dollars (ok, well hypothetically, pretend i pay taxes) to force someone else to not hurt themselves? sound a little counter-productive? and then we complain about a defecit?

You're right. Both clearly stated that they did not support gay marriage. The difference that is being pointed out in the article you quoted is this: Biden DID clearly say he believed gay couples should have equal rights when it came to things like hospital visitation, insurance, etc.[B] He asked Palin directly whether she believed the same [/b	Really?

that's information to you, not to the organism. if someone says the mountain will not get higher on it's own, and you go and dump dirt on it; you have not disproven them. by information they mean that records anything useful for the organism, including specific functions. now the average anti-evolutionist would like it to be just specific functions in which case you could just say novelty (information on how to create new systems). dna records useful data (information) for other things, it records modifications of existing systems to adapt to the environment. deletions of detrimental code is also information, although the net change is a loss. as for my previous arguments, they have been that there is no known law, physics, or calculation that would cause the construction of an novel system; leaving only probability.	that's one of the dumbest things i have ever heard. if these dummies don't have a problem with information increasing, but do have a problem with beneficial information increasing, don't you think there is a problem? you included. you don't have a problem with change, only good change bugs you. dumb!	sarc

It is entirely premature to be discussing this matter for the purpose of promoting political positions and beliefs. It is also disrespectful to those that died and their families to try and capitalize on their pain for a political agenda. No relevant details have been discovered or released yet meaning all that can be had is pure speculation and hyperbole.

your link to not go to a definition of marriage. ot goes to a link for the word: marauder-marauder - one who, while employed in the army as a soldier, commits a larceny or robbery in the neighborhood of the camp, or while wandering away from the army. so really what was your point cause you haven't made one!!!!	if you think marriage is sacred then why are you trying to change what it is? i can't say this enough times...marriage is a word that describes a union between man and women. no one created the word marriage and then decided what it would apply to. someone saw and event and gave this event a word...this would be marriage. this 'event' has been sacred since as long as we have records to show. and now, some wish to make it sacred for themselves while destroying the sacred institute that the majority of us wish to keep.	notsarc

] How many different ways can ToE be invalidated? In a scientific theory, there are NO exceptions -- exceptions mean holes -- holes mean trouble.The answer is none so far. Your article and the mechanism involved do not impact upon TOE which makes only very broad assumptions about heritable elements. And what you reference does not constitute a hole in TOE, although it may be a new mechanism of inheritance.	yea, I often forget ToE is a mental concept, not a scientific one. Nothing -- and I mean nothing -- will ever dismantle it in the minds of the faithful. Materialism is so entrenched in your mind that even if an animal generates a new piece of morphology by mere thought, sensation or awareness, and then passes that trait down to progeny, (which has been shown on here) you still think materialism stands.

I don't think pro-choicers in general care whether or not abortion is truly rare. If they did they would put more effort into making sure it is rare, and not just legal.	I know you're talking to Jessica, so I will only comment on this. It would be easier to make it rare if pro-life people weren't intent on making it illegal. Pro-choice people have to make it as available as possible to counter pro-life attempts to shut it down entirely.If pro-life people didn't exist, then the reasonable people could work towards making abortion rare.Take the current debates for example. My entire point is that it should not be illegal. That abortion should be available as a safe and legal choice (it can only be really safe if it's legal). We spend all our time and effort debating the legality that we spend no time on creating programs to help women choose to continue their pregnancies instead of having an abortion, legal or not.	notsarc

I put to you that you are the one discriminating on the basis of someone's size and development, since you would have it that a small, slightly developed person has a right to inhabit a womb, while a fully grown adult does not.	This isn't discrimination because the adult once did have have the right to live in a womb until it could live otherwise.

:It probably would have been better if Scalia had said to himself when the case was brought before the court, "There certainly is no consensus about the meaning of the Second Amendment and I, as an amateur historian, am certainly not going to force my own personal views on others. I will let the people decide through their elected representatives how much gun control is necessary in their own communities." Nice interpretation by Dennis Henigan of HCI. He would have loved that but pretending it hasn't been ruled as an individual right by the 82nd Congress, the DOJ in August 2004 with all the history and also by 35 Supreme Court rulings and TWO CENTURIES of lower court cases that fills a 660 pg. book with majority opinion, he is either deaf/blind or outright deceitful...I opt for the latter.He and they know full well that all the courts now are bound to consider any Second Amendment case as a civil rights issue thanks to this ruling."letting people decide" has already been done, once when the Constitution was ratified with the BOR and again when the XIVth Amendment was passed. He may as well say race issues will be decided by elected representatives the racial balance necessary in their own communities"He is completely dishonest and knows full well that this is a Republic based on the Law of the Land, The Constitution and not a democracy as he suggests. One may as well follow the Piper over the cliff like a herd of lemmings to not recognize this time worn tune played by the gun grabbers.

However one thing that works against evolution is this. It is just amazing that every creature on this planet didn't evolve to use the sun as a source of energy and food in some way or another.	Almost all did. In fact, probably all that you are aware of did. Even the energy in the steak that you eat came from the sun ultimately. The thing is that evolution seems to have resulted in an organism to take advantage of almost every form of available energy.

That even goes so far that there are some organisms that get their energy from geothermal sources - no light involved.	notsarc

Rubbish, there are many that argue otherwise. The life of twins can be viewed as starting at the moment the zygote/ embryo splits for example.The reality though is there is no single point at which a human life begins: the moment the egg and sperm form, the moment of conception, first division and implantation, the moment the heart starts to beat, the moment of birth etc all mark stages in the formation of a new life.	oh yeahrubbish rubbish,scientifically speaking, human life (using a most bsic term) begins at conception. the twins exist as two seperate entities the moment each contains the individual human dna. seems to me you better be certain when it begins before you go around ending it. if you are driving at night an you "think" you might see a person ahead in the middle of the road you are hopefully not gonna drive over that person.

of course it is known that wild animals that are sick just die from natural selection(they get eaten, or they don't manage to find food) and even livestock, if it has some disease, can be culled to prevent outbreak of disease. in humans it is different though, there are quarantine zones to prevent spread of certain disease. however, religion is sort of disease, but mind disease which can't be prevented to spread by some quarantine, but only by some great culling, and restricting it's spreading. religion is so embedded within (weak) human mind that it can't be removed normally(e.g. non violently, as those emotional weaklings would call it) but only by eradication.	i really hope you're joking. extremism is a disease, but not religion. religion can be, and is, for the most part, peaceful.	notsarc

You claim that the distinction between a baby being a bodily function of a woman or not is a matter of “empirical fact”, this is just not so. I think you should rethink what “empirical fact” is. Empirical fact, are facts that are said to be true on the basis of empirical observation. If I see a light on in a room, that is an empirical observation, and for me, that the light is on, is an empirical fact. However, if you and I both empirically observe at a fetus in a womb then the only empirical fact we could both agree on, I think, is that there is indeed a fetus in a womb. I say that fetus is part of a persons body performing a function, you say its something else, and that's a mater if ideology, not mere observation.	So for example if I say "you are a part of my body, and therefore I have a right to kill you", is this simply a matter of ideology?I admit the distinction is not clearcut at early stages of development, but how do you support the idea that post-birth children are "a part" of their mothers' bodies and therefore legitimate to kill?It is no more legitimate to say that a fetus is a part of a woman's body than it is to say that a woman is a part of a fetus' body. Just as a woman is not a subordinate slave to the fetus within her, the fetus cannot be considered subordinate in rights to the woman it is inside.	notsarc

#1 - How are we now able to observe evolution, when the evolution of the world supposely took billions of years?	Not all evolution takes place over billions of years. There has been speciation that we have actually seen occuring within a few years at a time. "bacteria, birds etcs."Natural selection occures frequently. You can "observe" evolution through the fossile record, DNA, morphology etcs.Evolution has made predictions, these predictions have come true, ergo, it's good.	notsarc
That reminds me of the discussion I got into on a "christian" board when I referred to a particular pompous XXX as a pompous XXX. I was banned for a week for using profane language. Pointing out that an XXX is an animal and that my remark made sense only in that light was fruitless. My answer was to demand that they ban some versions of the Bible because they told of how Abraham tied his XXX to a tree and Jesus sat on his XXX in Jerusalem. Didn't phase them. They also ignored without comment references to Judge Roy Moore's monumental erection in the rotunda of the Alabama Supreme Court building.	That is what supersport is hoping to do... However, assuming that you are correct in your interpretation, he has no chance of doing it so well.	notsarc
I agree, there is a difference between faith and inference. It seems though, that there is an element of faith in evolution. You must have faith that the evidence presented is accurate. You have to believe that the scientists are unbiased, etc.	Do you need faith to know the sun will rise tomorrow or that 2 + 2 = 4 or to know that if you drop a rock it will fall to the ground?	sarc
Evolutionists have taught for decades that the second law of thermodynamics—the entropy principle that things naturally decrease in complexity rather than increase—poses no barrier to evolution. Their claim is that while there is an overall downhill trend in nature, uphill innovations can occur locally in a system if abundant energy is available. Specifically the sun's energy provides all that is necessary to transform inorganic chemicals into a living cell and eventually into people. All that is necessary is an open system and abundant energy, especially the sun's energy. If complicated living organisms can be created in this way, certainly something not nearly so complicated as a house could be produced. Especially a solar-powered house!	That's obviously not what is said. The sun's energy is not claimed to be a mechanism that makes order of disorder. What it does do is override the tendancy within the 2LoTD where total usable energy in a system decreases.	notsarc
Then banning same-sex marrige would be wrong, and there would be no reason for it. Unless it harms someone, a law should never be passed.	A law baning same-sex marriage, then I'd agree. But the reason same-sex marriage doesn't exist (other than Mass.) is not because of law; after all, there are plenty of states that don't have same-sex marriage with no law that outlaws it. You're barking up the wrong tree--this is a cultural issue more than a legal one.	notsarc

so it’s the scientific community that sets up communication within a society, and then the dumb old common peasants come along and screw it all up? hahaha – sorry but i’m not convinced.  i’m not “in” science, other than unwillingly contributing my tax dollars – however small the percentage is – to a social agenda of those who control the scientific community. i’m permitted to have “theories” about it. emoticonxangel when the word “theory” is applied to a very wide range of subjects, it’s not fair to label someone who questions one theory a rejecter of all theories. that’s what the link in the opening post did – that’s not rational discourse, it’s not secular open inquiry, it’s not a search for truth or knowledge. it’s political/atheist rhetoric - look at the bottom of the page and whose name do we see? richard dawkins, what a surprise. and a quick google of “edgar pearlstein” shows a sarah palin hating atheist liberal just like him. emoticonxrolleyes science has a role in the control of the people atheists do, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that they represent science. you haven’t gotten in over your head – most who post here don’t know much about science. tq doesn’t, and of course he’ll tell you that i don’t. there’s a big difference between science, and the creation/ evolution controversy. many atheists who seem to be interested in science are actually only interested in it to the point that it helps them feel “intellectually fulfilled”, to discredit religion. some of the best reading on the creation/evolution controversy isn’t written by scientists, but by philosophers who have done just enough scientific homework on the subject to keep a clear focus on the controversy, without confusing it with too much detail. michael ruse and bradley monten are two excellent atheist authors on the subject. religious authors, practically too many to name. william dembski, david berlinski, phillip johnson, cornelius hunter, many others. you would do well to read anything by any of these people. far too many young people seem to make the mistake of getting most all of their information from rabid atheists who are also degreed biologists, like richard dawkins. he’s become a celebrity, and most degreed biologists who are not rabid atheists are a little to timid to take him on in a very direct way, without fear of discrimination, academic or otherwise. michael behe is one of the few who has been somewhat successful at it, not in avoiding discrimination, but in his ability to make a comfortable living in spite of it. read “the edge of evolution”, or “darwin’s black box” sometime. :) some irreducible complex structures, but not all of them. for atheists, that’s good enough. but it’s not good enough for everyone. in behe’s words; “…as biochemists have begun to examine apparently simple structures like cilia and flagella, they have discovered staggering complexity, with dozens or even hundreds of precisely tailored parts. …as the number of required parts increases, the difficulty of gradually putting the system together skyrockets, and the likelihood of indirect scenarios plummets.” behe wrote this in 1996, and since then it has only gotten worse for the atheists, no matter how much they dance.	When it comes to all the examples that Behe had provided in both his first book, and his second book , it has been shown to be able to evolve naturally.   That means, in principle, IC systems can evolve. If you don't believe so, bring forth the I.C. system of your choice.   To say 'But you don't know all the answers' is just the logical fallacy known as 'argument from ignorance'.   Behe brings a system up that he claims is IC.. the pathway for evolution is discovered, and Behe trys another one. How dishonest can you get?   The concept is falsified.	notsarc

In the following example that you provided: What is the context of the word 'truncated'? The way I read it - it is talking about a truncated string of code or something. What was truncated?... *more than 100 LPL gene mutations have been identified, the majority of which cause loss of enzymatic function. In contrast to this, the naturally occurring LPLS447X variant is associated with increased lipolytic function and an anti-atherogenic lipid profile and can therefore be regarded as a gain-of-function mutation. This notion combined with the facts that 20% of the general population carries this prematurely truncated LPL...*	The original molecule had some lipolytic function, but removing some amino acids from it, in the right place, made it fit better into the substrate, and thereby greatly increased its functionality. Barbarian observes:We thought it would take roughly a million years for bacteria to evolve enzymes capable of digesting nylon (because the compound is so different than any they were able to digest) but it took less than a century. .	notsarc

so are you are saying that because she wants an abortion she should have it? then why are you even against abortion? we are talking about a life here not just a fetus. i believe that everyone has a right to live. no fetus should pay the consequences because of a decision made by it's mother. in the year 2000, there were 1.3 million fetus that were killed and the same amount of families were waiting for children to adopt. if you are saying that nothing is wrong if a woman needs an abortion, the you are saying she can have repeat abortions. what if a woman who has unprotected sex and knows the consequences of her actions but later decides she wants an abortion? what is your opinion on that?	i think so too. every father should have a right to have a say when it comes to an abortion because that fetus was formed from their chromosomes and genetics. i am surprised that advocates for abortion are saying that men have no right to tell a woman how to control her body but yet they don't have a problem with the decision of the u.s supreme court in which all of the judges were men.	notsarc

I'm still having a hard time with this. If nothing exists, no matter, then how can "the number one" exist? On what basis is it defined? If there is only nothing, then you can't add to it, like I said 0+0=0.I know this is getting slightly off topic and philosophical, but it would seem to me that "concepts", and I'm not sure exactly how that's being defined, must have a basis in reality, and therefore in matter.I agree in that they are not created. I disagree in that IMHO, they are a function of our physical universe. IMHO, you don't have the concept without the universe to "define" it. I don't know, it's too early in the AM, maybe someone can point out the errors in my thinking.Waxy	addition works in the intangible as well. 1 minute + 1 minute = 2 minutes. 1 idea + 1 idea = 2 ideas. the concept of quantity is not limited to matter. if there was just a vaccous void were absolutely nothing was happening, then there would be no application of logic. but even that in itself would be logical. nothing + nothing = nothing is logical. it would actually be logical if a void with nothing added to it result in something. so even in a void, logic still prevails	notsarc
5) Moving on, if we look teh other way, evolution is actually a theory not physically proven, one of it s theory suggested that human started out in Africa while another in Asia, but if u look at them none resembles the other and none have a characteristic of an animal.	And of course, the theory of gravity isn't "physically" proven either. Neither is the heliocentric theory or atomic theory or the germ theory of disease. However, evolution has been observed to occur and the current theories are the best explanations that we have for the observations.

So why, in this gun-hater's dream come true of congress, did they choose not to advance a single gun control bill and have it signed into law?	I don't find it surprising. It's probably a strategic sacrifice on their part rather than a change in their personal views . They don't want to lose votes and possible support from gun owners for their priorities like health care reform because of a difference of opinion on gun control policy. They know that the Republicans are going to hit them with everything they've got during election time and exaggerated accusations about the Democrats wanting to take away people's guns would hurt them. The Republicans learned during the Clinton years that creating as much as paranoia as possible about the Democrats supporting big government is the way to regain a majority in Congress.

Some Iowa county recorders say they have contemplated refusing to give a marriage license to gay couples who walk into the office, but so far none is vowing to do so.“This is putting us in a very, very difficult position here,” Wayne County Recorder Angela Horton said Thursday in an interview. “But sometimes you have to put aside your personal beliefs, your religious beliefs, when you're doing a job you've sworn under oath to provide.”After hearing rumblings of discontent, a state official sent a strongly worded note to all recorders Thursday explaining why they should obey the Iowa Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage when it takes effect April 27.Victoria Hutton of the Iowa Department of Public Health informed recorders that the ruling has the force of law statewide: “All county recorders in the state of Iowa are required to comply with the Varnum decision … and to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples in the same manner as licenses issued to opposite gender applicants.”Republican state senators on Thursday crafted a new proposal that would give recorders an out if their religion is opposed to gay marriage, but Senate Democratic Leader Mike Gronstal scorned it as “blatantly unconstitutional.”State to counties: Obey gay marriage ruling, issue certificates | DesMoinesRegister.com | The Des Moines RegisterWhy is it that people of religion keep trying to seek special privilege for their religious beliefs?Do your job, or get out of the office.Why is it any more special for a "Christian" to have a "religious" belief against homosexuality, as opposed to a NON-Christian having a "non-religious" belief against homosexuality???	But let me guess ... if they step down RIGHT after they find they will have to issue to gay couples, you'd be in favor of them being able to be sued for it, simply because the "discrimination" in such an event was toward gays? Right? At least if you are consistent with your stance elsewhere in regards to 'timing' ... emoticonXRolleyesAnyway, aside from that inconsistency with your position elsewhere, I agree that county officials should need to comply. After all, there are probably OTHER examples whereby county officials have to do things that they are religiously against, such as issue divorce papers. Or marry some drunk couple that they know aren't really being serious even though they're tying the knot ... If all county officials could just refuse to do their job because of their objections--for WHATEVER reasons--it would be a collosal mess.	notsarc
I have already asked God for forgiveness and he has forgiven me.	So, then you DO feel that what you did was a sin. Otherwise you wouldn't have asked forgiveness for it.   I have one question. What was your motivation for starting this thread? Was it to try and somehow prove that a person can be a Christian and have an abortion? Just curious.

You'll have to specify which argument. My response was to your question "Can religious views be logical?"	I posted two versions:1. I am a rational being. Is it logical to assume that a rational entity formed me? (not my parents--on a mankind scale) Is it more logical than to assume that I generated out of inanimate matter incapable of logic? Generated due to "miraculous" odds? I'm not sure what the numbers are. I think the logical sequence is a belief in a higher power rather than a springboard to logic from a primordial soup of nothing.2. I came up with a belief in the supernatural via natural logic--I am a rational being. I could not have therefore come from irrational combinations of inanimate matter that somehow combined to form rational animate matter. I came from a rational source.	notsarc
You're wasting your time Phyllis, these spiritually dead empty suits are just too shallow to appreciate the value of a life they can't communicate with verbally. How pathetic they are not to appreciate that with all of the value and potential they see in themselves, that at one time they were exactly like these unborn children with the same mental existence they now claim is justification for their extermination.	There is the potential for a human that comes out of many, crude and vulgar things. Some end up on a maxi pad or when a guy reaches for the box of Kleenex. Should I feel a special bond with the conceptions rudely flushed out because they couldn't make it to the uterine wall? They had the potential, the DNA, were once a life too, and made a valiant effort. Life is constantly in motion. We don't value all life, or maybe not all life the same.

Most evolutionists believe that matter and time were created by a "Big Bang."	But recognition of the big bang as a very good explanation of cosmology isn't limited to evolutionsits. In fact, most other scientists also believe so, most especially cosmologists and astrophysicists, who are directly concerned with the early universe. Evolutionists, even though the origin of matter and time are irrelevant to the study of evolution, are also educated in science and probably accept the work done by these other scientists.	notsarc

Cappy: How sad that you are unable to get this through your twisted brain. The woman with the help of a man, determined a pregnancy. The natural course of any pregnancy is 40 weeks of gestation then live birth. That is the NORMAL, NATURAL course. A woman wanting to end that pregnancy at any point of the gestational period is going against the normal course of nature. The government, in such cases, in the interest of the continuation of the human species, should be able to assist these pregnancies through to live births and make adoptions easier, NOT enable murder.	Ok, so if we are going to let everything take the "normal course of nature", then lets just let everyone die. Have cancer? Too bad, its the natural course of nature that you die.

I would disagree here about this, in terms of the pro-life view. It's not that mental existence is irrelevant ... quite the contrary; in fact it's the reality that there will SOON be mental existence that makes it matter. I don't think the issue of abortion should ever be divorced from the reality that the embryo will likely grow into a human being ... a human that is human by pretty much anyone's standards. So I suspect that the big difference here is that pro-choicers are more "in the moment" in terms of the way they view the fetus, and pro-lifers are more "long-term bigger-picture" in terms of the way they view the fetus. Certainly the likely potential of what the fetus grows into has a lot to do with the pro-life position on whether it is truly human.	But growth is fairly irrelevant. My sperm can grow into a human too, and have mental existence, yet ejaculating isn't murder. It just becomes a huge debate on where to draw the line, therefore it is best to focus on the state that it is right NOW. Not what it was or could possibly be.That seems reasonable to me.[/QUOTE]	notsarc

Without question my largest beef with God would have to be the fact that according to the Bible you need to believe in God in some fashion or another in order to make it into heaven. The reason this is my beef with him is because it is much more difficult to believe in him when you are born in India than if you are born in the US or Europe. The Indian culture is that of Hinduism and a mix of other religions unlike that of the US and Europe which is primarily Christian. That means being born in the US or Europe gives you a better chance of making it to heaven as you are more likely to end up being a Christian and believing in God. Would the be at all fair if this were the case? My answer is plainly and simply no! It is idiotic infact. If God existed and he was perfect then almost without a doubt he would have to base getting into heaven on the actions of a person instead of the beliefs of a person to be fair. His system would not be at all perfect if being born in one place means you get into heaven while being born in another place means you don't get into heaven. Furthermore this means that he needs to take into consideration other influences on your life including whether or not your parents or community were proper places to grow up and whether or not you were ever given the proper situation in which to change your life to God's expectations. If not given any opportunities or given very few and still turning out to be a decent person should be better than if you turned out to be a decent person and were given many opportunities to end up this way. God in all his perfection would need a very complicated system to judge who gets into heaven in order for it to be fair but I just don't see spelled out in the Bible.	Why would anyone want to get to Heaven? Archangel and people like him would be there, praying and chanting 24/7 . Thanks but no thanks!	sarc

'prostitution is not a victimless crime as there are child prostitutes, and the human trafficking among other things.' the reason human trafficking if prevelent in prostitution is exactly because it is illegal. if you legalised prostitution, supply of (and demand for) native prostitutes will rise dramatically. do you not see that trafficking and child prostitution would actually be lowered by legalising prostitution? 'legalization of prostitution would lead only to ... a further spread of hiv/aids.' again, do you not see how there would actually be a reduction in sexually transmitted viruses if prostitution were regulated and legalised? the majority of problems with prostitution are directly attributed to their illegal status.	oh really xaeon? netherlands has had prostitution legal for years and they are one of the most primary destinations for humans being trafficked. europe has many countries who have legalized prostitution but suffer from increased human trafficking. but maybe the us is different?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prostitution_in_the_netherlands  with it legalised more people are having sex with whores, and as soon as a whore is infected she doesn't even know it yet, so if she gets infected with hiv she still has sex with customers up until the day her next 'check up' is which is usually once a week. what happens to the infected prostitute? she gets kicked out onto the street. so thats one more woman infected, and possible many more men.	notsarc

Here's a quote from mayr regarding selection,"Only relatively few individuals in a given generation would qaulify and survive the selection procedure. That small sample would be able to preserve only a small amount of the whole variance of the parental population. Such survival selection would be highly restrained." What Evolution Is. pg. 118So....do you evolutionists agree with this? Let's take humans. Are only a few people in this generation "fit" enough to go on to breed? Is Mayr smoking crack or what?????? This theory is pathetic.	And what is the full quote? Was it talking about, lets say for example, tutles, where over 90 percent of them die before reaching adulthood?In many species, that is true.

we are all entitled to self-defense, but not all that is legal or moral is advisable. i am not against gun rights, or for the mad-regulators of the left; but if i were zimmerman right now (assuming he is telling the truth) i would be kicking myself now until the day i die for not carrying pepper spray and trying that first. for investigating further when the police told me to keep my distance. for not telling martin i had a gun and i was willing to use it before he got close enough to knock me down. i agree there is plenty of possible damning evidence either way. one piece that would change everything is if zimmerman threw the first punch; in which case trayvon would be defending himself and maybe zimmerman shot him because he was losing. that would not contradict known facts.	freedom dearie are you serious about pepper spray? just yesterday i presented a story where a taser and bean bag rounds from a shotgun did literally nothing against a 68 year old with a bad heart condition. what can a cheap chemical agent do against an adrenaline charged youth who's got more vitality and health on his side than a senior citizen in new york?	notsarc
Well, you stated that gun control "worked well" in Europe during the 30s, which was the time of the holocaust. By stating gun control "worked well", I assumed that you supported or condoned what the nazis were doing to the Jews. However, I assume I was incorrect. And regarding you and Steeeve's childish attacks, I will ignore them at the moment, but if you decide to resume this behavior I will be forced to report it.

Anyhow, I have no problems with the Archaeopteryx. It was an interesting creature, but simply having features present from two different forms (bird and dinosaur) doesn't mean it is a link?	Yes, you do have a problem with Archaeopteryx. You can't explain it from a creationist point of view. I'm not claiming that it is a "link," whatever that may be. It is a transitional form. It is a small theropod dinosaur that has characteristics that are common to theropod dinosaurs and only theropod dinosaurs and their ancestors. It also has characteristics that exist in birds and only birds. Some characteristics exist in both. The furcula, for example. A furcula has been identified in some theropods, but it is rather rare and then only imprefectly preserved. An indication that it may be mostly connective tissue. Archaeopteryx has a furcula. But even at that it doesn't compare to the same structure in birds. It is intermediate. Imagine that!	notsarc

this outta be good. a creationist actively making himself look like a complete idiot. normally we have to pay for kind of entertainment.  besides, even if he somehow manages to prove that ridiculous claim, that doesn't actually prove god. like i said, normally we have to pay for kind of entertainment.	whoa! duo. give the kid a chance. it seems that you are skeptical that he can offer empirical 'proof' that his god exists. certainly, since he is a 'philosophy and theology' major he must understand the implications of 'proof' in the context of science, as well as the meaning of the term 'empirical'. after all, wouldn't those ideas be something that a philosopher would be expected to understand? so let's await his 'empirical proof' without laughter. wait until he presents his 'empirical proof' before we laugh.	sarc

... here is what is hard to understand about that; In Matthew, 12:30, Jesus says "He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters".	But Miller is with Jesus (and by extension, you): he says that God exists and that Christianity is true. Or, if you insist that he's against you, you're left with this conundrum: You call Miller and theistic evolutionists incorrect, and he calls you and anti-evolutionists incorrect; why is your position any more logical than his?Regarding your citation about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts, you omit the remainder of the paragraph. Shame on you, marc, for your quote mine. Miller clearly continues with "philosophical pronouncements" that many atheists do not forward. Over the following three paragraphs, he examines a single philosophical insinuation -- not a plethora of them -- and then moves beyond "atheistic philosophical pronouncements."	notsarc

You seem to think that child services only did this investigation this week. This was an investigation conducted in Feb, and the police and DA office would certainly have access to the report. The fact that they executed warrants and arrested wacko says that perhaps they have more to their case than this investigation.

I did not say that I thought that, that would be putting words in my mouth. Sure they'd have access to the report... Sneddon probably had his grubby hands on it ASAP.

In affirming the absolute sanctity of life, we deny the sanctity of particular lives by putting them at the disposal of others - in the case of abortion, affirming the absolute sanctity of the baby's life involuntarily subordinates the mother to the child.

SCHUMER: OK. Now, let me ask you this. When you wrote that statement, you did not -- as we discussed yesterday -- when you wrote that the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion, you had no exceptions. So that would mean, at least in 1985, your view then, there would be no constitutional protection for a woman to terminate her pregnancy even if the termination was needed to preserve her future ability to have children, right?ALITO: Senator, it was a general statement that didn't go into -- it didn't...SCHUMER: But it had no exceptions. You didn't make that...ALITO: It was one sentence, and it certainly didn't represent...SCHUMER: There was no -- you didn't write any exception for that situation. Correct? It just said the Constitution does not protect. It was without exception. And, yesterday, you didn't argue me when I mentioned that without exception.ALITO: I don't recall your using the words without exception. SCHUMER: I think I did.(CROSSTALK)SCHUMER: If you believe...ALITO: Could I just answer that question? It's one sentence and it certainly is not an attempt to set out a comprehensive view of the subject.SCHUMER: No, I understand that. But it was a very strong statement. It didn't talk about any exceptions at all. And the way I read that statement, even if a woman was raped by her father, she'd have no constitutional protection to have an abortion and terminate that pregnancy. If you believe the Constitution protects no right to an abortion that would follow, wouldn't it?ALITO: I think the statement speaks for itself, and it's one sentence and it's not an effort to set out a comprehensive view of...SCHUMER: Knowing these examples, do you still refuse to distance yourself in any way from a broad, unqualified statement, without exception, that the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion? No ands, ifs or buts, is my words.ALITO: What I actually said was that I was proud of my participation in the Thornburg case in which the government made the argument that it made in the Thornburg case...SCHUMER: But you said in the previous sentence to that statement that you personally held those views.ALITO: That's correct. But what I was talking about there was the Thornburg case and nothing more than the Thornburg case.SCHUMER: I understand. But you haven't rethought the position at all, even knowing these extreme cases and the hardship that it might cause?ALITO: Well, what you have pointed out is exactly why, if the issue were to come up, and one were to get beyond stare decisis, the whole judicial decision-making process would have to be gone through.SCHUMER: You didn't think that through in 1985?ALITO: I was not involved in...SCHUMER: When you wrote the statement. When you wrote that statement.ALITO: And when I wrote the statement what I was saying was that I was proud of what I had done in relation to the Thornburg case, which was to write the memo that the committee is aware of, which did not argue that Roe should be overruled, did not argue that the government should argue that Roe should be overruled, but that the decision should be challenged on other grounds that were quite similar.SCHUMER: I understand what you wrote, but you also -- we can bring the statement up here, but I don't want to go over the thing of yesterday. I would just ask you to think of all the consequences of a broad statement, even from 1985, that the Constitution does not protect the right to abortions. Not an exception of health of the mother, not an exception of rape or incest, not an exception of any of these others. I didn't see any of those in your job application. But I want to conclude on...ALITO: Senator...SCHUMER: Go ahead, please.ALITO: It was one sentence. And I think what you're saying highlights the importance of not addressing this until the judicial process takes place where all of this complexity would be taken into account.SCHUMER: In all due respect, sir, I think it highlights the importance of an obligation to discuss it, particularly in light of a strong statement before.But we'll have to differ on that.	Schumer is a bonafide idiot, as are many in the Senate. He failingly tried to draw Alito into exposing how he would rule on abortion if presented a case. Alito is far too intelligent to be logically trapped by a buffoon such as Shumer.It is also plain to see he interrupts when he supposes the response will indeed make sense against his flailings.	notsarc

(Playing devil's advocate)And, by what authority would you deny a woman's "right to choose" an abortion that happens to be "late in her pregnancy?"	Thats a very good question. To be honest - I would prefer no legislation period - but I would not get up in arms about a late term restriction like I described because 1) a fetus could very well survive outside of the mom at that point, 2) most reputable doctors won't conduct an abortion at that stage without a legitimate medical reason anyway.	notsarc
ooo, you had your gut cut open??  what a pity. i think you could have avoided alot of suffering if you had just used a condom. if you don't want another mouth to feed then just take birth control or use a condom.  why shouldn't fetuses have rights? once they're a fetus, then eliminating them is technically killing them. and at nine months, they're no longer dependent on it's mother's blood, and therefore is technically a baby. at nine months, you're not killing a fetus, you're killing a baby.	why do you assume the poster didn't use birth control? they said nothing about birth control; only a statement on being pregnant and having an abortion. also, why do you make any assumptions about suffering? according to the poster, suffering was avoided. condoms are not 100% effective. a childhood friend's younger sibling was the product of a failed condom, among other factors. nine months and nine weeks are completely different.	notsarc

And for decades, evolutionist fools proclaimed they had decoded the Book of Life….they said that individual genes controlled individual traits. Well all that came to a crashing halt when the Human Genome Project showed that the one-gene/one-phenotype concept was indeed a fairytale. Instead, to the shock and dismay of teary-eyed evolutionists, they found that the human genome only has about 25,000 genes – over 100,000 short of their estimate. This meant their theory about how they thought life worked had to be scrapped.	So a theory was revised... does that mean that it was wrong afterwards?	notsarc
Chuz, the purpose of this summary is not to summarise your arguments as a whole - it is to summarise what your argument is up to this point. Why not post just a summary of your position so far, as you see it - I can do the same, then you can continue with your argument?There's no point in writing an argument, summarising it and then leaving the thread before I've had a chance to respond to even your argument (never mind your summary). If you are going to simply ignore any criticisms of your reasoning, then I struggle to see the point of you repeatedly requesting a one-on-one debate in the first place - you essentially regress your argument to the 'because I said so' that you are (presumably) hoping to avoid, it's just that there's slightly more detail.	I see your point, Iangb but I'm not about to be leaving before you've had a chance to respond. I won't be "leaving" at all.

Since anti gay christians are doing all these things to gay people then that is how they want gay people to treat christians.	sarc

my biggest problem with the gay rights issue is their tireless and often deceptive efforts to drag science into the whole thing. we know that there is nothing that ties biology and genes into sexual orientation, yet the gay society insists that there is, supporting shabby studies with inconclusive results and publishing them as facts. i have absolutely no problem with the gay lifestyle, marriage rights or social place. but when it must be done under the guise of false science, there is a problem from what ive seen, homosexuality, and sexuality on a whole, is indeed a complex issue. it is misunderstood, and many 'authorities' on the subject submit conflicting reports, making the issue even more complicated. not only that, but people guard their sexuality with strong emotions, and therefore tend to believe what they want to believe about it. it makes finding the truth 10 times more difficult.	we do? how do we know that? i will agree that there is not yet proof to make such a link, but i am unaware of proof that there is no link. did i miss something?	notsarc
