I got a good idea . however , they do tend to stay with their own .
Be sure to give your guns a big fat kiss tonight before you go to bed tonight 'cuz guns did really good today .
One of the biggest arguments against gun control is that if the government became too oppressive , the people would n't have the capacity to carry out a successful rebellion . Of course , if the government was becoming oppressive , it would likely implement gun control , so the absence of gun control is necessary to ensure that we do not take a plunge towards fascism !
First of all , compare the `` B '' specimen in your fossil link to the modern specimen and point out any significant difference to me .
There are some incedents that are beyond your control . If you own a rifle or large handgun , it 's at your own risk .
So the answer to your question is that there is no answer .
Legality does not matter . Religous implications do not matter . Other peoples moral considerations do not matter . What matters is YOU and what YOU are going to think about yourself in 5 years .
It can go both ways . We all doubt . It is what you do with it that matters .
once again , you seem to support the killing of certain people ... based on what ?
I personly would not condone an abortion , however i would n't condem a person who wanted one : its there choice . you ca n't pass your ideas of when life began ect on to another person but its highly debatable and each person has a right to decide for themselves . you can not prove life begans at conception , and the burden of proof for taking away one 's rights relys on proof . points 1 ) child birth is dangerious , deadly and painful . many women have died during child labor . due to our bi-pedalism the female hip is much smaller than it should be making it most of the time impossible to give birth ( thus a c-section ) how can you force someone to carry around a child they do not want for 9 months ? 2 ) rape 3 ) if you try to stop it , you wo n't . you will just put it back on the street ( much like drugs ) doctors will be preforming back alley abortions . 4 ) if your mother doesnt ' want you who will ? people say oh adoption is in such high demand . true : however its not because of a lack of children its because of buerocratic XXXXXXXX . the gov . does n't want to be responsible for child abuse so they over screen adoption parents and make it diffucult to get a child . the cost is astronomical . 5 ) overpopulation is a problem . note : religion should not influence your decision in law making . only in personal moral decisions .
First , there is no `` us '' on your part regarding this . I am talking to you . Others here that argue your same positions have been much less beligerent , so as far as I 'm concerned your attitude sets you apart . Second , I was n't trying to give you justification , nor am I obligated to . You should be giving justification for wanting to redefine marriage as an institution which you have n't done . But I do n't owe you any justification . Take your silly games up with Mana'ia ; they wo n't work with me . You 're right , as well as having the institution of marriage on the line . But you are the one who seems to think this is a game , based on your posts . ( with your comments like `` you 've won '' ; `` he 's lost '' , and other silly things , as if this is a basketball game or something . ) It seems you 'd do well to take your own advice . If you want people to constantly have to `` justify '' something to you , then you should make your own compelling arguments first ; throw something out there yourself rather than expect everyone else to do it for you . No one owes you anything here . As for me , I 'm not interested in your little games .
alright how did evolution start ?
Do you not even get statutory sick pay ?
Too bad . That does n't automatically give you the excuse to support discredited beliefs . and it gives you no protection when others tell you to shut up and change your argument to address the facts . Abortion was never in the Constitution . However the Second Amendment and gun ownership is , was , and always has been . Roe v. Wade was judicial activism , Heller was just the courts doing their job after 30 long years of trying to avoid the subject . The two cases are n't comparable in the least . Stop using them .
Correctly viewed , evolution is not a series of unlikely events , but a series of highly likely ones . It is highly likely , for instance , that some bacteria in a large colony would experience a mutation enabling the digestion of nylon . Sure - breaking that event down on a per-bacterium basis yields tiny probabilities , but why stop there ? Why not break it down on a per-bacterium , per-microsecond basis ? The chances just got even smaller ! See ? It 's a silly way to think about it , because in the end it 's the chance of the event occurring that matters , not some arbitrary deadline by which it must occur or cell to which it must occur .
Strange , I was under the impression this article was referring to the Roman Catholic Church .
And dont you get a kick out of SP calling herself a rational christian as she blasphemes God and attempts to disprove Him in every post ? This is a person who does n't even know what the word hypocrite means , so she keeps that label under her user name .
Well , I was n't an fortunate as you . It took me a few years to see through the fairy tale of evolution and see that God was the only true creator . However , that is a whole 'nother topic .
i love these kinds of arguments ! both sides are in denial and see the other as stupid . only one of them can be right , or else . hooray ! pass the popcorn !
Actually , I strongly disagree with gay marriage anyway . It just is n't marriage . It is hypocritical and just plain disugusting .
That gives me an idea . Why do n't we have a competition to come up with the best suggestion for a display or show at this theme park ? The winner gets to feel smug for being so clever
And I 'd think the explanation would be that oxygen content was much different before the flood
Then , there are various fossilization mechanisms . I could n't find any good information about the rates of said mechanisms , so I thought this thread might start some good debate on the subject because of that . Now , how long did the fossilization take ? Did it take 10 or 10,000 or 10,000,000 years ? Are the fossils we see all the result of one big 'tragic ' event for all , or little 'tragic ' events for each ? Any thoughts ?
Do you mean sexually molesting children ? Again , I think that harms and forces something on someone .
And the king of Babylon smote them and put them to death at Riblah , in the land of Hamath-thus Judah was exiled from its land . Rather , a sceptre refers exclusively to rulership , not political independence , as seen in the following passage .

I know of no one that is pro life believes the mother should die so the baby can live .
Okay , in defense of my school ( KU ) is n't creation ( Intelligent Design-which I have to question that title since it has been mostly Bush pushing for it ) a religion thing ? Science is supposed to tell how something happens ( happened ) . The creation story in the ( Christian/Jewish/Islamic ) Bible does not tell how . It tells more of a why or what . It was never intended to be about how God did anything . I specify the creation story here ( which these three are the exact same beginning because they are the exact same God ) because when people say ID , they are referring mostly to the creation in Genesis . All you get is a poetry reading almost of what happened . ( And then God did such and such . ) There is a difference between What happened and How it happened . There is nothing scientific about it at all . There is nothing wrong with teaching it in a religions class or some kind of social studies class .
While indeed marriage was once a religious ceremony , it is fairly clear that ceremony has been taken away from the religion and added as an American tradition , so to speak . I know of someone who once proposed that we get rid of marriage altogther and give everyone civil unions except for thos acknowledged by the church . As feasible as that may be , marriage is too rooted in our American culture . For that reason it is best to truly offer rights to everyone as our constitution so rightly protects .
Just wanted some peoples opinions
`` They believe that mechanistic evolution is just too improbable . '' Ah ... do they now . You see , Berkinski et al seem to have a limited comprehension as to what causes life to change in space and time . Where they see improbability I see inevitability- life , in whatever form we care to discuss , is vying to survive against a whole battery of challenges . Some of those challenges confront it on a short term basis- the need for food , suitable environmental conditions in which to survive and so on . Others may be an issue over a longer period of time- the need to find a mate and reproduce , can it survive annual changes in local climates . Ultimately , life has to be able to adapt to the longest term changes- like a major shift in underlying climatic conditions or local topography . And so on- we can consider a whole host of changes that confronts life at various times over different timescales . What is clear from such consideration is the never ending need for life to able to adapt- the Earth is a dynamic and forever changing place ( even the very ground beneath you now is transient in nature ) and environments have changed dramatically over the course of this planets history . If life were still and static it would never have come to be in the first place . If it can not adapt to a new challenges quickly enough- well just think of all the examples we have of life that is extinct . So I really can not see why Berkinski and his peers find natural evolution , or whatever you care to call it improbable- the driving forces are there to see if you are inclined to learn about them . What I really find improbable is the notion of an omnipotent supernatural enitity outside of the physical universe somehow being able to comprehend and interact with the life in ours- and even to have the desire to do so !
If only that were the case . It 's pretty easy to 'shoot down ' an anti , since they rarely have any kind of evidence to support their emotional claims that guns are bad . I was engaged via private message on another forum by a user ( who regularly boasted of his recreational drug use ) who insisted guns were bad . When challenged with stats from the British Home Office ( the person in question was a Briton ) he replied something along the lines of 'Well , I do n't care any more ' . Which I considered odd , as it was he who initiated the debate . Given that , and other comments during our brief correspondence , I concluded that he could not reconcile the stats with his stance ( the fact that rape , homicide , violent assault and theft all increased while rates of firearm ownership decreased , and the police themselves were dis-armed ) and simply refused to admit his position may have been poorly informed .
Here 's the relevant point of exposing how evolutionists dealt with defining the Coelacanth . Before evolutionists knew that living examples of this fish existed , they never even hesitated in taking the observable physical features it exhibited and thought nothing of creating a completely inaccurate and totally fictional biography of that fish 's evolutionary journey . They not only claimed that it crawled on the Sea bottom which proved it was an intermediary fish , but they made assumptions based on the fact that it birthed its young live rather than being an egg layer .
If private firearms were to be made illegal across the board , I suggest to you the civil unrest you speak of would be epidemic in our nation . The US , as it has stood constitutionally for 215 years , though wobbly at times , would cease to have existed , as envisioned by the founders of our country , and having been sacrificed for by so many brave men and women . That is my opinion , and of course , may not be shared by many .
Why do you expect me to provide evidence when you never do ?
Why ? What has caused you to believe such things ?
So taking peoples rights away is an american value ? I think I will push for legislation to make cancer surgery illegal . After all cancer cells are human life too and with modern medical tech they could become a human being also .
The women of Islam need to become feminists . That 's all that 's needed .
The coelacanth , according to fossil records , and according to evolutionists , allegedly went extinct millions and millions of years ago . Until they were found alive . left an abundant fossil record from the Devonian to the end of the Cretaceous period , at which point they apparently suffered a nearly complete extinction . Coelacanth - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia As if this should be any surprise . The theory of evolution mindset once again contradicts observable science .

Well , the type of atheism you are talking about here requires faith . If you say `` I know there is no god , '' this statement requires faith . You have not observed anything that would lead you to reason or deduce that there must not be a god . The presence of religion has nothing to do with this faith and it 's not a religion , just a gross assumption with no `` proof . '' First , I did not say that `` I know there is no god . '' What I said ( here I am expanding and clarifying my original statement `` I understand that there is no god '' ) or meant to say is simply that there is no evidence to support the existence of such a thing as god . As to your second statement ; you may want to rephrase it . The inability to prove a negative is an invalide argument . You can not `` prove '' that invisible fairies do not live in your attic . You can , however , believe that they do . The belief that they do requires faith , the understanding that they do not results from lack of any evidence that they do .

I would have to say that whoever told you about 'macro-evoution ' from a science perspective obviously did not explain things properly . It sounds like your 'science advice ' was either misunderstood or the advice was 'stacked ' .
No Montalban , fallacy or falsity will not persuade me to think a true claim is false .

Pro choicers claim they are for the rights of women . If that is true why do n't pro-choicer want the pregnant women who seek abortion to be informed . I read yesterday , how the pro-choice people are trying to block legislation that would help women make better CHOICES about their pregnancy . If I find the link , I 'll post it , but the legislation was anyone who seeks an abortion , must have access to a sonogram before the abortion . That having an abortion `` may '' cause post-abortion stress syndrome , which for some it does ! It 's sad , pro-choicer , do n't want women to be `` informed '' to the best of their ability . Sonogram can be helpful tool to the WOMAN in helping her make a better CHOICE , and are n't pro-choicers all about CHOICE . So why block this legislation ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? I do n't understand why pro-choicers have so much hate .
Mongoloid ? Is this 1937 ?
i didnt mention good anywhere in my post this is totally false . the laws of logic being absolute does nothing to support a case for god . in fact , everything the bible tells us about god 's nature indicates that god is illogical , unpredictable , unreliable and irreplicable . this is totally the opposite of logic
Biology is centered around the theory of evolution . Without it , biology is hardly biology .
The Queen does n't allow them to get sick .
A woman owns her head , just as she owns the rest of her body . If you accept women as legitimate self-owners and not a slave caste , both the legality of abortion and the illegality of steamrolling their heads follows .
So does this mean they have to get tougher on gun control or softer before the results go their way ? That is the real question . My guess is that we are caught in the unhappy medium where going in either direction will be more successful than where we are now .

Sex is a norman part of a healthy relationship .
Creationists are very open about the relationship between belief and science in the study of history .
Your answers were without content or meaning . There was no sarcasm .
For instance the Yucca plant has a moth that waits dormant for 80 to 150 years beside it to pollinate it on the one day it blooms in all that time . How did that evolve ? Or was IT that did it ?
Simple ... evolutionary science is science and creationism is not ? How does creationism even meet the science standards ... well it does not . Creationism assumes god , therefore it can not be a science . Science and faith based creationism are not the same fields of study . For some religious people I know this is not a problem , but for the religious right it is .
Hobbes specifically said that this is not the case . Cooperation exists , and is essential . Without it , the life of man would be `` a war of all against all '' , and would be `` solitary , nasty , brutish , and short . '' But man is inherently , biologically social , at the level of the family and the tribe . Daniel Boone , moving further into the wilderness whenever he could see the smoke from someone else 's cabin , or solitary hermits in the desert , are quite rare , and even they are dependent on the rest of society for sustenance . Solitary confinement is one of the worst punishments short of serious physical damage . Nor is a war of all against all true in evolution . Evolutionary theory includes the evolution of cooperation and altruism along with murder , hunting , and the like . For example , the cooperation of the cells in your body to form organs that support each other , and the mechanism of apoptosis by which most pre-cancerous cells and others that have suffered damage destroy themselves . Or the convergent evolution of numerous species of hive and nest insects ( and naked mole rats ) from solitary precursors . Or the cooperative evolution of eye and brain structures from light-sensitive cells , or bird 's wings along with hollow bones , or symbiosis of all kinds , including intracellular organelles such as mitochondria . Coevolution of bees and flowers is another instance . Or crocodiles not eating the birds that clean their teeth .
And since when was there a dichotomy between freedom and socialism ?

Gay marriage is outlawed in Texas and many other states . It 's not a `` right '' around these parts , and never will be .
I think the main pro-life argument from the libertarian camp is that pro-life laws are a form of `` negative intrusion , '' just like laws against murder , rape or theft . Libertarian ideology centers around a belief in negative government - a government that can effectively protect its citizens from rapists , murderers , thieves , etc . They oppose both positive government ( i.e . totalitarianism ) and anarchy . Granted , I am not certain if anti-abortion laws are truly negative intrusion . These Libertarians for Life seem to have it figured out , but I am not sure if anti-abortion laws are positive or negative intrusion .

It is just incredible to me that so many people accept the basic premise that evolutionists put out there , which is that there is enough variation within a species that would genetically disallow a portion of the population to breed .

`` Six pairs of these aortic arches loop over the pharynx . In primitive fish , these arches persist and enable the gills to oxygenate the blood . In adult birds and mammals , in which lungs oxygenate the blood , such a system makes little sense - but all six pairs of aortic arches are formed in mammalian and avian embryos before the system eventually becomes simplified into a single aortic arch . Thus , even though our physiology does not require such a structure , our embryonic condition reflects our evolutionary history . '' ( Developmental Biology : Seventh Edition , Scott F. Gilbert , Sinauer Associates Inc. , 2003 , p500 )

How about you actually prove something for a change instead of expecting everybody else to do your work for you .
Within the community of Christian believers there are areas of dispute and disagreement , including the proper way to interpret Holy Scripture . While virtually all Christians take the Bible seriously and hold it to be authoritative in matters of faith and practice , the overwhelming majority do not read the Bible literally , as they would a science textbook . Many of the beloved stories found in the Bible  the Creation , Adam and Eve , Noah and the ark  convey timeless truths about God , human beings , and the proper relationship between Creator and creation expressed in the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation . Religious truth is of a different order from scientific truth . Its purpose is not to convey scientific information but to transform hearts . We the undersigned , Christian clergy from many different traditions , believe that the timeless truths of the Bible and the discoveries of modern science may comfortably coexist . We believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth , one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests . To reject this truth or to treat it as one theory among others is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children . We believe that among Gods good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our Creator . To argue that Gods loving plan of salvation for humanity precludes the full employment of the God-given faculty of reason is to attempt to limit God , an act of hubris . We urge school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge . We ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion , two very different , but complementary , forms of truth .

As for who plays 'word-games ' , it seems that you missed this ... # 19 `` New peppered moth stuff '' He went on for some time trying to undermine my posts based on the use of a word which most people have a problem with . There 's also the problem with Darwin claiming a tautology was a better term than `` Natural Selection '' , this was debated for some time , even though I posted the actual words of Darwin . The thread `` Unto the Ages of Ages '' developed into a debate over whether something could be both ''more accurate ' and wrong , thanks Ursus ! WJA and SLP argued over the word 'applied ' , then 'published ' ; whether Dembski had , and then changed this to 'proved ' ( see `` Looking for intelligence '' thread ) Lurch/Ungerdunn etc over what is a 'noun ' . Multiple personalities aside , this debate over 'nouns ' lasted for months . He resorted to no better argument then 'you 're wrong ' . A great debating style ! As for debating styles ... . Waxy enters a debate on Science/Math says that I 've been refuted somewhere else , by someone else , and then leaves ; does the same thing on these Creation/Evolution debates ... only adds a few insults in the process ... not wishing to debate , just to name call . Mach is happy to admit he does n't read my posts/skims over them but wants to both debate and not debate them - claiming he 's got a time problem ... and asks me to post stuff he 's already replied to Would you count as a word-game the two incidents where you 've made a claim about me being insulting , and when I 've asked you to point it out , you ca n't ? One time you were so flustered you told me you were going to warn everyone about me . You make allegations then do n't back them up . Archilochus makes allegations that I do n't understand the word 'chance ' but is un-prepared to come up with a definition , just repeats that I do n't understand it . He 'll go on repeating this , because it is a replacement for debate . All the while you guys are very shy when it comes to debating each other 's mistakes ; such as Hank describing the world as egg-shaped , etc . In short you make so many 'just-so ' statements with little recourse to evidence , in an effort to drown out anyone who differs in opinion from yourself . Hence the total unwillingness to seriously tackle anyone from your own side who is either a ) wrong or b ) rude But in short , if someone posts here a statement , and they ca n't even be sure what they mean by it , then it does n't bode well . That is what has upset a number of people ; when this has been pointed out . This is also why many pro-evolutionists are so quick to resort to ad hominem here . That 's what this thread of yours is an attempt at - and at best it is something that suggests only other people are guilty of this crime .
Getting back to the original question ... yes , i think it is very reasonable to be against abortion and for a war . I do n't thin anybody is `` for war '' , but rather `` for a war '' . Each one is different and needs to be evaluated separately .

This error becomes immediately evident if we amend Thompson 's illustration . What if the mother woke up from an accident to find herself surgically connected to her own child ? What kind of mother would willingly cut the life-support system to her two-year-old in a situation like that ? And what would we think of her if she did ?
18th Century Pennsylvania , which had its own RKBA , passed a law which required citizens to take an oath of allegiance to the state or face being disarmed . This was to protect the state against those who might be loyal to the British Crown . So why ca n't the US take similar measures to protect itself against terrorists ?

Would you consider abortion in the following four situations ?
Biologically speaking , the fetus is human
I would n't disagree with you that abortion is murder . I do n't agree with executions either nor do I agree with wars . A life is lost when an abortion occurs . This is almost undefendable unless you want to debate whether a life even existed at the time of the abortion . I also accept that society is hurt by people having abortions . Women especially suffer psychological trauma from the loss of their child .
So , I guess you did n't get the memo that this country was FOUNDED on Christian/Judaic beliefs . Remember : You do have rights ; to an extent .
That seems to be the fatal flaw in the study . So the murder rate does n't suddenly decrease when you are 26 miles away from a gun show . Some people have said that gun shows increase murder in places as far away as Mexico . Simply comparing homicides rates in areas very near gun shows to homicide rates in other areas does n't prove anything .
Which is the more important freedom- freedom from government control of guns or freedom from gun violence and murder ?
Yeah , I 'm scared Milo , I 'm scared that a rational , apparently intelligent person can read these passages and come to the conclusions that you do .
This post was pure projection of the faults of creationists onto evolutionists . Evolution works out in science . Creationists do n't do science but engage in politics .
I say more power to them . These guys issued trash mortgages , put them in tranched securities that they sold as AAA , then took out CDS paper on them ( betting against them ) even though they no longer owned them . Then they went to the government for a massive bailout when the paper they had not yet managed to dump screwed them , and the bailout is still going on via the feds ridiculously low rates . Today they are borrowing hundreds of billions of dollars from the Fed at basically 0 % and tossing it into treasuries at 3.25 % . Do that `` big '' enough and you are talking real money ... and they are doing it big time . I am sure it probably offends some of the truly stupid that there are now groups and individuals out there who do not feel that their responsibility ends at 5:00 on friday , and that they cant do these things without any kind of recourse outside the office . Bureaucracy is a wonderful thing . It allows people to do horrible , immoral things without any personal responsibility , as long as the public is retarded enough to let them do it . It appears there may be some americans who are not quite that retarded .
I am for notification on other medical procedures , however abortion is different . There are many parents out there who are more immature than their daughters , and are abusive . Parental consent is not as much about a parent 's right to know a it is keeping young women out of harms way . Unfortunately , not all minors are as mature as I , and not all parents are as good as mine , and therefore it would be dangerous to pregnant adolescents to subject them to this kind of potential harm , as AO mentioned .
Off course if it goes the other way American children can kiss the chance of getting a proper education in science goodbye .
Funny how the truth so often tends to have an anti-Christian bias . If you can find something untrue in the article , point it out and proffer your evidence ; otherwise ...

( That 's right , folks : you ca n't put JPS on your ignore lists , 'cuz he 's a `` moderator . '' You know , like Glen Beck on `` fair and balanced '' Fox News . )

This post contains a perfectly simple explanation of why ToE is a sham along with a challenge to any Darwinist to prove me wrong . ToE is constructed on a fraud premise . This premise says that the fundamental unit of evolution is the gene . Whenever an evolutionist talks about evolution hes not talking about mere phenotypic change  hes talking about changes in genes . To a Darwinist , just because an animal changes phentoypically , or even if he passes these changes down to progeny does not mean that evolution has occurred . A fish could morph into a human , but if there are no changes in genes then this would not be considered `` evolution . '' The only way evolution can happen , by their own definition , is if there is a change in genetics . This premise , I suggest is a complete and total fraud ... and I will explain why now : Lets take humans and dogs , for example . When compared side-by-side , sure enough , humans may have an assortment of genes that dogs do not  and possibly the other way around . But just because humans may have certain genes that dogs do n't , does not mean that these genes cause the difference between humans and dogs . Of course , there are no dog genes or human genes. But likewise there are no tongue genes ,  tail genes or toenail genes. Parts are not translated genes . Thus , the assertion that new genes got created or that individual genes mutated over time to chnage one kind of animal into another is blatantly false and physically impossible . But it 's worse than that . As I said before , humans have a whole slew of genes  theoretically , at least -- that dogs ( or other animals ) dont have . But evolutionists still contend that these genetic differences cause the difference between the organisms ! Thats why they analyze DNA with such scrutiny ! But did it ever dawn on them that studying genetics is a compete waste of time because of the real possibility that each dog or each human has the genes they have because of what they are ? Scientists have been telling us for decades that who or what we are is determined by what genes we have ... But theyve got it backwards ! Instead , we have the genes we have because of who we are . A dog is n't a dog because he barks ; a dog barks because of what he is . Same with genes . This , of course , spells destructin to ToE because it means genetic evolution is a fraud . Evolution , thus , should not be a theory based on changes in genes , but a theory based on changes in traits . But scientists continue to mess around with genes and try to make the body do weird things by mutating them . They simply wont give up because theyve seen correlations between gene activity and various physiological responses . But heres where theyre screwing everything up : When you were a kid did you ever stand on your head ? If so , did your face ever get red if you stayed upside down for a period of time ? If so , do you admit that it was the act of being upside down that caused the blood to rush to your head ? Or , do you have the audacity to claim that you were upside down because your face was red ? Thats excactly what science is doing with genetics : theyve got the audacity to claim that changes in genes ( the red face ) is causing the organsim to change physiologically ( go upside down . ) In reality , whats happening is the organism is experiencing a new environment ( turning upside down ) and then the genes are responding in kind ( turning red ) . The only way you can prove this logic wrong is to do one of two things : 1 ) show me conclusively that mutations happen completely randomly and unoriented to environmental pressures . 2 ) show me that the same environmental pressures on genes will not produce the exact same physiological effects over and over and over . So there it is . Go for it .

All of these quotes refer to interracial marriage , views of race , and the proper interaction between the races . They date from 1823-1964 and were culled by reporter Eric Zorn from a Boston University Law Review article and a brief filed with the U.S. Supreme Court . Zorns article was published in the Chicago Tribune , May 19 , 1996
Pro-choice supporters tend not to think in terms of moral proclamations , so proclamations such as `` All human life is sacred '' mean little to them if not more fully supported by rational arguement .
If evolution occurs to all life forms , there could be no life forms today which have not evolved , because all life would be in transition .
So men can marry men , and women can marry women .
You are assuming that God ( if there is one ) is not somehow sustaining His creation . Once again , this can not be proven nor disproven by science as it can not be tested or observed - as you said in your original topic starting post . But it is reasonable to believe , that if there is a God who created the whole universe , then without Him sustaining it somehow , it would cease to exist - hence , since it does exist , it is logical to believe that He is somehow sustaining it ( obviously not as much as He can ) . So , if true , the observations that we see and/or take , are the effects of God acting on His creation ; and miracles can be explained in such a way to say that it is God just acting on a part of His creation in a different way , this is not only plausible but logical .
as for the proof , its really not a proof at all . if God is defined as a perfect being in reality , that does not mean that God exists . if i define a ufo as a flying spacecraft from another planet in reality , that does not make such things exist . its just a definition . i really dont see how that can be even considered a proof basically , the definition : `` a being possessing every perfection and every positive attribute '' is not a true definition , because both perfection and positive attributes are subjective . so theres really nothing to work with here God , by this definition , doesnt exist

OK , first off , this thread is for people who are either partially convinced about the existence of God , or have some problem with the nature of God as they understand it . this is not a thread where evidence is needed , just opinions and personal persuasions . if you believe God exists or have absolutely no doubt that God exists , then you can contribute , but its not the intention of this thread to prove that God exists or not . its just to explore the reasons why people believe or doubt whatever about God
The discussion really got blown out of proportion somewhere along the line . I just had a problem with justifying abortion with false terms . It seemed more than obvious to me to use the meaning of words that is common in the English langauge . This is obviously the purpose of a dictionary and thus that is what I try to reasonably use in a discussion .

I 've given yout a way to control crime and violence . At the same time not trample on the Constitution . The Constitution is a very noble document . Please stop trying to trash it . I 've given you a way to have Constitutional and voluntary gun control on airlines . Yet you keep insisting it must be a manditory law . Minditory = no right to choose . Unconstitutional . Bottom line . My way tamples on no ones rights . Your way the rights of good citizens get trashed . Both ways reduce crime and violence . Your way does not adress root cause . Mine does . Please try and maintain the principle : `` Enact no laws or regulations that affect , change , or modify the behavior of good citizens '' . Then get back to me .

Having asserted that transitional fossils abound , Isaak ( a widely known evolutionist ) proceeds to cite Archaeopteryx
my my you are up on the current events . Thanks for shedding light on this for everyone here .
If every creature in the population changes its phenotype at the same time in response to an evironmental cue ( diet , temperature , predators , etc ) , this could give the illusion of evolution -- or change -- in the fossil record .
from a religious perspective , knowledge of God can only come through faith .
What you did was use unfounded generalizations , which is exactly the sort of thing this thread is about .
So what rational reason would there be to deny them the right to marry the person they love ?
The thing is , though , god and humans are n't the only candidates . Mach illustrated this point in the first post . Ogres , vampires , ghosts , etc . are all other possible candidates . That said , change `` God '' to `` ogres '' and the argument proves the existence of ogres .

Maybe someone already said this but , problem is , we cant let the government take away any of our rights . Once they start doing that it would set precedence and who knows were it would end . Personally I wouldnt own a gun for self defense because I am just not that big of a sissy .
On Wednesday , April 28 , the Assembly Appropriations Committee met to consider Assembly Bill 1810 and Assembly Bill 2223 . AB1810 was placed into the suspense file due to financial costs and will be reconsidered in the near future . This bill may be acted upon at a later date . Please continue checking your email and NRA-ILA : : for any updates on AB1810 . AB2223 was re-scheduled for next week . AB1810 would establish a registration system , similar to the one currently in place for handguns , for all newly-acquired long guns . Under AB1810 , the make , model and serial number of the firearm as well as the identifying information of the purchaser would be recorded and kept on file by the California Attorney Generals office . If AB1810 were enacted , violent criminals would continue doing what they do now  obtain firearms through illegal means . This bill would not decrease crime but will rather have disastrous effects on the already financially unstable Golden State . AB1810 would impose additional burdens on Californias taxpayers to maintain the registration system as well as on the states licensed firearms dealers , small businesses who already deal with extensive business requirements . One simply needs to look at Canada , a nation with draconian firearms registration , to see the results  billions in cumulative administrative costs , annual cost overruns , no clear substantiation of public safety benefits , unjust prosecution , and a bureaucratic complexity that daunts those willing to comply . Ironically , California is considering a new registration scheme as Canada is considering doing away with its system .
Those who support gun control will agitate for more restrictions on availability of guns . Those who interpret the second ammendment as an obligation will argue that more guns will solve the problem . Those who see it as an issue in itself , with the firearms as a secondary factor will be ignored or belittled by the other two groups .

I 've asked this question and many others you may see me post , in a number of other forums . I 've recieved similar arguments , about a country not deciding to invade us . No Particular country was ever mentioned , However , if possible , I would like to belatedly clarify that I am asking this question in the context of the time we are now living in , as opposed to any other time . ( I 'm not sure if I made that at all clear in the post that started the thread . ) ( I take it that this question has been asked before in this forum , rather recently , I assume ? ? ? If not in an initial thread post , then perhaps within another thread . )
Furthmore - whether an individual deserves rights should NEVER be a voting matter . What an utterly disgusting concept .
The link between the current understanding of subsurface hydrology and evolution concerns the age of the water at a given point in a confined aquifer . The water in some confined aquifers is in the order of millions of years old , which is known due to the fact that gravity can only pull so much water from the exposed part of the formation for a given length through rocks of varying transmissivity . This means that technically any fossils in such a rock with water at a given age must be older than the water in the rock , which would provide a minimum age for the fossil .
Yes , I do .
In fact , scholars ( even non-Christian ) have brought back some of the Gospels to less than 7 or 8 years after Christ .
Sartre , you know little of history . Until relatively recently within the history of humankind , the Romans adhered to the rule of paterfamilia in which the supreme patriarch of a clan -- oh , how they loved their males , men were next to God in their eyes , a tradition which lives on within the Roman Catholic Church -- ruled on the existence of infants within his clan . If he chose , this next to God male , the infant lived and received shelter and nurturance . If he chose not , the child was abandoned to sate the hunger of wild animals or , perhaps , might be saved by a kindly human wayfarer . In many cases these wayfarers were not so kind and the child may have been severely abused , used as a sexual toy -- hmmm , kind of reminds me of the situation for inner city children in very Roman Catholic Brazil . Interesting .

I 'm not sure I believe that slippery slope . Certainly moral relativism ( sp ? ) is a popular view right now , but I doubt we 'll be doing away with the constitution any time soon . All the hub-bub with abortion is establishing a point at which to entitle rights , not if to give them . I believe birth is a logical place , seeing as how conception is not always known and it 's hard to apply laws retroactivly , especially if the woman did n't know she was pregnant . The citizenship nightmare that will follow , since if it is entitled to constitutional protection then it must be a citizen right ? What happens to the 1/3 of pregnancies that end in spontaneous abortion naturally anyway ? These questions would be too hard for the law to answer to everyone 's satisfaction , even disregarding the whole woman 's rights issue ( which most of the nation would fight tooth and nail for anyway ) .

Catholics have a different belief . The goal is to always save both mother and child . If the fetus dies during the attempt to save both , then that 's what happens . For instance , with an ectopic pregnancy , the goal is n't to kill he fetus , the goal is to save both mother and fetus .
lol , zenodotus . You can *sigh* all you want , you are not debating honestly . Whether or not an abortion is performed , at a certain point in a pregnancy there are no brain functions because no brain is developed . So my point stands .
No disagreements . Something left out ( probably because it was assumed ) , is memory . What you call mental existence I would say is a description of what causes or leads to personal identity . To me it is self evident that there is no person or personhood without a personal identity . There might be disagreement about what the particulars are concerning how to identify a personal identity , but it seems self evident to me that a mind is required , and without a brain , there is no mind , so a brain is required . It seems to me self evident that if there is no brain , there is no person . Of course , others will disagree . Some say that the unique DNA of a zygote is enough for personal identity , but if this is true , identical twins ( with identical DNA ) would have to share one personal identity , and one soul . In the case of a chimera , two souls/unique DNA in two zygotes , would have to blend into one person/soul . ( No , most chimeras are not schizophrenic ) . I believe an integral part of [ personal identity > mental existence > personhood ] is memory . Whether it is short term , or long term , without memory there is no sense of self . ( I may be stating the obvious , but you never know . ) ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ It is not clear if your list of indicators for mental existence is one will suffice , or several are required . I dont think it matters all that much , but Im not sure , just wondering .
They are n't the same . the point is that a group that is fraught with immoral behavior has no crediblity or authority when it comes to dictating what people should or should not do on the basis of morality . Consider it this way : Bill Clinton speaking about how a boyfriend should act in accordance to fideilty . No one is going to believe him because has squandered all of his crediblitiy and authority . It 's the same way with the Catholic Church .

It 's all very interesting , but you left out a critical piece of information . You deliberately omitted the fact that most of the black victims were killed by fellow blacks . These were n't murders carried out by racist white guys , they 're the examples of black on black violence .
Does anyone know a pregnant woman who has `` demanded '' an abortion ? Why is this horrificly false phrase bandied about so carelessly and freely ? It shows a grave disrespect for women who are making painful , soul-searching decisions about pregnancy . Why this great disrespect for women in this position ?
Evolution may not , but most evolutionists do .
Explain to me how copying something is creating something new .
Last time I checked most state boards merely set the guidelines , whether or not they are followed is something entirely different . Still the fact that you have a board of education spouting such ridiculousness is pretty damn amusing .
Most state constitutions that I have looked at expressly protect the right of the ballot initiative . We are , of course , limiting ourselves to state laws since the federal government has absolutely nothing to do with marriage .
If you mean by literal creationism the account of it in the Bible , then no . If evolution did not occur there had to be a spontaneous `` creation '' of life . I ca n't see a natural way for that to occur considering how complex life is .
ur definition of evolution is incorrect . if u go to any dictionary who would find that evolution by definition is a process of simple , basic things evolving or changing into complex structures in laymens term i guess [ ex . society , religion , government and language ] . what u seem to be defining is biological evolution . as for creationism ... I havent decided how i should define it . is it religion , science , idea , theory , or bs . there r many defintions . creationism use so many kinds of definition that there is no point 2 define it ... that and i have no idea . all the dictionary i 've seen r different and bias I 'm just trying to correct . sorry if i had offended u. btw colcletus next time u should be more specific , but i assume u meant biological evolution . oh yeah sorry if my definition sucks . i was in a hurry .
# There were 7,387 black homicide victims in the United States .

How were they able to get an `` aggravated assault '' charge pinned on you ? I 'm assuming she never had a mark on herself to show the cops . Had you two had a previous domestic call history with the police ? Hopefully justice will be served when you get your day in court . Then you 'll get to experience the wonder that is `` family court '' , if you have n't already . You have my sympathies .
Everything on Earth follows a logical , sensible , and rational order , and I think that it is in this order that God rules and for him to break it would be to break his own laws . the laws he gave this Earth .

ADF : NH gov 's proposed revisions to marriage redefinition bill fail religious freedom test - Alliance Defense Fund - Defending Our First Liberty And there it is ... The repeated demand from the anti-gay for SPECIAL PRIVILEGES for the `` religious '' detractors . I fully support CHURCHES and PASTORS from being exempt , but it 's not necessary . Currently , our RELIGIOUS discrimination protection is much stronger than our gay discrimination protection , but do you see churches being forced to perform inter-religion marriage if the church doctrine is against it ? NO ! Do you see atheists saying `` I like the look of this church . I do n't belong , but I 'm going to force you to rent the church for my wedding party anyways . '' ? ? NO ! The existing language and constitutional protections are good enough . But when given more explicit ( redundant ) wording , what do the anti-gay marriage organizations demand ? Something NO GROUP HAS EVER HAD before . They want BUSINESS OWNERS to be free to discriminate if they have `` religious objections '' ... What if their objections are NON-religious in nature ? Why is the religion supposed to get the special perk ? ? ? And as mentioned , NO GROUP HAS EVER HAD this . There were plenty of religious interpretations against black equality and interracial marriage . But did we give THEM special privilege to ignore and discriminate against interracial marriages ? NO ! The really refreshing part of all this ? These whiny temper tantrums just do n't matter ... If the NH legislature includes the religious exceptions ( if they are just reconfirming that churches / pastors do n't have to perform ceremonies they do n't want to ) , then the governor WILL sign it .

Shooter , so a cop is reporting to the scene and there you are packing a gun . How is the cop to know you 're not the shooter ?
Fight back , by all means - when necessary . But if you can legally buy a gun for that purpose , it means that your attacker is that much more likely to be armed as well . That 's a scenario you do n't want to encounter - especially if you do n't happen to be carrying your weapon at the time .
I 've also been explained how random mutations get selected , which supposedly leads to evolution . I do n't buy that either .
I could say the same about heteros . If I have to accept heteros then heteros need to accept me . I just spent 3 hours on a train from Chicago behind a hetero couple ( talk about the hetero lifestyle being in my face ) that could keep their tongues to themselves . I was really sickened by the display of heterosexuality . The boy was cute and I kept thinking what a waste .
How can you tell the difference ?
[ to supersport ] Your clumsy bait and switch was beginning a discussion about evolution and then trying to represent the seasonal change in color of foxes as evolution .
Finally..we have the biggest error of all . I 've bolded the part that destroys everything .
There is one shred , that life exists . There is not a shred of evidence that life came into being by only natural processes .
And now the verse of the day : A man who remains stiff-necked after many rebukes will suddenly be destroyed -- without remedy . - Proverbs 29:1
They used to keel over regularly before modern medicine and my wife has been on medication for a thyroid condition ever since she delivered . `` During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , between 1 percent and 1.5 percent of all births ended in the mother 's death as a result of exhaustion , dehydration , infection , hemorrhage , or convulsions . Since the typical mother gave birth to between five and eight children , her lifetime chances of dying in childbirth ran as high as 1 in 8 . This meant that if a woman had eight female friends , it was likely that one might die in childbirth . ''
I habe absolutely NO patience for those who would impose the nine month rape . To hell I would ever pay in time , money , or lifestyle changes to support the baby of a rapist in my womb . I exist here and my body is not up for grabs . Thems the breaks no matter what laws are in place .
Certain elements decay at a known standard rate , measurung the amount of the decay can tell them how long that element/rock ( and whatever is in it has been there ) .
Not in this instance , no . It isnt trying to parallel pregnancy per se ( though it is most relevant for us if we take it as only 9 months ) , but trying to parallel the moral scenario of having a person attached to you against your will and without your consent . If the pro-life mantra is to be believed , it is never correct to disconnect someone if they will die if you do . So , the argument is applicable for 9 days , 9 months , 9 years or forever .
Ok . But they have handcuffs on and are in a straitjacket . They are required by law to make certain assumptions that do n't pass a straight-face test . They 're required by law to assume that Congress is going to do everything they say they 're going to do despite the fact that there 's clear and compelling evidence that they never have and they probably never will in certain regards . For example , you know , cutting provider reimbursements dramatically . Well , all right , do n't hold your breath . And so the fact is , I think , technically the numbers add up to say it will reduce the deficit over ten years and even beyond that . I think based on realistic assumptions , no way .

What if you kill them before they kill you ? Good luck arguing to that one !
And primarily American evangelical protestants at that , but that 's a mouthful . What I 'm asking really is that given they 're promoting Jewish scripture , why are they ignoring Jewish interpretation ? It just seems bizare .
Now , it 's RNA that seems to be `` running the show . ''
Then explain to me why a pregnant woman was hit by a car not long ago leading to the death of both mother and baby . Resulting in a double vehicular homicide charge being leveled against the driver ? How can that be if the unborn child does n't have rights as a human being ? And why could the mother have aborted that baby legally if she chose to ? Is n't that a true catch 22 for the unborn , and a contradiction in the law ?
First of all , why are you reffering to my arguments as `` bullets '' ?
Too late . It 's already been done . One thing I learned a while back is that a conservative will rarely , if ever , post anything that is contrary to his or her beliefs and the same can be said for the liberal . Both sides take every advantage to post something favorable to their ideologies . There is no such thing as being unbiased when it comes to putting out the info . People in glass houses should not throw rocks . No side of the aisle is above this tactic . Including my own . Do n't believe anything you hear or read and only half of the stuff you actually see for yourself .
This 'person ' concept also amazes me . A foetus is a stage in human development , something that begins at conception . It possesses unique DNA . But , rather than address it as human , we call it `` person '' on not a person . I too have little problems with 1st trimester and early 2nd abortions but do n't like to get into quibbling over defining what a person is as I see slippery slope arguements in it .
oh brother.. so what if a minority of americans wanted to legalize murder . this is rediculous .

Creationism means religion , but it also involves a belief in the authenticity of historical documents that have been meticulously preserved over thousands of years . That 's not just religion , it 's secular , observed history - something evolution does n't have .
First , are you not forcing your beliefs on me when you lobby for , enact , and support a law that legalizes an act that I see as murder ?
There happens to be no scientist who is taken serious who discards the the global flood ,
I 'm developing a theory about communication ... the form of communication requiring the least thinking ( for yourself ? ) is insult . What do you guys think ?
Depends on which cell you mean . Mammalian red blood cells , for example , have had their entire nuclei and mitochondria removed . Not so much as a smidgeon of DNA .
I only looked at what YOU had to say . It concerned mocking .
Or another example of how denying homosexuals access access to anything but the same legal institutions as heterosexuals will never result in equality . The domestic partner registry just is n't sufficient ; why would anyone think that creating a similar marriage-substitute will be equal ?
Because the article mentioned quite a bit about the observations that he was conducting . These are very important in the scientific method .
I have to show you . If you that the holocaust happened then I can show you how creationist style tactics demand you mention alternatives to the idea tha the holocaust happened in the name of truth .
You are joking right ?
The 2010 US Census will now include married gay couples . The Census Bureau have announced that married gay and lesbian couples would be counted in the 2010 national tally , previously barred in several states by the 1996 law DOMA , which defines marriage as a heterosexual union for federal agencies . `` They will be counted , and they ought to report the way they see themselves , '' says Steve Jots , spokesman for the Census Bureau . `` In the normal process of reports coming out after the census of 2010 , I think the country will have a good data set on which to discuss this phenomenon that is evolving in this country . '' `` This is about folks ' identity , '' Jost added . `` We are experienced in dealing with changing social phenomena and how to measure and report it , and we want to get it right . ''
People do not like to be cheated . They do not like to be victims of fraud . If economic systems are not governed and regulated , people can be victimized by the systems .
Test hypothesis : ( of course , all of the hundreds of complex studies known to prove evolution , most have been verified ) .
It 's a result of Dr. Pepper , Cheetos , microwave popcorn , macaroni and cheese , hot dogs , pretzels , gum drops , high fructose corn syrup , flavors , colorings , transfats etc etc etc ... ... . And its getting worse fast genetic damage is accumulating in society . The medical establishment is not doing us any favors , either , by merely treating the symptoms .
Aikido , judo and karate wado ryu would constitute a good combination .
... to ToE because it means genetic evolution is a fraud . Evolution , thus , should not be a theory based on changes in genes , but a theory based on changes in traits .
Why in the name of god would you discuss acceptable reasons for domestic ownership of guns in a conference about curtailing illegal international gun trafficking ? The two are entirely unrelated . I seldom hear of people discussing the benifits of marriage during rape prevention seminars . While the two are concievably related , they are entirely seperate topics .
Even better were does it say that evolution is proven ?
I wonder if those who would use abortion to euthanize certain babies would also support euthanization of others who live outside of the womb .
I disagree with your decision . It would have been better if you sucked it up and kept the kid . Even if you ended up on the street at least you would n't have killed anyone . I dont mean to be judgemental , and I 'm not calling you a bad person , but what you did was wrong .
Your question , which has been pointed out already , has a theological basis - God is supposed to have given us dominion over the rest of creation etc . But what separates us from other mammals ( if we restrict the question to that class of vertebrates ) is reckoned to be `` self consciousness '' - the human mind that can deliberate upon and analyse its own thought processes .
What if the jury is wrong ?
I 've been telling this board for months that the gene is not the player in biological change that everyone thinks it is .
Problem is that the right to marry is not a clear constitutional right . It is a right that has been interpreted by Courts on an illegitimate legal theory known as substantive due process .
Marriage is to promote children bearing and making a family unit .
Ridiculously wrong . A catapillar grows into a butterfly . A pup grows to a dog . A womb-trapped child grows into an adult human . They grow and develop and change .
I have laid down some conditions before I give up my guns . They are not going to happen . There is no way I see within my life , that the 2nd Amendment will be repealled . There is no way that the National Guard will become `` militia-ized '' in my life time .
Oh I do n't doubt the medical establishment talks the talk occasionally , they just do n't walk the walk . They do n't treat their patients with a method that corresponds to those things you just mentioned .
Come on JP really . So what happens when opportunity is not equal ? What is the point of doing anything to solve a problem if there is a disregard for achieving measurable results . The whole point of creating an equal opportunity is to correct an imbalance . What type of results , if any , would be acceptable ? I did n't say the government is always right or the intended goals are always achieved . That is our fault for putting people in government with the intelligence of carpet and then allowing them to stay .

let 's take a look at a non-biblical God , then . if such a God exists , what is his definition . can he interact with the physical realm ?
I agree with you -- there is a definite need to meet the needs of gay people as well as married people . We need to find ways to meet everyone 's need regardless . But this is n't a marriage issue , it 's a issue of meeting people 's needs regardless of marital status . IOW , the bottom line is that marriage should n't even be a prerequisite for people getting aid in such a case as this . In such awful tragedy , it should n't matter whether someone is marred or not .
For instance , highly successful modern methods of phylogenetic inference assume such a dependence implicitly when they implement different rates for transition and transversion changes . Likewise , for two decades , developmental evolutionists have been emphasizing the importance of developmental `` constraints '' that influence course of evolution via their effects on the generation of variation . Thus , while there are clearly common threads linking past and present thought in evolutionary biology , the evolutionary theory of today is not that of Darwin , nor even that of Darwin 's mid-20th-century successors .
In a similar fashion , we have many conflicting evidences that we are still supposed to accept ... se my post with regard to the different and conflicting schools of thought about the ascent of man . You said ... '' I 'll throw in a personal question . Would you be willing to accept evolution as truth if you seen tomorrow that a dog which walked on two legs and had wings and could fly was born of your neighbors dog ? '' Why would such an event necessarily point to evolution ? How do you know that my neighbour is n't part of a great secret plant that has designed a dog with cyber-enhancements ? Or what about if it was an alien speices of dog that assumed dog-like characteristics to blend in with human society .
You are the affirmative so it is up to you to prove that Intelligent Design should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution . So far you have shown that it 's an interesting idea , that may in the future lead to some good things . But you have failed to prove that it is in any way even close to the theory of evolution .
I agree as well . Urban Hot Islands are not a big deal . Of course they will be warmer ( more energy , lighting , etc ) but that does not mean the Earth will suffer catastrophic climate change.. only in movies .

The deceived one is you Brady . How many of those alleged lives taken by gun violence were police shootings ? How many by gang memebrs killing other gang members ? Where did you come up with your figures Brady , VPC your namesake group ? They are thoroughly discredited as you should realize by now . How many are suicides ? The prevention models for these are different in case you were unaware . You fail to even consider how many of those lives were taken by criminals in the commission of a crime . Yet you would render us helpless to them in your quest for a non hostile working environment . Show exactly where in the constitution and Bill of Rights the wording for gun control . Here is a clue , they are n't there . If you were truely concerned about loss of innocent life then you would be supporting laws to keep the violent criminal away from society . Instead they are free after many arrests and convictions to prey upon a society that you would render helpless . Why Brady ?
Whoa , whoa ... I NEVER said fundamental Christianity and evolution could co-exist , I have no idea where you got that . I said Christianity and evolution could co-exist . Fundamentalists believe that everything in the Bible should be taken literally , and obviously that wo n't work with evolution . Christianity and evolution , however , work out just fine .
What 's the scoop here ?
If anyone else shows an interest , we 'll go from there .
In reality science doesnt argue that intelligent design can not be true , it simply argues that it is not true as far as it has researched and beyond that science doesnt try to blindly guess from the infinite possibilities .
I 'm confused by this one . You did n't say in the original statement that the boyfriend had anything to do with it . So how would doing `` the right thing '' involve him .
Peeling , with all due respect , we have allegedly had 4 billion years of evolution on Earth since the first simple life supposedly appeared . Why must we make more assumptions based on what will happen in the next 10,000 years ?
I 'm really curious to see who beleives in god for concrete reasons and who beleives in him by faith .
In theory the preventative care provided would allow us to catch conditions sooner , resulting in decreased utilization of hospitals , specialists , and equipment .

( Speaking of the so called Assault Weapons ) Local firearms dealers said they havent been able to keep that type of firearm on the shelves for months . Scott Hoffman said that since November he hasnt been able to immediately fill orders for items considered personal weapons . Hes back-ordered in certain kinds of ammunition , too . Gun sales have at least doubled ,  said the longtime owner of Hoffmans Gun Center on the Berlin Turnpike . Business is up at least 50 percent and thats in a bad economy . It shows you how scared people are. cross town at the Newington Gun Exchange , business is equally brisk . In the past six months , Any type of military-style firearm has been selling well ,  Lenk said . Weve been lucky to have any to put on the wall . The rush of first-time gun owners has tripled in some places , leaving local and state police struggling to process the overflow of pistol-permit applications . Gun salesmen like Lenk and Hoffman are attributing the boost in sales to a collision of political and economic forces . Lenk said business started picking up when it became apparent that Barack Obama , who is perceived as promoting tighter gun restrictions , might win the election . At the same time , as the economy soured , fears of increased crime created a boom in a business that has traditionally been steady but not necessarily given to dramatic spikes . Traditionally when the economy is bad , crime goes up ,  Hoffman said . Add to that , that everyone who is in charge of our government doesnt want us to have guns , and guns sales have at least doubled.
It failed so it proves you and others wrong . Ultimately , the efforts of the Jewish resistance fighters proved insufficient against the German forces . The Germans eventually committed an average daily force of 2,090 well-armed troops , including 821 Waffen-SS Panzergrenadier troops ( consisting of five SS reserve and training battalions and one SS cavalry reserve and training battalion ) , as well as 363 Polish Blue Policemen , who were ordered by the Germans to cordon the walls of the Ghetto .

Yeah , there are those who scream that self-defence is not a valid reason for gun ownership . There were no valid reasons until the libs thought them up , but I 'll set that aside for now . The question here is wether or not you think hunting is a valid reason for gun ownership . I do n't forsee any stats posted , as this thread has nothing to do with crime . So this is a chance for you to work on debating skills .
Nine months of discomfort is nothing compared to life in prison for voluntary manslaughter !
Biologists now know that individual animals in a population are able to develop specific traits while still in the egg or womb .
Of course , liberals should also all favor drugs , alcohol , prostitution , gambling , polygamy , and open marriage , since all of these are moral-based laws as well .

Umm ... thats the point of saying God of the Gaps - when science fills in the gaps then there is less for your God to do . This is just pure intentional ignorance - you do realise Peddlar , that things can happen over time ? Not to mention that evolutionary hypothesis have been made and then tested - protein homology for one , there is no way anyone knew the answer before hand but what was observed later when technology improved is what was expected . DNA dating pretty much gives the same time for common ancestors as fossils do . There is really no difference between carrying out an experiment a fraction of a second in the past and observing it than millions of years - other than the latter makes it a little difficult to get all the evidence sometime . Science is the current sum of human knowledge about how the world works . Never get published though There is a massive amount of evidence that points to things being designed via evolution rather than a concious designer - there are massive amount of badly designed organs and organisms , either God is spiteful or incompetant . Lets not go into the parasitic wasps and hyperparasitic wasps which are what made Darwin convert ( or part of it ) . He could n't beleive that a kind benevolent creator would design such horrors intentionally . Having something 's larvae consume your organs whilst still alive and feeding of another catapilar 's guts whilst still inside them strikes you as a kind and good thing to do ?
Regarding the stars , I have a thought . We measure the distance of stars in light years , then try to predict their age . Perhaps when measuring the distance , that 's all we get is distance- not actual `` time '' , or age . If this were true it would explain the difference between the `` old '' and `` new '' earth theory .
Actually , with more data that changes the number of assumptions required , it is possible to reach a greater degree of certainty about something . The greater degree of certainty you reach , the better you will be able to apply your findings .
Here 's an interesting hypothetical situation that I came across recently . It 's one of those Catch-22 , you can only save one things . Say you are in a fertility clinic and it 's burning down . Over in the corner there is a 2 year old child crying . In the other corner is a petri dish ( or test tubes if you like ) with 5 blastula embryos in it . You can only save one . Do you save the 2 year old child or do you save the 5 lives in the petri dish ? And this brings up the point of why is it that there are protesters outside abortion clinics that abort pregnancies but there are never protesters outside of fertility clinics where millions MORE embryos are destroyed than ever will be destroyed in abortion clinics ? What gives with that ? The fertility clinics are still `` killing babies '' are n't they ? Why are there so many protesters outside abortion clinics and none outside fertility clinics ?
You can deny it all you want -- and I 'm sure you will because you have completely brainwashed yourself .
Certainly science has provided part of the answer with their finding of the Mitachondrial `` Eve '' , suggesting that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human populations .
What would be the legal precedent to stop non-Indians from performing or receiving abortions on sovereign lands ?
you may , but firstly , that argument may well not fly - much of the grain going to these animals is essentially the trash left over from other production to begin with , unfit for human consumption .
The thing I do n't like about abortion is that it is the willful and intentional killing of an innocent human being . If abortion does n't kill a human life , as you suggest above , then there is really no ground for opposing it . For instance , so what if it is being used as a backup contraception plan ? So what if it is only being used to get revenge on a loved one ? So what if it is only being used as a controlling factor ?
I will give a brief stab at giving positive evidence .

Biotech is one of the up and coming industries . Whichever country dominates the field will have a huge advantage in the coming years . Evolution is one of the corner stones of biology . This is all blatantly obvious . The only thing `` interesting '' , and that mostly from a psychological point of view , is your stand that this is n't obviously true .
Alright , I 'll accept your term of punish . If you did n't fully understand what I was trying to say in my last post , here is a quick run down of it . Abortion = Punish Child If God is good he would n't punish an aborted child Therefore an aborted child will go to heaven If this were not true then God would be punishing the child .

Who was it that said `` Americans will tolerate anything so long as it does not disrupt traffic '' ? If it was simply a question of putting one abortion clinic out of operation , then yes , protesting wya from that clinic would be inappropriate . That is nto what we are talkling about here , though . They are protesting abortion as an institution . With that being the case , restricting their protest to that clinic would be inappropriate . I take it you found the pictures disturbing ? That is pretty much the point . People genberally have a lot of trouble getting their heads around things like abortion , war , etc.. I had a dinner party not long ago and invited an army buddy of mine who hapened to be in the area . After dinner , there was a `` loud conversation '' between my army buddy , a staunch conservative , and a guy who was pro bush ( which pretty much makes you automatically NOT a staunch conservative ) . They were arguing about the Iraq war . My army buddy , who just served a hitch in Iraq , pulled out a stack of photos when the guy started parroting the bush administrations line about helping the iraqi people . They were photos of civilians , mostly little kids , who were blown apart by US troops . My friend had taken them in Iraq , then mailed them while he was on leave because the US ARmy does NOT allow you to go home with pictures like that ( another of those new secret policies ) . The pro-war guy ran out the back door and puked on my lawn . When he came back in , I jokingly said `` so did he change your mind , Chuck '' . to which my buddy replied `` I think he just changed my entire life , political affiliations , and religon in 30 seconds '' . Someitmes that is what it takes for people to sit up and take notice , especially when you are talking deaths or body counts .
They both like to indoctrinate the young . That was the point .
it ought but it wo n't , at least not the gun fetishists in this forum
Thats why today , after what happened to George Tiller , I know that the only thing that will assuage my personal grief over his shocking loss is for leaders across our nation to join me in expressing outrage at this heinous crime , this domestic terrorism . And yes , they need to call it out in exactly those terms . Thats what it is . I want to hear massive outrage on the part of the community . I want it to start with President Obama . His statement today is a good beginning . But thats not nearly enough . He must immediately outline an action plan to increase federal protection for providers and clinics and call for stringent enforcement of the Federal Access to Clinic Entrances Act . He has an opportunity to make a speech that addresses womens moral right to reproductive self-determination as passionately as his brilliant speech about race did during the primary . He can and should lead the nation to a larger and more productive conversation about the complex choices women make , and why women deserve the respect , equality and justice inherent in the right to choose to have , or not have , a child . He should bring together pro-choice and anti-choice leaders and get them to issue a joint statement decrying Tillers murder as well as all such violent opposition to one anothers efforts . Now that would be real common ground . ... . The silence overall from leaders so far has been deafening , as attorney and longtime Arizona volunteer for reproductive rights causes Leon Silver pointed out . And if our leaders remain silent , I can tell you with perfect assurance what will happen next . There will be more violence . Dr. Tillers friends , family , patients , colleagues and the many pro-choice activists who have supported him over the years need the vigil in Wichita and those springing up elsewhere to mourn the 67-year-old doctors death and celebrate his exceptional life . The larger community of reproductive health professionals and activists , including those who bravely escort women safely into and out of health facilities for abortions , need to cry and hug and lift one another up on the wings of their convictions that they are doing Gods work , saving womens lives in the fullest sense of the word . I am with them in spirit . But when it comes to changing a culture that has marginalized abortion by shaming women and hounding , even murdering , the doctors and clinic staff who provide safe abortions , when it comes to changing a culture bent on shaming women who are , in all good conscience , making the most moral of personal decisions -- candlelight vigils alone will never be enough .
I hope you dont believe everything that is written in a textbook that has been changed over and over . The Bible never has .
Abortion is murder in countries that define it as murder . It is n't murder in those that do not define it as murder . You seem highly confused over the terms murder and killing . Pouring bleach down a toilet is killing : it kills bacteria . Slaughtering a cow for meat is killing . Murder is an illegal killing of a human . For an abortion to be murder , a country must define the embryo and/ or fetus as a human and must make the killing of that embryo and/ or fetus illegal . As to the idea that we are all glad we were not aborted , this is a nonsense statement . It 's like being glad that my house did n't blow up last night killing me in my sleep before I knew what had happened . On that note , I 'm really glad I did n't suffer a heart attack whilst typing this reply ! We are taking thousands of lives . It 's whether the killing is justified that is important . That is what the whole abortion debate comes down to : does a woman have the right to chose to kill a fetus that is growing within her .
Philosophy is king - not science .
What they are saying is that the fossil record does not show evolution
You dont have to believe rediculous lies to believe that God created the universe . there are some who do fabricate these lies ( I 'm not mentioning satans name ) , and that is why many people dismiss God as a myth . but if you are realistic about it , then it is not at all unreasonable to believe that there is a higher power runnin things .
Aside from the general gay bias demonstrated by the author , the author attempts to make parallels and draw contrasts that dont exist . For example,1 ) if liberals are such strong supporters of equality as a fundamental right why do they promote policies that favor one group over another ? Affirmative Action , graduated income tax , the list goes on and on . 2 ) there is no proof that a persons sexual orientation is determined at birth , so does that mean that liberals have greater faith than conservatives ? 3 ) Of course if you throw out morality as a basis for law , theres no reason , other than economics , to not allow gay marriage . Of course , liberals should also all favor drugs , alcohol , prostitution , gambling , polygamy , and open marriage , since all of these are moral-based laws as well . Come to think of it , if we remove all religious-based laws , why are they pushing for gays to be included in MARRIAGE , one of the most legally oppressive institutions there is ?
The atheist needs to explain how something can exist thats not material , can not be observed , and is absolute .
1. gman , have you ever been pregnant ? 2 . Have you ever been responsible for a child ? A real child ? Not your imaginary children ? 3 . Ever you ever been responsible for a real human being ?
But he said the NRA is also prepared to work with Democrats , as it did in 2007 in the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings , ... .

Even though if it seems like they are n't listening , I think subconsciously , they recognize very well that they are wrong .
So since she does n't come out , we just assume that the four people that they have affidavits from are not lying , or maybe BEING PAID BY THE KERRY CAMPAIGN ?
I believe there should be laws that only trained , licensed , medical professionals conduct abortions . I also would support that late pregnancy abortions only occur if a doctor deems them medically necesary . ( And I mean DOCTOR - not religious leaders or peckerwood politicians - a DOCTOR . )
If all of our experiments show the Earth is 4.5 billion years old , then that is how old it is . If the Bible says something different , then either God meant Genesis for peoples past and now uses scientists to explain things better ( though I am uncomfortable with this idea as many scientists are atheists ) , or our puny minds , compared with God 's , have n't yet worked out how Genesis and an old Earth tie together
Shut up you retarded moronic XXXXX . You little whining baby , stop wasting my time you dumb fool .
What this means is : that we will never figure out the intricate workings of the genome , no matter how much we learn about it .
I am gravely offended by those who claim to be on a first name basis with God , who claim to know exactly what it is that God wants and believes/ To me , somehow , it smacks of self-idolatrization , prideful in being `` next '' to God .
In Genesis , humans are created seperately from all other creatures , but apes and monkeys are not specifically mentioned .
so we would penalize financially those who want to have kids ?
The court followed the idea of not changing the game after it has been played . They changed the law , but they wont undo what had been done before the law change . For example , say the changed the fine for speeding to 10,000 dollars . People who had already been given speeding tickets would not be fined more money . People who were married before prop 8 did so completely legally . The law has been changed , but the act of marrying that they performed was legal at the time it was performed , so it would be wrong to undo that .
i 'm saying , 'according to the dictionary ' may not mean that much . the dictionary is too , what is the word , standard to describe certain things . it says 'killing of a human ' , but what about the vegans ? they believe that killing an animal is murder . words and the meaning of words change over time .
ROFL . They all believe in a god but hope there is n't ?
A position of pro-choice is pro-life because the lives and quality of life of women are valued .
So the main disagreements between fundamentalists and theistic evolutionists are what are , and are not first ( primary ) causes .
Here it goes , as God decided to make the Earth he kept creating various living creatures , improving each new model until he culminated in man with intelligence .
Furthermore , as usual your analysis is ridiculously limited . Arizona and Arkansas , two states with anti-gay measures , voted for McCain electorally . Florida voted for Obama by a margin of 51 % . If we go with some easy/sleazy assumptions for quick math , that means that if about 2 % of those voting for Obama decided they did n't want gay marriage , then the anti-gay marriage initiative would pass .
Nothing at all . You think open carrying of loaded handguns in public will become fashionable in CA ? I think if anyone took to this they 'd find themselves asked to leave establishments routinely . I 'm not against concealed carry in principle but open carry seems silly to me . I smell posers .

What is the `` Scientific Method '' of evolutionary research in contrast to the `` Scientific Method '' of Creation research ?
4Forums is pleased to announce a formal debate between Cerebro and zachvac : Resolved : Intelligent Design should be part of the public schools ' science curriculum , taught as a valid alternative to the Theory of Evolution . Cerebro will argue the affirmative , zachvac the negative . A 5/4 post structure has been agreed upon . Cerebro will begin and end this debate . A time limit of one week will be allowed between each post . The judges for this debate are sinjin , jitobear , and joebrummer . Their decisions are final . Best of luck to Cerebro and zachvac .
Do n't get me wrong . This is n't exactly a trip to Sunday school . You should n't accept packing an arsenal around in the trunk as if it were completely innocuous . It kinda seems suspicious like a primer colored Nissan Maxima with five guys wearing stocking caps sitting in a vacant lot at 3 a.m ... ...
The argument that child labour is necessary in some economies is a strawman , it was used when the unions here forced the changes in working conditions through .
Yes , that is generally the main debate , because the fetus has not done anything to deserve to get aborted .
Since when was having the gov't recognize a marriage a human right ?
Here we go again .
One think I notice about the debate is that Archy seems particularly ignorant of evolution and evolutionary theory . Now he has shown that he is also pretty ignorant of geology .
I think at least part of the reason is that they do n't wear their sexuality on their shoulder and flaunt it . And they do n't seem to live for the purpose of 'gay pride . '
There was nothing wrong with my answer . I did the correction after being insulted , double-standard huh . I am not entitled to my own opinion if it does n't agree with yours . I expected alot more from you , you 've let me down . Your obviously only looking at one side of the argument .
Please . PLEASE , read an introductory Geology or Geography/Geomorphology textbook . Then we 'll talk . Yikes . Waxy
Bad , bad , bad . 1 ) Reducing meat consumption will create a change towards more agricultural farming which is more sustainable for humans and the environment . 1 ) Some , perhaps all `` Livestock feed '' is actually edible for humans ; GM maize is regularly consumed in the US and Mexico . 2 ) One does not have to consume those foods as there are thousands of plant foods that can be eaten .
What about platapuses ? They have a duck 's bill and yet they live mostly underwater .
Abortion is wrong , and it is legal . It is because the United States has turned its back on God . People should want to have babies because if they do n't the eggs will die unfertilized and they could go to Hell . When a woman gets pregnant if she is a good woman she will not kill the baby , because she did the right thing to get pregnant and there is always plenty of ppl who want to adopt babies .
Their beliefs are fanciful . We might as well give credence to Murray the mystical Eeel as having created the earth and the universe . It 's unparsimonious . You do n't need absolute proof for something to be valid . There is no credible proof for creationism , and evolution is the ONLY other viable , parsimonious explanation .
Fear what ever you like , but when you make it public policy even in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence that it is irrational , then is that OK ?
exactly . they 're like the swiss , just ca n't seem to make up their minds I think i 'll sway this way today , wait maybe that way .
Have you got any other articles that would support these baseless claims and wild accusations ? One source is n't good enough for a scientific approach .
Pope Benedict XVI on Tuesday condemned the grave deviations and failures of capitalism exposed by the financial crisis and issued a strong call for a true world political authority to oversee a return to ethics in the global economy ... . His attack on unbridled capitalism and unregulated market forces ... . his plea for financiers in particular to refocus on ethics ... . Pope Benedicts emphasis on the need for forms of redistribution of wealth is also likely to fuel the debate at the summit  to be attended by 39 heads of government and international institutions  over the failure of several rich nations , most notably Italy and France , to honour past aid commitments .
I wasnt familiar with Poes Law either . Heres what I found on it ; Deleted from Wikipedia - Poe 's law ( deleted 15 May 2008 at 06:32 - Deletionpedia ) It lasted 21 days on Wikipedia before being deleted , and it was originated by a Christianforums poster named Nathan Poe . Doesnt really seem like that big of deal to me , but the atheist community seems to be increasingly fascinated with anything at all that allows them to mock Christianity . As this now famous genius Poe puts it ;
I do n't think so . It is my understanding that the Pro-Life side argues that the fetus is not part of the woman 's body ( because it is a separate organism ) and therefore the issue does n't boil down to conservatism vs. liberalism . For example , there are some Libertarians ( i.e . capitalist-liberals ) who argue on the Pro-Life side , not because they want to force morality on people , but because they want to apply anti-murder laws more consistently .
A lot of garbage has been bandied about concerning the emotional trauma a woman suffers after she has had an abortion . There is no substantive , unbiased research on this topic but a cursory sampling seems to indicate that women who report great emotional trauma after an abortion were already mentally unbalanced , possibly subject to depression or dramatic mood swings or other mental disturbances prior to becoming pregnant and having an abortion . I am inclined to believe that such emotionally-disturbed women are incapable of making a rational choice in many instances and they probably would have suffered enormous emotional consequences whatever choice they made . .

society which accepts the idea that the origin of the cosmos could be explained in terms of an explosion , reveals more about the society itself than about the universe .
What predictions can creationism make ? Does belief a creator necessarily imply that such fossils will be found ? If evolution predicts them , and creationism makes no predictions , what will it mean if and when such fossils are found ?
Actually , as Another Opinion pointed out , there are more considerations beyond that . Emotional ones . Some people would have a hard time giving up some part of themselves ( or how ever they see it ) , thus there are the cases of changed minds . Others may constantly worry later on 'how is s/he doing , are they okay or not ... ' in regards to the child . I was merely addressing certain aspects of this topic .
But , i would much rather have late terms legal than have them banned .
The article as a whole never made that argument either . Lie number ... . oh I ca n't keep track anymore , let 's just call it 40 .
but too bad science is too chicken to try such an experiment ... we might know the answers to those things .
Invalid argument to assert that mutations can map a road outside of their assigned task in illogical , where would the information to do so come from ?

I would like to point out that it was hardly a land slide . Current admninistration is not as popular as either Reagan or Clinton was . This nation is divided . Nothing is dead .
If the stars were created near the earth and then streched out as the Bible says they were the relationship of time and distance would be quite different and would explain how light from a distant star could be seen .
WHEN GOVERNMENTS ARE A THREAT The U.N. claims that guns used in armed conflicts cause 300,000 deaths worldwide every year . The solution proposed in conference 's `` Program of Action '' ? Keep rebels from getting guns by requiring that countries `` prevent , combat and eradicate '' what those countries who want to stop rebels from getting the guns define as `` the illicit trade in small arms '' This may be an understandable `` solution '' from governments that do n't trust their citizens . But it also represents a dangerous disregard for their citizens ' safety and freedom . Why ? First , and most obviously , because not all insurgencies are `` bad . '' It is hardly surprising that infamous regimes such as those in Syria , Cuba , Rwanda , Vietnam , Zimbabwe , and Sierra Leone support these `` reforms . '' To ban providing guns to rebels in totalitarian countries is like arguing that there is never anything such as a just war . In hindsight , would Europeans have preferred that no resistance was put up against Hitler ? Should the French or Norwegian resistance movements simply have given up ? Surely this would have minimized war causalities .
I got the information from : `` Finally , there is large-scale evolution that may be referred to as molecules-to-man evolution ,
If living things didnt reproduce , then life would quickly disappear .
You 're actually asking a very pertinent question , but you 're phrasing it in a way that 's guaranteed to attract the wrong kind of answer Remember : 'colour ' is a label we attach to a particular electromagnetic wavelength - specifically , the ones our eyes are sensitive , or 'tuned ' to pick up . When you enquire about 'other colours ' existing , you 're in effect talking about non-visible electromagnetic frequencies . Now , we can tune electronic receivers to pretty much any frequency we like , thus 'seeing ' a much broader range of colours , from radio waves to X-rays , gamma rays and so forth . It 's kind of strange to think of it like this , but a radio transmitter is doing exactly the same thing as a torch : spitting out light , just at a different frequency . And since , as you know , you can listen to your radio indoors , that means your opaque-to-visible-light walls are translucent on other frequencies - which is slightly unnerving , frankly . Anyway , by the very meaning of 'colour ' - no , there are no 'colours ' of which we are ignorant that could overturn our understanding of the universe .
However , one thing to consider while debating pro-lifers is that they generally do not care about women 's rights .
Way to support your controversial assertion , Bell .
4. a relationship in which two people have pledged themselves to each other in the manner of a husband and wife , without legal sanction : trial marriage ; homosexual marriage .
Honestly , people like you working within the medical community are just ... wrong .
At the time , I was picturing something along the lines of a T-rex with chicken legs . But still , unles the beast above the legs had developed to be lighter , it would overwhelm the more spindly birdlike legs .
Professor McDonald started with a complete mousetrap and then showed ones with fewer parts . I will reverse that order , start with his simplest trap , and show the steps that would be necessary to convert it into the next more complex trap in his series . That , after all , is the way Darwinian evolution would have to work . If we are to picture this as a Darwinian process , then each separate adjustment must count as a `` mutation . '' If several separate mutations have to occur before we go from one functional trap to the next , then a Darwinian process is effectively ruled out , because the probability of getting multiple unselected mutations that eventually lead to a specific complex structure is prohibitive .

The New Jersey Senate late Thursday passed sweeping amendments to the state 's domestic partner law that would , upon a partner 's death , give the surviving partner control of the estate and inheritance in the absence of a will . The legislation also would give the surviving partner control of burial decisions absent a directive otherwise . In a vote that stunned even LGBT civil rights advocates the Senate vote was unanimous - 35-to-0 . `` This is the most lopsided pro-LGBTI-rights vote in New Jersey history and one of the most lopsided pro-gay votes in American history , '' Garden State Equality spokesperson Steven Goldstein told 365Gay.com

`` Among the criticisms of Kettlewell 's original predation experiments ( and these were first raised by Kettlewell , himself ) is that the numbers of moths he released on trees created artificially high densities , and that the moths were put onto the trunks of trees which may not be where they actually pass the day exposed to predators. `` [ and in fact , at best only a miniscule and negligible fraction of the total wild moth population has ever been observed to do this. -- ww ]
The figure comes from a 1936 study by Dr. Frederick Taussig who estimated that abortion claimed the lives of 5,000 to 10,000 women a year .
... Another problem with the site is that Alan D. Gishlick is without a doubt an evolutionist whereas Jonathan Wells seems to approach the subject with a more objective and neutral view .
I repeat in rebuttal to the ignorant , bigoted and hateful response above . Not to mention anti-american , prejudicial and irrational justification for attempting to deny free americans of their right to vote for a legally held proposition to amend the California Constitution according to the rules outlined in the Constitution of California . And for comparing Americans who simply voted , with Nazi 's who more resemble your groups tactics , than the LDS community .
Well done , martini guy !
Its quite obvious that the poster was n't asking if someone could explain the legal differences between the two . Legality and morality are disconnected , and it seems very obvious that the poster was referring to morality .
Do n't believe me then so be it , but there are many articles that say the effects of marijuana ... at the very least it is like smoking . I stress very least .
poor boo-boo ... You want to talk pain ? I wish the pro-infanticide zealots could experience being dismembered and having their skulls collapsed and their brains sucked out so they 'll know what an innocent baby feels when it 's being aborted .
There ai n't no doubt about it in my mind
In other words , you think there is no room for moderates . But the real world is not so black and white and compromise is often necessary .
Now why would it `` PAIN '' Collins to acknowledge that much of human evolution has had little to do with genes and and more to do with culture and environment ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Why would he care ?

Pro choice is pro child is pro family . Having access to contraception and to abortion if contraception fails or for other reasons strengthens the family .
You can not rationally show us how something can be OUTSIDE of science .
If you want to be honest , you could start by substantiating your claim that you can prove gods do not exist . Or just admit you are a faith based preacher , as bad as any fundamentalist .
Ok , I have no interest in Creationism , and think that Evolution seems the most reasonable explanation of how life developed from its origins . I do n't understand some of the stages , but then the fact that my computer can play Rome Total War is pretty mindblowing too , so that does n't bother me . Just one question : ID is not a scientific position as it ca n't be tested , falsified , confirmed by experiment etc . But can evolution go through these scientific systems ? Surely it is a sort of meta-theory that fits the data but can not be tested ?
How could then the goverment work
Databed , Mosheh seems to be proposing that the biblical creation account is metaphorical . Therefore , if reality does not exactly match it , it does not invalidate the whole of the Bible . You ca n't really get him there - metaphorical is not literal . You can have Eve as the first genetic human and Adam her sexual partner , and declare that they were created by god via the Big bang - and it will be covered by a metaphorical interpretation of the biblical creation account .
So what ? A person has a right to defend themselves , as spelled out in the Constitution . Or would you rather the 80 year old just get beaten to death for his $ 262 ? Or maybe you 'd feel better if he 'd suffered the same fate as the home invader over in Maryland . He made the mistake of breaking and entering into a student house and was slaughtered with a sword . And what point are you trying to make anyway ? It 's not like the 80 year old went on a killing spree of anything . Nobody got murdered . So what 're you moaning about ?

Apparently , we 're headed into an ice age of about 100,000 years -- give or take . As for CO2 levels , core samples show conclusively they follow the earth 's temperature rise , not lead it .
You 're right . Both clearly stated that they did not support gay marriage . The difference that is being pointed out in the article you quoted is this : Biden DID clearly say he believed gay couples should have equal rights when it came to things like hospital visitation , insurance , etc . [ b ] He asked Palin directly whether she believed the same [ /b

only if the woman wanted the baby .
No , your idea about science is a philiosophy of science . Sure , it 's got a lot of believers , but historically it is not the only vision of science people have believed in . There is metaphysical evidence . The Apostles saw Jesus walk on water . There was no 'measure ' by your version of science , but what they saw remains true .
Im shuddering thinking about all the accidental deaths related to children .
Abortion is allowed by law due to judicial action . If it were taken to a referendum , I would vote to oppose it . Especially for it to ever be paid for by tax money . But , it will not . If people in debate and in their every day lives would demand responsible sexual activity and continually express the possibilities involved with sex and frown upon people becoming pregnant when they in fact do not desire children versus defending their right to eliminate the result , abortions might become less attractive as an answer . The slaughter could wane . In a sentence , if people would consider the effects of their actions , they would not place themselves in the position to make life and death decisions on the innocent .
I just was impressed that the fossil was not found by happenstance .
It really piques me when someone attempts to assume what my opinion is without asking me . You know nothing about me or my views . People ask questions to learn and have been doing so for years . The only stupid question is the unasked one . If you have a problem answering the questions then do n't .
I 'm sure that if you could assure folks with children having Downs Syndrome that you would extend loving care to their children in the event these children 's parents died prematurely or the children survived the parents and take care of these children for the rest of your lives or ensure their care for as long as they lived , the parents might very well choose not to abort .
Statement on Fort Hood Tragedy Nov 6 , 2009 Washington , DC - Paul Helmke , President of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence , issued the following statement about the tragedy at Fort Hood , Texas : Our deepest sympathies go to the families who lost loved ones or are today visiting them in the hospital . Along with the rest of the country , we wish the Fort Hood community a return to a secure and safe environment . When I heard of the tragedy yesterday , we were in the midst of planning a response to the latest dangerous legislative proposal from the gun lobby in the United States Senate - language to automatically restore access to guns to veterans designated by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Justice Department as mentally incapacitated or mentally incompetent. In light of what happened yesterday - a violent attack by an emotionally unstable soldier - it is even clearer that the proposal being pushed by Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina should be rejected . America has seen an epidemic of horrific gun violence at churches and synagogues , workplaces , health clubs , high schools , universities , police stations and now Army bases . This latest tragedy , at a heavily fortified army base , ought to convince more Americans to reject the argument that the solution to gun violence is to arm more people with more guns in more places . Enough is enough. # # # As the nation 's largest , non-partisan , grassroots organization leading the fight to prevent gun violence , the Brady Campaign , with its dedicated network of Million Mom March Chapters , works to enact and enforce sensible gun laws , regulations and public policies .

What are the reasons which you would present behind the statement `` all human life is sacred '' ( or whichever similar statement you think is the core of your pro-life stance ) ?
What parts of the Bible are true , and how do you disguingish between the information that is true and not true ?
I know it irks you that your faith can not be proven , but that 's the definition of faith ! ! It would n't be faith without it . Why then look for support from reason ?
I ca n't think of any good reason to qualify the delivery of healthcare other than need for a physician . Where one lives or does n't live , makes no difference , and neither does the fact that a person has broken the law . Health care is a civil and human right in a democratic society .
DNA does not dictate who we are ,
That is your right . But it does not make the `` Bang '' true .
one other point , and i brought this up lots of times here and elsewhere , is that about `` christian/evolutionism hybrids '' . that is , those that disregard the genesis story in the light of `` modern discoveries '' , yet they believe that God exists and that salvation through jesus is attainable as the bible prescribes . while it is logically impossible to disregard genesis and at the same time accept the new testament , many people out there are comfortable with the idea . it totally eludes me though

What is not only very interesting , but incredible is that in this whole thread this is the only post which has even attempted to answer the OP question . Effective Arguments For Disproving Biblical CreationEverything else written has been personal attacks and non responses to the arguments I have posted .

Just compare the early blizzard that just hit the two Dakotas here in the states with that of the 1920 North Dakota blizzard to see if there is a difference between now and then .
Well that was a lovely story and cudos on working in the anti-war angle . No , the 50 or more GIANT posters in a row alongside a public ( taxpayer funded ) roadway do not affect me personaly in any way from a shock perspective . As I said , I am strongly against abortion , I have seen the same pictures many times before . My complaint is the virtual forcing of all citizens to view the photos as they drive down a public roadway , and the harrassing of motorists at stop lights . Mainly my point in posting this thread was to try to find out if this was a common type of anti-abortion protest in other parts of the country . I 'm quite sure many other `` conservatives '' will view this type of protest as a wonderful thing . I think it actually works against the anti-abortion movement and alienates potential supporters .

But , even if all this were untrue , it really has nothing to do with America . Canada may very well have been prepared to accept gays into its army without serious repercussions , specifically a degradation of its cohesion . If this is the case , then good for them . It does not mean America is in any such stage .
Not sure what you mean . Natural selection is one of several mechanisms of evolution . Evolution is a change in the genetic makeup of a population of organisms over generations . Natural selection tends to decrease genetic diversity - thus changing the relative frequencies of genetic characteristics . There are othere mechanisms that also tend to decrease genetic diversity , and , of course , there are mechanisms that tend to increase it .

I think there is something wrong with Premse One . It translates into English as `` If God exists , then he exists in all possible worlds . '' No logical rule justifies this statement . It is equally foolish to say that `` If England exists , then it exists in all possible worlds . '' But clearly , England does not exist in the possible world where Earth never formed .

This theory is made up of nothing more than the imaginings of a young cosmologist back in 1929 yet has been adopted as a rational theory by the scientific community as if they are a bunch of lemmings who will grasp at any explanation which does n't claim that God did it .
However , ever since he ( Chuz ) started a thread attempting to convince others of this 'fact ' , he has consistently ignored the vast majority of arguments against his reasoning - while continuing to tout the 'fact ' in other threads .

Again , you are the affirmative , you must support your claims . Please support the claim that we are using an atheist presupposition . I think we are using more an agnostic presupposition , which is a neutral one .
as far as science is concerned , religion was science 's biggest proponent . in the early days everything in science was viewed from a creationist perspective . you can say that `` creationist science '' was what science came from
***Yawn*** revisionist history ... Well here are the facts from http : //www.gunowners.org/fs0404.htm : D. Myth # 4 : Recent gun control laws have reduced the U.S. murder rate . 1 . Murder rate was already decreasing before Brady and semi-auto gun ban passed . Those who claim that the two gun control laws enacted in 1994 have reduced the murder rate ignore the fact that the U.S. murder rate has been decreasing from the high it reached in 1991.172 Thus , the murder rate had already begun decreasing two to three years before the Brady law and the semi-auto gun ban became law . 2 . Murder rate decrease results from fewer violent youths . The Democratic Judiciary Committee noted in 1991 that , `` An analysis of the murder tolls since 1960 offers compelling evidence of the linkthe significant rise of murder in the late 1960 's , and the slight decrease in murder in the early 1980 's follows from an unusually large number of 18-24 year-olds in the general population . This age group is the most violent one , as well as the group most likely to be victimizedand the murder figures ebb and flow with their ranks . `` 173 ( Emphasis added . ) 3 . According to the Clinton Justice Department , crime has decreased even while the number of guns increased . The Bureau of Justice Statistics , the research arm of the Justice Department , reported in 2000 that while the number of firearms in circulation rose nearly 10 % during a recent five-year period , gun-related deaths and woundings dropped 33 % .174 4 . Concealed carry laws have dropped murder and crime rates in the states that have enacted them . According to a comprehensive study which studied crime statistics in all of the counties in the United States from 1977 to 1992 , states which passed concealed carry laws reduced their murder rate by 8.5 % , rapes by 5 % , aggravated assaults by 7 % and robbery by 3 % .175
Thought of the Day : Can anyone conceivably conceptualize the irony of the pregnancy of a woman is called 'conception ' ? Conceptually , it is conceived that present tense of this conception is to conceive a child . I am curious as to know whether or not conceive and concept are participles or perhaps conjugations of a single word or are they two different words used interchangably . I am doubly curious to know as to how pregnancy came about as being conceived as conceptual ?

Using exaggerated figures allows health advocate sages to capitalize on the emotionalism of childhood fatalities and thereby evade legitimate questions about their proposal to ban and confiscate handguns as a means of reducing such ( p.570 ) tragedies . We offer the following questions which , of course , are never mentioned in the health advocacy literature on children and guns : If so sweeping a measure as confiscating 230 million firearms is justified because some 273 children under age fifteen die in firearm accidents annually , is the less intrusive measure of banning child bicycles justified by the death of three times as many children in bicycle accidents annually ? [ 226 ] If confiscating over 80 million handguns is justified because approximately fifteen children under age five die in handgun accidents annually , is a ban on cigarette lighters justified by the fact that four times as many children in that age group die from playing with then annually ? Consider the fact that over 400 % more children under age fifteen die in drownings than in gun accidents ; [ 227 ] twenty times as many children under age five drown in bathtubs and home swimming pools as are killed in handgun accidents . [ 228 ] Few people need a bathtub ( as opposed to a shower stall ) or a swimming pool . If the tragedy of accidental childhood gun fatalities justifies confiscating over 80 million handguns , or all of the more than 230 million firearms , do the much greater numbers of tragic childhood drownings justify a licensing system under which only the disabled and others who show they `` truly need '' a bathtub or swimming pool will be allowed to have them ?

O.k. , lets go through your scenario . The government has been toppled and the standing army has been crushed . Somehow all Americas nuclear arms were obliterated . The invading force has successfully instituted a dictatorship and is now systematically destroying our personal freedoms . Now suppose the year is 1799 and the population rises up . The five rounds with 200 million guns , works . The population overthroughs the invading army through sheer numbers , though the price is high in terms of casualties . America is once again free and the democratic system is once again put in place . The year is 2004 , the population is no longer fit and tough from working in the fields to get their own food . But each of the 400 million people has a gun , with lets say 30 rounds each . The population now has 12 billion rounds , and lets assume each round is an armour piercing bullet with long range capabilities , and lets also assume for the hell of it , that each gun is a machine gun with long-range single shot abilities and a scope ( just for fun ) . Same situation , same invading force . The population rises up , taking along with them the few remaining rockets and bombs from the few remaining weapons caches . Lets say 2 million hand-held anti-plane missiles , 4 million anti-tank missiles and for even more fun , lets say they have a genius military leader who has somehow the ability to maintain instant contact with any unit anywhere , and is the greatest tactical mind the planet has ever know . To overthrough the standing American army the invading force must have had massive numbers of planes , tanks and naval units . First off , 4 million anti-tank weapons is not much when put against 400 million people , so you have a lot of venerable areas . Where ever the militia units try to form , they are killed by tanks , even though many of the tanks with infantry backing are destroyed the army keeps going because to over through America who has the greatest tanks in the world , you would have to have like 10-1 ratio on the American armed divisions . But , wait . Lets assume somehow the ground forces of well-organized troops and tanks is defeated by the population . Lets assume the invading army again somehow lost all its ground units , lets pretend the enemy forces had exactly 4 million tanks , and the ratio of shot-to-kill was perfect . To defeat the American army of planes you would , again , have to have massive numbers ( or technology superior planes ) . So the population tries shooting down the planes , but the planes would usually get away because modern planes can take out a ground-based target with out ever going closer the a couple miles . But again , wait . Somehow , without losing so many troops as not to be able to defeat the massive mechanized occupying force , all planes are spotted ( miles away ) and shoot down by the UNTRAINED militia . The genius military leaders ( who no body though to kill ) work no doubt . Yet still , the population is defeated because if I remember correctly , the militia doesnt have naval units . So even if all the inland forces could be killed , the majority of costal forces would be protected by barrages from the enemy naval force ( which is very large because it had to defeat the American navy , the greatest in the world technologically ) . But lets assume , the population just swims to the invading ships , kills the crews , and uses the ships they stole to kill the other enemy ships . Thank god for that tactical genius at the helm of the American resistance . I am actually guessing that invading force must be like 20 times bigger then Americas armies for one simple reason . The only way you could defeat the American ICBMs is to have a blitzkrieg ( I know my spelling sucks ) like attack . Most of the ICBM silos are n't connected to the internet , mainly because the government knows the silos would be venerable to internet attack , so any rebuttal involving the virus-like disabling of the nuclear stockpile is gone . Now , you may be wondering what am I trying to say here . Well its simple , if somehow , just somehow , the entire military force of the U.S. was obliterated , it would take just one ICBM hit on the enemy 's capital city to make attack impossible . Again , the blitzkrieg like attack ? Even if that worked the U.S. , like Russia and a few other nuclear powers , keeps stockpiles of nuclear weapons hidden underground in the invent of being taken over , and the underground stockpiles usually have several rockets with enough range to blast the heck out of the closest invading army . So it would never happen that the U.S. would be left nuclear-naked . But lets assume that happened ( maybe during a really , REALLY cool party some XXXXX colonel peed on them , and they just fried ) . The genius military commander did somehow take out the entire invading force of air , ground and sea . You still have to deal with the fact that whoever invaded the U.S. probably spend several trillion doing it ( I know , thats a pretty low number for the invasion of America ) , and in that case most likely have satellites and long-range missiles ( again lets assume somehow Americas own just fell out of the sky and the invading force got even guys together to be able to take out all Americas nuclear silos including the underground stockpiles which each have own guard forces of soldiers training night and day for such an event ) . The hugest , most glaring problem with the militia , unless every one the 400 million militia units somehow got a radio and a laptop , they would have to gather . And if they gathered in the numbers they would need to gather in , to order to defeat the large invading army , they would be taken out very easily by 1 . ICBMs launched from enemy subs 2 . Prominent meetings between our military genius and his supporters stopped by snipers with a 1.5 mile range and superb training and intelligence ( remember those satellites ) 3. all groups preparing for `` battle '' so to speak could be taken out as they are marching or driving or whatever by mortars , ambushes , rockets , infantry rushes , tank columns etc . before they knew what hit them . 4 . It would take a lot of planning to get 400 million people to fight , and assuming everybody has a laptop with wireless capability , they would still need satellites for the military genius in California to command units in N.Y. , N.Y. , and ... .wait Americas satellites are gone and if the invading force could do that , it would n't be that hard to take out commercial internet satellites in geoscyhronize orbit ( effectively sitting ducks ) . And any land based networks would be destroyed in the first few hours of insurrection . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- But militia units only have guns , and they would get their butts whooped , even with massive numbers . What you are saying is only true about Napoleonic tactics , in todays modern warfare almost completely infantry-based armies are obsolete and very venerable No the afghan war is not a valid counterpoint , the terrain was different , the people are more hardened , the weapons were supplied by a military power superior to the Russians , the afghans had unlimited anti-tank reserves , had incredibly extensive cave networks in which to hide , plan and attack , only had to defeat , on the majority , other infantry battalions because of the terrain in which armoured vehicles could not cross , the Russians were under funded and their moral low , the soviets had already been beaten down by large amounts of smaller fights across the cracking Soviet Empire , china needed to be supplied with more troops as it started to look toward independence , Afghanistan is nowhere near water eliminated the possibility of naval back-up by the very crappy Russian naval forces , the afghans received help from the rest of the Arab world which would not happen with the U.S. because if an enemy can take out the U.S. , it could probably take out the combined forces of Europe and North America , and , finally , the afgans did n't have nukes so they had to defend themselves with their own two hands , but america has nukes and if ever anything tryed to do what is in the above senario they would get blasted because unlike the russians in afganhistan , the americans would be defended their homeland . Neither is the French revolution a good-counter point , as I have said , your tactics only work with Napoleonic-style battles and guess what kind of battle were happening when Napoleon the 3rd was in power ? ( in case you did n't learn it in school , Napoleon the 3rd , napoleon 's nephew , was in power during the french revolution ) Trust me , cause the only thing I love more then physics is military tactics and warfare . -- -- As I have shown in more detail , Treat2 is right , it would n't work. -- -- -- The other amendments do n't pertain to retaining the sovereignty of the U.S.A , they pertain to the basic rights each citizen enjoys and therefore will always be important and `` In Fashion '' so long as the U.S. still has human citizens .

You kind of misrepresent cones view . He does n't believe in abortion in cases or rape ( neither do I ) . This is why we maintain that you might be obligated to keep the violionist attached for those 9 months . Another way to look at it would be if you wanted to stay attached to the violionist . Does this mean the violionst has to do whatever you want to do now ? Do you believe you have ownership over the violionist ? Could you stab him in the back of the neck if you wanted to ?

I do n't understand why pro-lifers dismiss pregnancy as easy and/or suggest that it 's a wonderful snuggly thing that 's just the best thing in the world .

If you do n't want a baby and are being forced to go through it , it 's unbearable . . . . . this life-threatening condition [ pregnancy ] that is always physically harmful .

It probably would have been better if Scalia had said to himself when the case was brought before the court , `` There certainly is no consensus about the meaning of the Second Amendment and I , as an amateur historian , am certainly not going to force my own personal views on others .

In developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders .
I believe he is referring to everyone going to the courts to get what they want instead of the old fashion way , voting .
Certainly interesting . I wonder two things . I would want to look closer at the study design and two , I would like to hear a beaviorist point of view on it . What would skinner have said ? I doubt that he would have attributed the results to a `` sense of fairness '' since that is not an observable item . He likely would have stated that any two animals receiving differential rewards would have likely learned that if they wait then they also will receive a more liked item . Not a sense of justice but learning by observation . Tolman further would argue that conditioned taste responses for the monkey receiving the preferred reward would be of greater value . In other words , if they were rewarded sometime when they did n't do anything would their work rate go down compared to the other monkey ? Would the other monkey continue at the same rate although it may not accept the less preferred food ? These are important pieces I feel are missing from the information .
The word `` evolution '' has such a broad meaning that it does n't have to mean atheism , but it since it is practically the only weapon that atheists have to combat the religious worldview , that 's what it often DOES mean . If it should n't mean it , but it is used so that it does , then that 's what it actually means .

They do n't ... but that 's the principle issue behind many ACLU lawsuits and protests regarding treatment of criminals , especially if they get hurt while committing the crime . I will agree that they deserve a fair trial , but that is about all they deserve ... if they live through their attempt to harm the victim . If they die trying to harm the victim , we are spared the cost of a trial . You are spot on regarding the lack of ethics or morality in the perps . They are being neither ethical nor of high moral standing ... why should I have to be in my defense ?
If Genesis is simply a representative story from which we can interpret the actions of god to mean natural selection and evolution , what about the ten commandments ?

The militia of the Second Amendment is a militia that is described as being well regulated ( regulated by both the federal government and the states as spoken of in Article 1 of the Constitution ) . In our own day , I think the National Guard would be the only militia that qualifies as being well regulated . Alexander Hamilton spoke of the desirability of the militia being well regulated : `` It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects , whenever they were called into service for the public defense . It would enable them to discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army ; and it would fit them much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be essential to their usefulness . This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority . It is , therefore , with the most evident propriety , that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the Union `` to provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining the militia , and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States , RESERVING TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS , AND THE AUTHORITY OF TRAINING THE MILITIA ACCORDING TO THE DISCIPLINE PRESCRIBED BY CONGRESS . '' The Federalist Papers - THOMAS ( Library of Congress ) We could go back to the days when most citizens were required to enroll in the militia , have guns and get military training- to what the Founders really meant when they spoke of a well regulated militia being the security of a free state . But the Supreme Court along with pro-gun activists claiming to be pro- Second Amendment have decided to turn their back on that part of the Second Amendment while giving the lip service to the idea of a militia .
Notice how it describes the level life on Earth had attained around 270 million years ago , yet I just watched a documentary on Nat . Geo that very clearly showed that 270 million years ago , the Earth was basically engulfed in volcanic flames . Another example of contradictory evidence within the scientific community regarding the different stages of evolution the Earth experienced in order to get where we 're at today .
The Brady Bunch are going to work that mentally incapacitated/incompetent stuff to the best of their ability .
The idea of abortion as population control is absurd , especially forced abortions as someone mentioned a few posts ago . Anyone who has read a biology book knows the world has methods of population control on its own , we do n't need to be doing stuff like that ourselves . This stat sounds more than a bit inflated . Seeing as it comes from a website called `` women 's issues '' it is probably not all that credible .
Oh so EVERYTHING except creation works without His help , I get it God makes everything . So God made our minds , and God made the scientific ideas that come into our minds , so God helped us understand all the things we do about science . But oh I guess that evil evolution one is the one scientific thought that came from Satan ... obviously ! ! !

Originally posted by dsadevil The purpose of a car is not to kill someone/thing with , it is for transportation . If it is misused , it can kill , but as y'all claim , that applies to anything . The key difference with guns is that the primary and really sole purpose of guns is to kill something with . No one carries them for aeshtitic appeal . Is it true some people carry them for defense ? Sure , but its defense on the premise that you can kill someone who attacks you , or at least deter them via threat of death . This is n't to take sides in this debate , I do n't want to . But I have heard this argument made many times before , and it is getting annoying because it is clearly invalid .

Are you familiar withe the phrase `` tyranny of the majority '' ? Amazing how many Americans do n't understand how the Constitution is intended to protect minorities from the majority .
You have this backwards . The word theory was originally a scientific word , and then it was adapted into common speech to mean a range of things not originally designated to that word . Words like evolve , gravity and congruent have different meanings within the realm of science than they have outside .
I do intend to help my community and share the responsibility through non-violent means .
you 're on the right track ; the problem with evolution is that it has no verifiable creator -- the fact is , mutations ( which supposedly add new raw material for selection ) have never shown to add any new structure or even a new part to any existing structure . It 's a sad fact for evos .

I like your thinking , although I disagree with it . You say that God is the universe . I propose that God is relational . That without a relational god we are truly hopeless .
It seemed logical to me once , the idea of macro-evolution . Let us suppose we have a species called `` X '' . If over a period of time the population became split by distance , we could call them `` X-1 '' and `` X-2 '' . Again , over a period of time , changes may have happened in one group , through mutations , so that `` X-1 '' may have changed so much that if the two populations were ever re-united , they 'd be unable to inter-breed ... thus they 'd be two distinct species . Evolutionaries call this Sympatric Speciation .

Based on threads I 've been reading here , there is a real tendency among some of the pro-choicers to portray pregnancy as a horrible thing that cause women to suffer -- that it is somthing bad or undesirable . - How could the opportunity to bring a life into the world , a wonderful miracle , be so awful by default ? Rather than bring into this peripheral thoughts to the question , such as rights and legal issues ( which are discussed at length here already in other threads ) , I 'd love to hear straightforward relelvant answers to this . I am also already aware that pregnancy can sometimes involve complications or that it can at times cause financial constraints . But I am mainly interested in seeing why there is a default tendency in pro-choice arguments to argue from the standpoint of pregnancy being a bad thing . Any thoughts ?
I will not alter my foundational belief in marriage and family just because some cry for freedom at all costs .
Regardless of the name change , the calendars are still keyed on the birth and death of Christ ... and that will be so at least until the atheists are able to come up with another numbering system and force it on everyone else just to pacify their own baby mentalities .
hey ! i was gon na say the same thing jim just said , whadya know ! but basically , God can not do the illogical , like create a round square , simply because it can not be done . it is by nature illiogical for any rock to be unbreakable , no matter how hard it is . in fact , something as simple as adding 2+2 and getting 3 is impossible for God . that doesnt make him less omnipotent , just means that there are certain illogicalities that can never exist
Prove it ! Prove that there would be no rooted trees at all within the sedimentary layers at all . And prove that there would be no tracks or burrows or evidence of plant life as we find . In fact we would expect to find all of those things as evidence that this event was fast and cataclysmic in order to find all of these things together in the same areas .
Here 's how life really operates ... .. Take a look at this link : http : //people.bu.edu/jtouchon/tadpole.htm In it you will see an experiment with tadpoles . Some tadpoles were raised in an enviornment with fish ; some with dragonfly nymphs ; and some alone . If you were to believe evolutionists , you would have to believe that a tadpole is a tadpole is a tadpole . And specific traits would only arise from the luck of the draw . But look at the above link . What really happens is tadpole generate different traits based on their predators . The tadpoles raised with dragonfly nymphs generated shorter bodies and different colored tails than those raised alone or with fish . Thus if a population of tadpoles were raised in a pond that was newly inhabited by dragonfly nymphs , it might APPEAR that tadpoles evolved new traits via selection ... .but what 's really happening is phenotypic plasticity . My assertion is that much of what is considered `` evolution '' in the field is nothing more than a morphological response similar to what the tadpoles show in this link . Finch beaks , moth wing variation , lizard legs , and every other so-called `` proof '' of evolution would be no different . This is why it 's extrememly important that science does controlled experiments . If the experiments are not controlled and populations of animals are merely observed generating new triats in the field after serveral years or generations , there is no scientific justification in saying the traits were formed via selection . Not only that , but why is it that science is willing to test plasticity , yet is not willing to carry the test out further to see if the offspring of tadpoles emerge with shorter bodies and redder tails ? Why wo n't they test the concept that individuals can evolve ? My final comment/question , aside from the fact that this tadpole example falsifies the linked explanation for evolution , is I would like you evolutionists to tell me how this is accomplished . I mean HOW does the tail of a tadpole change to red simply because a predator is around ? How does that happen without the mind or some sort of intelligence being involved ? I would like an explanation . Please also keep in mind that if all observed occurrences of evolution are actually just cases of phenotypic plasticity , then there 's no sense in saying Selection actually occurs . If selection does n't occur then evolution is falsified .
N. Wells ... if the Neanderthal morphology changed into modern human morphology quickly , then that means non-evolutionary mechanisms were responsible .

This is the `` right '' SCOTUS to hear the case , IMO .
If marriage is so sacred socially , then heterosexuals who get married should never divorce , and quickie marriages that celebrities have all of the time should n't be allowed ( Not to mention things like Joe Millionaire and the Bachelorette ) . This should n't be a social issue because if it is , it 's allowing the government to make individuals to adhere to a set of moral codes that only a select group believes . The government should approach this as a legal matter , which it is , and allow the legally binding marriage of homosexuals which affords them the same benefits that every other couple who pays 80 bucks to a local courthouse can enjoy . If you have a problem with it socially , then you probably also have a problem with homosexuals in the first place , and thats a problem that you need to deal with on your own . Otherwise , keep your mouth shut and let the government dole out legal unions ( or dare I say `` marriages '' ) to same sex couples and let that be the end of it . If the word marriage bothers you so much because of the religious background of the word , get over it . The word is a useful way to describe the legal binding of any two individuals who may have a different faith than the one where some claim the word 's definition is derived from . Atheist couples get married in courthouses because `` marriage '' in the legal sense has no religious affiliation . So , this being a purely legal matter , there should be no question that any two people can enjoy this legal right .

If I can find the time , is anyone here interested in debating the virgin birth in the debate section ? I would debate it didnt happen .
I do n't know what I think about this . Personally , I believed that Cain and Seth did marry their sisters . I know , sounds like incest , and today that is what it would be . However , you need to remember that there were no exact set of laws at the beginning of the creation . Almost all of God 's followers were spoken to by him and were given visions and angels to tell them what to do . I do n't believe it was considered incest till the law was written abolishing that sort of thing . I 'm not sure about him creating other women either , but you could be right . After all , I 've found the idea of him creating life on other planets AFTER the creation acceptable ( still wondering about the end of the creation where he stopped though ) so with that view in mind , I suppose it 's possible .

Your answers are ridiculous , ChuzLife , just like all the others . I never mentioned a child trap . You are all liars trying to distort My posts , and hide from the realities of abortion . I said a womb-trapped child . Thats 100 % descriptive . Its a child , in the womb , who is not able to leave . I never said that they are trapped by the vagina . I never suggested that pre-birth children float around and are somehow `` caught '' in a trap . None of your can face up to the Forbidden Truth on abortion .
Sorry to disappoint you , Occam , but partial-birth aboprtion is not `` extremely rare , '' as you purport .
and your point is ?
Wow marc . You spent some time thinking about this video .
It is disappointing that you would continue with this mistake . I said that God is both knowable and unknowable . You simply think that equates to the same thing , and thus you argue against what you believe I say , rather than what I said .
Then there 's the fact that supporters of gun control have argued that gun owners should be required to pay a fee for each gun they register , and that the registration process should be something that needs to be repeated every single year , and the fee paid every time as well . Then there was the proposal over in Pennsylvania where an officer would be allowed to deny registration for any reason , meaning automatic forfeiture of your weapons due to the `` only registered guns are legal guns '' policy that certain people embrace like the holy scripture . And then there 's the fact that registration leads to confiscation . We 've seen it happen as recently as 12 years ago , we know it 's the outright truth . Not long after the New York spree killing , the newspaper covering the proposal of gun licenses needing to be renewed every five years explicitly stated that if the registration lapsed the guns would be confiscated .
What guy and what post ?
Well , it is all really silly . You 're fighting over an issue that will never be resolved . Believ what you want , because you can never be proven wrong . Let church teach creation and school teach evolution , stop fighting over this , and everyone will be happy .

Let 's not go into what bigotry means , I think we all get your point anyway .
Coincidentally , see my most recent post in the 'Philippines ' thread . If you look at the proportion of ( for example ) murders in the UK , you will find that a piffling 7 % of homicides were carried out by shooting in 07/08 ( and 8 % in 06/07 ) . To say that 'most attackers are armed ' is missing the mark by a factor of 7 . Incidentally , over 50 % of homicides were committed by gun in the US . And you ca n't blame it on the gans , either ( although they certainly contributed ) . EDIT : NATO posted . I feel that this is a suitable reply to his post , too - although I 'd add that the media in any country does tend to blow statistics out of proportion . Or take a single incident and imply that it is a nationwide epidemic .
We must agree that both of these examples are mere therory science can not observe actual evoultion of life nor can we see creation as it is describe in genisis .

What does this mean in terms of proving their existence ? Since their interactions with us are outside the realm of science , science ca n't really say anything unless the dieties in question specifically choose to interact with us in a way which science could verify . That is to say , the existence of any God ca n't be proven against that God 's will , but I believe that if a diety wanted to have it 's existence known than it would certainly be able to do so .

Would you have supported the `` freedom '' for Hitler and his cronies to own guns in 1932 ? Mao in 1947-48 ? Because those freedoms directly led to the abrogation of the ultimate right -- the right to life -- for at least 30 million people .
and that creation scientists are liars .
In your very thoughtful contribution you explicitly state that you `` regard the Bible as true and authoritative in all that it affirms '' - including one must suppose the account it gives of the origin of life . Presumably , you are convinced therefore that God is the First Cause - whether or not he chose to bring about organic effects by evolutionary means ? If we can include `` evolutionism '' among the sciences , then as a science it does not , indeed it can not , attribute metaphysical causes to physical effects . There is no such thing as `` metaphysical evidence '' . As you are content to describe yourself as a Christian Evolutionist , you invite the question , `` How do you account for the origins of life without invoking a Final Cause for which there is no scientific evidence ? ''
The theory of evolution as it applies to life on earth : Essentially that the various living things on the earth are a product of purely physical/natural laws , which can be rationally explained .

Here we have a case of an event where we definitely need some objective reporting . I suspect this was simply intended to be a PRIVATE SCREENING of a film . Private screening are extremely common in the film world . The whole idea of a private screening is that ... well , it 's private . Meaning , only some people are allowed to the screening . If they were rejecting people at the door , it was obviously a private screening , so one has to wonder why these guys were trying to get in to begin with if they were n't invited . This does n't sound like a case of anyone trying to bring science in to challenge something , but rather someone trying to crash a private screening of a film . So essentially , someone who 's eager to play the hypocrisy card blogs about trying to sneak into a private screening of a film , but getting kicked out while his celebrity companion managed to get in . Big whoopin ' deal . Since there does n't seem to actually be any objective reporting done on this event , here 's a different blog entry of the event that presents it in a different ( and probably more realistic ) light ... Did Richard Dawkins just crash the party at a screening of Expelled ? Some of the comments in the comments section there also shed light on the incident .
You just do n't get it . Americans are freemen . Your faith in governments over people is humorous ... How does it fell to lick the bootheels of your government overlords ... ..

How does your government feel about that ?

That 's real diversity . Disagreeing but not being disagreeable . Since Amaechi came out , I 've read lots of columns about being `` progressive . '' The implication -- or outright assertion -- is that anyone who believes homosexuality is wrong is not progressive or enlightened .

That is to say , DNA sufficiently similar and sufficiently widespread for the attainment of our target sequence to be statistically feasible via known mechanisms ( mutation etc ) .

In the same sense that shooting an intruder when he 's charging at you is the same , in principle , as shooting a fleeing intruder . When the baby is born , there are a myriad of choices open that would relieve the mother of the responsibility of motherhood while allowing it to live . There are no other choices open to her to relieve her of the fetus inside of her .
But the problem is that Neo-darwinists claim that DNA is in complete isolation and goes on its merry way , regardless of any pressures and effects of the environment .

I realise that Databeds original question was designed to highlight that creationism is based solely on the bible . However , your reply caused me to go all tangental . If you believe that a planet populated solely by atheists would remain solely atheist ( without the influence of God ) , on what basis do you explain the many other religions that exist on Earth ? Especially those that were around before Christianity , and can not therefore be accused of copying a successful format ?

I am suggesting that ( assuming a God exists ) the nature of God is unknowable in the realm in which we exist . Unlike a square or a rock or a chair or a tree which are of this physical realm , and for which we can make a definition and then test the object to determine if it fits the definition , we can not do this with God , simply because there is no way to 'test ' God within the physical realm in which we exist .
There 's no question that evangelical atheists do exist : convinced not only of their beliefs but that it would be better for more people to share them . I 'm not sure they 're wrong , and I 'm happy for them to make their case - but not in a science classroom .

What the hell is with the necro-posting ?
The resistant bacterium has not evolved  in fact it has digressed genetically and is defective . Such a mutant strain is rapidly replaced by superior ( i.e . natural ) bacteria as soon as the antibiotic is removed . Another example would be the hairless Chihuahua dog . In extreme heat , reduction of size and loss of hair may be useful adaptation , but this involves degeneration . Sanford And this is more important than it may seem . The fact is , its not just bacteria  but all of life is in a state of constant degeneration via mutations .
As far as I can see , Evolutionists agree that natural selection is how we have evolved for microscopic life forms . To me this means that a single organism in a species mutates , giving it and its offspring an advantage over the rest of the population . If this mutation is random does n't that mean that the gene pool for every species would be very small as , in the long run , only the offspring of the mutated species would survive ?
I did n't miss the part where the doctor stated that the woman 's health `` could '' be in danger . I also did n't miss the part where they would have to wait until the children were developed into late stages before deciding which ones to kill . In this case , the parents went to such extremes so as to become pregnant that they expose themselves as callously toying with lives to accomodate their own plans , then whining pre-emptively lest someone challenge their attempt at godhood . Conservatives do not want to select who dies for convenience sake . Only liberals would actually protest and make demands for the so called `` right '' to kill their babies .

I do n't think those blanket statements necessarily apply . You have to realize that there is something behind the proclamations of that sort of morality ; human life is sacred is n't just a proclamation , it 's a philosophy . The case could just as easily be made that pro-choicers are basing their morality on a proclamation as well , that `` reason is the basis for morality '' . Even if you call either a case of proclamation , it 's the philosophy behind it that serves as the basis for the morality , not statement itself .
While the eye is a well enough example , it puzzles me that in an age in which genomes are being sequenced , we should rely so heavily on the eye in this way . Anyone looking at the human genome , or any other for that matter , will be most hard pressed to argue that this is an `` intelligently designed '' structure -- it is replete with repetitve junk , nonsensical extraneous DNA , non-coding segments that have no relation to other genes on their shared chromosome , genetic parasites , and so on and so forth . And adrift in this sea of rubbish , are scattered a few clusters of sense , coding for amino acids and regulating the process . I think Paley , had he seen the genome , would have been berfet with grief for the death of his argument . Vindex Urvogel
Can anyone make a rational argument as to why executing a criminal who was 18 years old when committing the crime is not `` cruel and unusual punishment , '' but executing a criminal who was less than 18 at the time of the crime would be cruel and unusual ? Put another way , can anyone explain why it is constitutional to execute a person who was 18 years old when they committed the crime , but it is unconstitutional to execute a person who was under 18 when they committed the crime ? Participants in this discussion should assume that the death penalty , in general , is constitutional . This has been the case from the beginning of our Republic , and has been reaffirmed multiple times . In other words , it is not an appropriate argument to try and argue that the death penalty , in general , is unconstitutional . That has neither been the case through our history , and is not the current state of the law . *Note : I am speaking within the context of the United States , and its Constitution .

Personally , I have seen enough human nature , and have too low an opinion of the human race as a whole to really mourn when I hear that one or more human beings has left this mortal coil . Kids are the exception ( including the unborn ones ) . I think it really says something about us as a people that some of us actually make the decision to kill babies . Pretty sick .
I was n't thinking the term 'micro-evolution ' but that does work . My point was that the idea of evolution is a gradual change over a long period of time . ( I 've never head the term `` macro-evolution '' ( nor `` micro-evolution honestly ) but I assume that 's what it is until you suggest different . ) I guess the change in beak size is more noticeable than gradual . My point for asking the question was from the selection that you quoted . I point out what stuck out to me ... What I saw was that if the finch are evolving a smaller beak because of the larger billed `` recent immigration , '' than that is a fast change for when the idea of evolution is gradual change over a long period of time , unless I misinterpreted it . But then again , I think it 's possible that `` micro-evolution '' does happen in some birds such as finches .

Modern society does not fit well with the society of 2000+ years ago , with their beleifs eroding away those who see themselves primarily as 'American Christians ' may find this involentary loss of beleif as worrying and threatening to the older , more familiar ways .

As we all have seen , creationists ca n't debate if their lives depended on it .

How is that conclusion derived at ? The passage is speaking to the consequences to a man who 's actions cause the death of an unborn child .
Sorry but I think you are mistaken in that the bible `` describes '' dinosaurs . The first description is most certainly a description of the hippopotamus , which were abundant in Egypt , etc . The second seems to be crocodile of some sort . Most likely the Nile crocodile . Tanniyn is not just described as dragon , but also as serpent or scaly creature . At that time there was no other large scaly creature other than the Nile crocodile . They might have been describing a whale , but whales do not have scales . As to your claim of evolution , that depends on what `` God '' would mean by `` create . '' YOU can create something out of something else ca n't you ? So than evolution is a possibility .
Heres a question ; which one split from the other ? Which one is the new being ? None of them are . If I get a cake and slice into two exact pieces , which one is the new slice ? They are both equally new .

But abiogenesis , and so much more of `` science '' attempts to stop religion - attempts to alter the worldview of students .

I wo n't try to explain this , but anybody who has the book can read pages 240-243 to see what marc is once again omitting . Miller continues by explaining that he feels God 's interactions with the world are few and far between because they are strategically placed , and he puts it in a context than any believer has surely heard , believed , and repeated dozens of times : We do n't see huge Godly magic tricks because `` God does n't work that way . '' When I ask for an obvious sign , like my keyboard floating before my eyes , and it does n't happen , the excuse I hear is that `` God does n't work that way . '' Now , all of a sudden , marc has a problem with that explanation . Go figure .

The pistol and hunting rifle is not enough . Please read the 2nd Amendment . It does not mention hunting as a reason for firearm owership or a reason for firearm ownership . What the 2nd Amendment refers to is modern military weapons . So , yes , we 'need ' military weapons . The purpose of the 2nd Amendment is to defend democracy from enemies of democracy who are armed with modern military weapons . The 2nd Amendment does not mean I fight the enemies of democracy with hunting guns . It means I fight back with the same guns they will probably be shooting at ME with .
Even if you want to lump any and all divine intervention under `` creationism '' , disproving evolution would not prove creationism . That 's called a `` false dichotomy '' .

Next theyve trashed Gods creation by diverting everyones attention . Its a subtle move that not many people have noticed . But Ive noticed . What theyve done is a clever sleight-of-hand move . Science no longer looks at animals . They no longer study how organisms interact within their environments . Instead theyve turned everyones attention to genes , bacteria and viruses .and this is because they know full-well that most people know nothing about these things .Thus , they assume ( correctly , unfortunately ) that most people will just take their word for it .

Not like this issue . Moral belief may have been used to justify opposition on civil rights and women 's rights , but I do n't think gay lobbyists realize how much moral belief IS the basis for opposing gay marriage . It 's not the excuse , it 's the reason . There 's a vast difference , and it 's why the public has n't bought into the propaganda that this is just another civil rights issue .

If men fight , and hurt a woman with child , so that she gives birth prematurely , yet no harm follows , he shall surely be punished accordingly as the woman 's husband imposes on him ; and he shall pay as the judges determine . But if any harm follows , then you shall give life for life
Well then this does n't answer my question . If you have 10 doctors for 100 people ( this is just an example ) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $ 100 a year then your health care per capita is $ 10 ( [ 10doctors x $ 100 ] /100 people ) . If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $ 10 per capita as well because you population did not change . Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured : Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country , 2007 & amp ; mdash ; Infoplease.com So again , if you go from $ 6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $ 4,100 per capita then where did that money come from ?

Gun Lobby Promoted `` Final War '' Against Federal Government National Rifle Association ( NRA ) Led Fight , Warning `` Final War Has Begun '' Soldier of Fortune Publisher Robert K. Brown Also Serves on NRA Board of Directors Anti-government writings in Soldier of Fortune magazine regarding the federal government 's 1993 assault on the Branch Davidian compound at Waco being presented during the sentencing portion of the McVeigh trial were only a small sample of the language of war offered by America 's gun lobby to its `` freedom fighters '' prior to the 1995 Oklahoma bombing . In the period leading up to the bombing , violent , written attacks on the federal government were led by the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) , which announced in its magazines that `` The Final War Has Begun . '' Soldier of Fortune publisher Robert K. Brown also serves on the NRA board of directors . McVeigh himself is a former NRA member . Attacks made on the federal government by the NRA in this `` war '' included : In his 1994 book Guns , Crime , and Freedom , NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre compared the final FBI assault on the Branch Davidian compound to the Warsaw Ghetto uprising , stating , `` What occurred is reminiscent of the stand-off at the Warsaw ghetto . The Jews , whose religious views were unpopular with the Nazis , were trapped inside the ghetto and had ten handguns . When the Nazi soldiers tried to take the Jews from the ghetto , shooting started , the soldiers fell back , and the siege began . In the end , the Nazis burned down the ghetto to end the tiring siege . '' An April 1995 American Rifleman article referred to federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms agents as `` armed terrorists '' who are `` harassing , intimidating and hurting honest citizens '' with `` the brute force of unchecked , renegade federal power . '' The article added , `` The terror often comes at the hands of BATF agents clad in ninja black , but the terror does n't stop there . '' Previously in direct mail , Wayne LaPierre had referred to federal agents as `` jack-booted government thugs . '' In the June 1994 American Rifleman , the NRA warned of an alleged gun control `` Master Plan '' that employed the `` the fascist language of Stalin , Hitler , Castro and Saddam Hussein . '' In January 1994 NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre warned , `` We have repeatedly warned this assault was coming , and the time of reckoning is here . If you or your children want to own a gun as free American citizens in the years ahead , then prepare to stand and fight with us now . '' In an October 1993 American Rifleman attack on the Federal Bureau of Investigation which featured goose-stepping military personnel , the NRA asked , `` What 's the first step to a police state ? '' In the ad Wayne LaPierre urged readers to , `` Take back your government and save your guns '' and warned that the FBI 's `` extremist leadership is determined to become a political anti-gun police force . That 's a line they can not cross . The FBI can not be deployed to terrorize honest gun owners ... . '' These and other examples of inflammatory language employed by the NRA in its attack on the federal government found by the Violence Policy Center are available to the news media . VPC Executive Director Josh Sugarmann states , `` Publications like Soldier of Fortune and organizations like the National Rifle Association helped put a violent fringe of American gun owners on a 'war ' footing . Timothy McVeigh was just the first to jump into the breach . '' http : //www.vpc.org/press/9706mcve.htm So someone finally decided to take all that wacko gun nut propaganda seriously and rebel against the government by bombing the federal building .

Why not raise the marginal cost of gun crimes substantially ? Why not make possession of an unregistered firearm , whether one brandishes it or not , a sentence punishable by life in prison ?
There 's also the fact that the police have better things to do than penalize people for something that is n't a crime or a threat to anyone 's safety . Who should law enforcement be targeting more , a dangerous gang with ties to the mexican mafia , or a single mom who forgot about putting her pistol in the safe before going to the grocery store ? Police resources are limited as is . I do n't see why we should be squandering what resources we have , going after people for technical violations rather than true crimes that victimize anyone and everyone . Sex offenders who rape and kill children are required to be photographed and fingerprinted . Why are you in favor of people exercising a constitutional right , being treated in the exact same way ? I ca n't see any type of measurable affect photographing and fingerprinting gun owners would have on fighting crime . We know that criminals wo n't submit to registration , they 're not permitted to own or possess guns under any circumstances , etc . To me this seems more about the regulation of a constitutional right and the harassment of honest gun owners than anything else .

Hi all , I decided to start a thread to see what folks had to say about fossilization . I 'll start by saying that , as I understand it , death is certain and fossilization of the remains is highly uncommon . An animal or plant dies and immediately scavengers , animals plants and bacteria , start the process of reclaiming materials from the carcass . There is very little chance of any part of the organism to be left to fossilize . Unless the carcass was relatively quickly protected from scavenger organisms , there is hardly any chance it will form a fossil . So , maybe most fossils we see are the result of a tragic , untimely death . Is this evidence for the flood ?

It is the secular museums that are not willing to admit their commitment , by faith , to an unproven story of origins . Yet their words betray them . For instance , the Museum of the Earths Guide for Museum Docents repeats the mantra : Questions or debates about evolutionary mechanisms have nothing to do with our confidence in whether evolution occurred.

Oh good grief newbies are all the same on this forum ... Honestly , how many times do you think I 've heard the Exodus and Numbers quote on this forum given my post count and join date ?

You have a simplistic argument going for pot . I ca n't agree that legalizing all drugs would be a good thing either . Programs in Holland have failed to produce significant if any benefits to society in general . The druggies seem to have benefitted by having arrest-free drug zones and access to whatever they want , but the cost of drugs still requires some income , something that most of them likely do not have other than from crime , begging or social programs .

How can so many people be getting murdered every single year if gun control is supposed to save lives in the first place ?

If the solar system was brought about by an accidental collision , then the appearance of organic life on this planet was also an accident , and the whole evolution of Man was an accident too . If so , then all our thought processes are mere accidentsthe accidental by-product of the movement of atoms . And this holds for the materialists and astronomers as well as for anyone else 's . But if their thoughtsi.e . of Materialism and Astronomyare merely accidental by-products , why should we believe them to be true ? I see no reason for believing that one accident should be able to give a correct account of all the other accidents.
This thread has established the cold disregard for undeserved pain and death inflicted upon what would be a child created by the irresponsible acts of humans .

archangelWhen does a human become a person ? At conception .
And this study is just on tadpoles . Does anyone think that this is not a world-wide , creation-wide phenomenon ? Of course it is . Every creature is a product of their environment .

This is not true . The wording is highly misleading , because it implies that according to evolutionary theory there were human-ancestors and chimp-ancestors side by side in the primordial ooze ; there were 'us ' and 'them ' .

I do n't know what to do except try to help you understand better .

A pistol-packing , 80-year-old Bronx man was arrested on gun charges after he tried to turn the tables on a mugger who beat him and stole his Social Security money , authorities said yesterday . Feisty Lester Campbell - a retired security guard who cops said was carrying a hidden , unlicensed .38-caliber handgun - cashed his $ 262 Social Security check near his home on East 139th Street in Mott Haven at 10 a.m. Monday . A husky 6-foot-tall mugger followed him into his building and onto an elevator . As the elevator headed to his floor , the man pounced on Campbell , throwing him to the floor and hitting him in the head and body . As the thug rifled his elderly victim 's pockets for the money , Campbell whipped out his handgun , cops said . His attacker managed to wrest the pistol away and fired a single shot , which lodged in the wall of the elevator . When the elevator stopped , the assailant fled . Cops were called to the building and Campbell told them he had a second gun in his apartment . Campbell was charged with two misdemeanor counts of criminal possession of a weapon . He was treated for facial and body injuries . He didnt have a license . So will Doc Jones tell us that this is substantiated by LAW or does he only say that when he happens to like the law ? He cant have it both ways .

I think that you 're right to point out that both human DNA along with consciousness is necessary since there is life that is conscious but does n't have human DNA ( dogs , cats , etc . ) and there are bodies that have human DNA , yet are dead ( we 're buried with out human DNA intact ) . But I actally disagreewith `` consciousness '' being a necessary quality of `` human beings '' , since it 's unreasonable to believe that we stop being people when we go to sleep . But maybe you have a more nuanced definition of `` consciousness '' . Same as above , do you believe that a person in a coma is no longer a `` Human Being '' ? --

Except that it does nothing of the sort ... But then , what can we expect from somebody citing a website trying to sell you liquid vitamin supplement ... Nevertheless , we look into the Pottenger 's cats claim . Here is a page called , `` Lesson of the Pottenger 's Cats Experiment : cats are not humans . '' Although it 's a page aimed at explaining why this `` experiment '' is not applicable to humans , it exposes the other , erm , flaws in this experiment . The one striking me based on the wikipedia list of diets for the groups should be obvious to everyone : many of these cats were being deprived of protein . This page confirms and elaborates . In fact , its first point is that today 's cats have no problem reproducing for several generations on today 's cooked food . The difference is that good owners do n't feed their pets deficient diets . The real irony here is that this experiment -- were it reliable -- would be the antithesis of supersport 's Lamarckism . In order for supersport to be supported , the cats being fed inadequate diets would re-develop those broken pathways for manufacturing essential amino acids . Obviously , they did not . The only thing we see here is the effect of poor ( i.e . positively malnutritive ) diet . We can conclude that supersport 's Morton 's demon is pretty much in full control . There 's no other explanation for somebody seeing this experiment and thinking it supports Lamarckism , or even counters evolutionary theory , even if he does n't know the basics of experimentation and nutrition .
Have you ever noticed that there are some gay couples that seem to bypass all the hate and ignorance of the anti-gay movement ... couples like Ray Horn and life partner , the guy that was Oprah 's designer and his life mate , and sometimes Ellen Degeneres ?

This post is directed mainly toward men . Women feel free to discuss , but I would like the actual answers to the questions to be from the men . Hitlers or Helpers ? Which one are you ? Hitler defined the Jews as nonhumans , as parasites , so he did execute them . He did . He exercised his freedom of choice , imposed his will upon them , and had them cleaned out from the country . He had them removed , scraped away . A helper is someone who stands alongside another in assistance , and protection . So , which are you ? What kind of a man are you ? Do you have the guts to stand up and defend the weak and helpless ? Or , have you redefined human life so that you can justify killing it ? Do you have the guts to be men and stand for what is right ? Or , is sitting in your couch , watching TV , easier to do than be good men ? Do you have the strength to curtail your own sensual desires ? Or do you seek women for your own pleasure , and then destroy the lives formed in the long because they are inconvenient ? Or , let 's see where you stand ? Are you a Hitler or a helper ? - REAL MEN stand up for the innocent even at the cost of their lives . - REAL MEN do what is right , even when it 's inconvenient . - REAL MEN recognize that there are things greater than themselves , like righteousness , integrity , the need to protect women , the obligation to provide for children , and they live their lives according . - non men get women pregnant after a tryst of satisfying their own desires , and then the emotional burden on the woman to destroy the life within her . - non men advocate killing the weak and defenseless . - non men hide behind the sinful and asinine intellectual arguments of liberals and the ungodly in order to justify the destruction of life so they might be self-assured , and self comforted . - I 'm a real man because I stand against unrighteousness - even when it is extremely difficult . - I 'm a real man because I protect the innocent and the weak . - I 'm a real man because I stand against other males who seek to justify killing the weak and innocent . - I 'm a real man because I advocate the production and preservation of life . - I 'm a real man because I do not set the mother against the child . - I am a real man because I do n't redefine life in emotionally neutral and dry intellectual terms to ease my own conscience . I 'm a helper working against Hitlers !

I do , but it is irrelevant in this instance , imo . The argument addresses reality and women in reality are surprised by their pregnancy if they did not have sex with the intent to become pregnant ( say , a BC failure ) . Perhaps women shouldnt be surprised , but they certainly are in many cases .
They prefer their own pleasurable self-indulgence over the care and sanctity of the life they created .
Natural selection is not proof of evolution by any means .
Here , you claim `` objects without similar characteristics '' , and then you COMPLETELY IGNORE THE SIMILARITY we are talking about in order to focus on a dissimilarity you want to talk about . By that technique , NO analogy would be valid . You could invalidate ANY analogy if all you had to do was point to a difference between the two .
Whacky , But , that 's my point . If the universe were `` plunked '' into existance yesterday , just as it is today , it would still be a day old .

Problem with your logic is thus . Step two is not based on step one . It is a second premise . The fact that a being is all powerful precludes step two . Therefore , contradictory PREMISES . Therefore , fallacy of the inconsitency .

Do n't count on it . The number of scientists in the American scientific community that subscribe to creationism is about % 5 , based upon a relatively recent poll . I will try to dig it up . Also , calling most Kansas residents stupid for voting in Christian Board of Education members is ridiculous . Religious views are almost never even mentioned in local politics . At the most , you see perhaps a flyer that says `` Vote ______ '' . The Christians who want to teach Intelligent Design in schools are an extreme minority that the media , in all its story-searching rating-mongering glory , is blowing out of proportion .
There is quite a bit of debate what the militia can be interpreted as , and individuals ignoring the laws as they see fit is anarchy ( checked out the Free State project , you are a beleiver in Arnacho-captalism or so it seems which is a form of anarchy ) , nothing nessesarily wrong with it though .

In a study funded by the anti-self-defense Joyce Foundation and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) they set out to debunk Lott 's findings regarding the Brady law . There was just one problem : they couldn't. `` http : //rpc.senate.gov/~rpc/releases/1999/gc083100.htm
No . Not in matters of science .
Evolutionists can not support thier theory and expect you to find proof to support yours .
5 ) What experiments have been conducted to verify the occurence of intelligent design ?
I have characterized certain ideas , notions , and opinions as stupid and simple-minded , but not you personally .
Today , no informed creationist would deny natural selection .
Regarding the line to be drawn between valid and invalid medical circumstances , I suspect it is best left to the physician 's who encounter and are familiar with the various causes for concern . I personally know quite little about them . The ones I would categorize as valid would be those that threaten the continued healthy life of the mother in such a way as to include the possibility of her being unable to function as a mother and caretaker of not only the expected child but those she may already be tending . Reduced to a short sentence , the line should be drawn under the doctor 's signature .
I neither believe that `` all life is sacred '' nor that `` god '' or religion should be used in the debate at all .
how do you know you were born heterosexual ? what suggests that you were born with a particular sexual orientation ?
I 've filled marc in on this before , but as usual he 's ignoring the information that he does n't like .
I 've seen that argued throughout these posts , but I do n't think I 've seen the argument from start to finish . As such , I have not been absolutely convinced of this . Do you mind helping me out a little by drawing this argument out in a little more detail ?
The prediction was made based on the mindset that everything evolved from a common ancestor over billions of years . Furthermore , it was based upon the fossil record , which is supposedly shows how everything evolved .
Another question might be , have evolutionists figured out the `` mock '' gene yet ? Mockery was a great ingredient in Christian salvation . Judas mocked Jesus in the garden , the chief priests and scribes laughed him to scorn , Herod mocked him , the servants and the soldiers jeered at him and insulted him , and on the cross all sorts of taunts were thrown at him . I do n't claim to be perfect - mockery could possibly be an effective tool in certain instances , but I may be wrong about that . Is mockery synonymous with evil ? The opposite of love ? Do atheists do it more than Christians ?
Evolution PREDICTS that DNA changes . Not `` assumes '' . But PREDICTS .
So you are saying that because the gun is of value you should just let the burgular take everything else of value , Rape your wife and possibly kill you all because you might get shot ? XXXX . You are now quoting that burgulars will invade homes more because there are guns in there ? Again this is this frauds own personal research to meet his agenda . Please show me his raw data.. otherwise it is XXXX . Your quote starts out with fact ( the 74 % ) then goes off into fantasy land of the quotes of one or two CRIMINALS who support your global socialist agenda and then he does `` his own study '' . XXXX ! GOA and other pro freedom groups footnote and annotate thier sources for your review not some `` oh we looked at the fbi statistics and from `` our own '' research we have found that pistol gripped assault rifles can go on a kill crazy rampage whether or not a human is actually holding the thing '' XXXX ! The latest is the BATFE is XXXXXX at the brady foundation for misrepresenting their data ... hmm ... .. C R A P !
No foundation for Paul allegedly being `` unaware '' of these things .
Fort example , I was talking to an old friend and she told me that something would tell her to go head on with on coming traffic .
Some people do also get a pleasureable effect from shooting guns and using them for such purposes as hunting and target practice .
That 's really all I have to offer to this debate , hopefully somebody will help verify/strengthen my points , seeing as I 'm hardly the expert .
You said that the colour changes are caused by a single gene . This further goes to imply that a mutation could disable the primary gene and activate the recessive gene . This is of course IMHO . What you classify as evolution , I call variation within a kind . You arent working off the big picture idea .
The rise in fresh water entering the Arctic Ocean could change the global distribution of water , the team says . ... .. It could also affect the balance of the climate system itself and even possibly alter the behaviour of the Gulf Stream . Part of the process is likely to mean more precipitation ( hail , rain , sleet and snow ) at higher latitudes , and so more water flowing down the rivers . ... ... If the global water distribution changes , this could have important social and economic consequences . An altered hydrological cycle might conceivably have a profound cooling effect on north-west Europe as well . The American Geophysical Union , publisher of the journal , says : `` It could also alter the balance of the climate system itself , such as the Atlantic thermohaline circulation , a kind of conveyor belt . ... `` It is possible the increase in fresh water entering the Arctic Ocean could contribute to an alteration in the thermohaline circulation , because it is diluting the saltiness of the seawater and reducing its density . ''
Yet there was a case that I read about somewhere , where a sticker was placed in science textbooks advising children to study evolution `` with an open mind '' , and an ACLU lawsuit ensued .

Actually , the Mormon seminaries are n't `` on the grounds , '' although they may be on an adjacent , privately owned piece of property . It would be unconstitutional for the seminaries to be on property owned by the school district . The children go to the seminary on released-time , which has been found to be constitutional ( although I do n't see how ) . Pertinent decisions about religious instruction and schools are : McCollum v. Board of Education ( 333 U.S. 203 ) Zorach v. Clauson ( 343 U.S. 306 ) McCollum found that religious instruction on school property is unconstitutional , while Zorach found that `` accommodating '' religious instruction by releasing students from school for that purpose was not .
The universe-as-computer concept may also play into the current strife about intelligent design . It might be argued that a computer implies a programmer . However , this may be taking the analogy too far . What the universe is computing , in Lloyds picture , is not some external output but rather its own behavior . And a very large portion of its computing power seems to be tied up in such behavior as random collisions of atoms . What a way to spin this . This actually favors ID . If the majority of the computational resources are wasted , it reduces the amount of probabilistic resources . monkeys typing on computers can produce simple code that would generate a wide variety of outputs. Id like to see that . ( Is he trying to make monkeys out of Stephen Wolfram et al ? ) Elsewhere , Seife uses terminology that is likely to create confusion . He posits a possible law of conservation of information ,  without noting that Intelligent Design theorist William Dembski has used the same wording to propose a different law . Seife is referring to [ blah blah blah ] . All of which has nothing to do with Dembskis claim that organisms contain information that could not have been produced naturally . Transparent , intellectually dishonest obfuscation . Comment by j  March 9 , 2006 @ 6:47 am
I wish to wave the flag for the middle ground . I do not believe that the Bible is 100 % accurate historically . I do believe that many events ( including the flood ) happened in some form or other and many of these are long-ago racial memories which may well have been enhanced/distorted/spun over the course of millenia .
no guns , no shootings ! ! Does it get any simpler ?
..a piece of genetic material taken from your own body and inserted into a sterile egg to create a batch of undifferentiated cells to reinsert into your body to save your life ?
Abortion is killing , therefore the choice of : to abort or not abort ? = to kill or not to kill ? What could be simpler , unless you are talking about a different choice ?

Do pro abortion people support euthanasia as a reason for abortion ? Meaning for instance ... if after amniocentesis it is discovered that the child has down syndrome or if it is discovered the child will be born with no legs the previously hoping and willing parents decide to abort for this reason . Do pro abortion people support this ?
It contradicts a literal interpretation of the Bible .

Good questions . I agree that this logic is somewhat flawed ( unless quote mined ) . God could have made Adam and Eve . He could then have planted evidence that life evolved to this point . The miracle could have happened , too , in much the same way .
Does private gun ownership deter crime ?
There is n't . The controversy is over whether it 's man-made or not .

You stated the `` Illiad '' has historical figures . Many writings do . What distingustes the two is that one is fact and the other fiction . Noone claimes that Homer was conducting a documentary of this time and these people .
We are talking about constitutional rights . In that case , even if you want to put religion into the mix . You really ca n't .
Alexander Hamilton 1775 The Sacred Rights of Mankind are not to be rummaged for among old parchment , . or musty records . They are written with a sun beam in whole volume of human nature , by the hand of the divinity itself , and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power . The fact that the Constitution did not include a bill of rights to specifically protect Americans ' hard-won rights sparked the most heated debates during the ratification process . To the Federalists , those who favored the Constitution , a bill of rights was unnecessary because the Federal Government was limited in its powers and could not interfere with the rights of the people or the states ; also , most states had bills of rights . To the Anti-Federalists , those who opposed the Constitution , the prospect of establishing a strong central government without an explicit list of rights guaranteed to the people was unthinkable . Throughout the ratification process , individuals and state ratification conventions called for the adoption of a bill of rights .
If only she 'd been allowed to have a gun she could have what ? Shot or threatened to shoot someone ? `` Boys and girls as young as 10 '' , the story says . They threw `` rocks and eggs '' at her house . They do n't kill you for that in England , Texas maybe .

As I 'm sure you know , the Declaration of Independence states : `` ... all men are created equal , they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . '' Who or what do you consider to be the ( capitalised ) Creator in this text ? More importantly , who do you think the authors of the Declaration considered the Creator to be ? The Declaration certainly seems to tie up the notion of 'inalienable rights ' with religion . No more , I 'm going to bed .
Because Africa is n't one big homogeneous ecosystem . There are jungles , plains , deserts , swamps . Himps living in the jungle were n't in competition with himps that started migrating out onto the plains . Their food sources are different , their territories are different .

U.S . Senator Frank Lautenberg ( D-NJ ) and U.S . Representatives Peter T. King ( R-NY ) have introduced common sense legislation to deny firearms and explosives to terrorists . Currently , federal authorities can not stop sales of guns  including military-style assault weapons  by dealers to known or suspected terrorists . This gap in the law threatens our nation 's safety . A new GAO report finds that , from February 2004 to February 2009 , there were 963 cases in which a known or suspected terrorist attempted to buy a gun . In 90 percent of those cases  a total of 865 times  they were cleared to proceed with that purchase . One of those cases involved the purchase of explosives . Congress must pass the Terror Gap bill to stop known or suspected terrorists from buying guns .
I 'm no slaver but ... All firearm transactions must be through a FFL with a background check . First sale and any subsequent transfers of ownership . No private party to pp sales without FFL oversight . Mandatory theft/loss reporting . Potential jail time for failure to report . Mandatory jail time for filing a false theft report .
What 's the scoop here ?

Good idea simone , when do you start your training . I understand bullet wounds are kind of nasty because they 're deep .

I have some questions for everyone here . For example , what is each side trying to prove ? Are the evolution supporters trying to convince others of evolution , or are they trying to defend evolution ? Are the creationists trying to disprove the current theory of evolution , or are they trying to win converts ? Also , why do you believe what you do about the universe ? ( `` The other side is wrong '' is n't the real reason you to believe what you do , I would think ) Here are my answers : I am here because I enjoy debates , and I am trying to defend evolution from people who do n't understand it . I believe that there is no god because I see no compelling evidence . I was brought up without anyone telling me what to believe , though I went to church occasionally . I also read the bible , but this failed to convince me . Finally , I wonder why the bible has convinced some but not others . I hope this thread proves informative .
To equate miscarriage with manslaughter is preposterous .
Luria-Delbruck experiment ( 1943 ) ( also called the Fluctuation Test ) demonstrates that in bacteria , genetic mutations arise in the absence of selection , rather than being a response to selection . Therefore , Darwin 's theory of natural selection acting on random mutations applies to bacteria as well as to higher organisms . These experiments also introduced the microbiological method of replica plating . Max Delbruck and Salvador Luria won the 1969 Nobel Prize in part for this work . In their experiment , Luria and Delbruck inoculated a small number of bacteria into separate culture tubes . After a period of growth , they plated equal volumes of these separate cultures onto phage ( virus ) containing agar . If virus resistance in bacteria were caused by a spontaneous activation in bacteria , then each plate should contain the same number of resistant colonies . This , however was not what Delbruck and Luria found . Instead , the number of resistant colonies on each plate varied drastically . Luria and Delbruck proposed that these results could be explained by the occurrence of a constant rate of random mutations in each generation of bacteria growing in the initial culture tubes . Delbruck developed a sophisticated mathematical model based on this hypothesis that was entirely consistent with these results . The conclusion was that mutations in bacteria , like higher organisms , are random rather than directed .
Yes , that is the point !

The reason abortion at any stage of a pregnancy is unethical is because you can not justify killing a human life based on its stage of development . I am 18 years old . I am not allowed to gamble or to buy alcohol until I am 21 . This is because studies show that my brain isnt developed enough to way consequences . I am not fully developed yet . This does not make me less human than those who are older than me . This might be alittle out there for some but if you cross the line one day you could be killing babys because they can not walk yet they arent quite human because humans can walk upright . A human is a human no matter what stage of developedment it is in . But I can see how just telling someone that it is just a fetus makes it easier on them . Abortion has its place . In the need where the mothers health is endangered its completely understandable but its not understandable when its done out of convenience .

5 ) Show me one instance of an evolutionist ( any book , any website ) admitting that evolution may not be evolution at all , but simply an individual organisms ability to utilize his genetic diversity and adapt himself to his local environment  that selection may not have anything to do with phenotypic change ... .and instead of vertically , evolution first happens horizontally . ( A trait of a good scientist is to consider opposing viewpoints and alternatives , not to ignore them . )
It was a media circus , and had plenty to do with the establishment clause of the first amendment .

I appreciate that you said that because you are one of the few Creationits who realize that nothing the bible says is completely proven and a fact ... it 's not the infallible word of God ... it 's a book my humans and that IS a fact ... And the examples you gave ( Tower , Noah ) only state that ... I really like your opinion and really appreciate that ...
I 'm not sure what your point is . Are you trying to raise the Hitler question ? Hitler was a Christian and claimed that he was doing his Christian duty . What does any of that have to do with the differential reproductive success of advantageous alleles ? Evolutionary theory is not a moral imperitive . It is an explanation of what is observed in nature .
Actually I have no problem with civil unions as long as civil unions replace the marriage certificate . Besides it will backfire on them the first time some one is denied something because they are n't married and have a civil union this will be back in court .

BANKRUPTCY Medical Bankruptcy : Myth Versus Fact David Dranove and Michael L. Millenson Abstract David Himmelstein and colleagues recently contended that medical problems contribute to 54.5 percent of personal bankruptcies and threaten the solvency of solidly middle-class Americans . They propose comprehensive national health insurance as a solution . A reexamination of their data suggests that medical bills are a contributing factor in just 17 percent of personal bankruptcies and that those affected tend to have incomes closer to poverty level than to middle class . Moreover , for national health insurance to have an impact , it would have to define `` medical '' expenses in a much broader way than is now typical of either private or government-funded plans . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- The great enemy of the truth is very often not the liedeliberate , contrived and dishonestbut the myth : persistent , persuasive and unrealistic . President John F.

Ah good question but there is a difference in topic : The thread you referred to asks : Why does such an all loving and good God create a world with evil ? *But first you must realize it is not myself that claims for God to be good or for the rapists to be evil but rather I am posing the question to those who do claim that God is good and there is evil* This thread asks a similar but not quite the same question . Let me affirm : I do not have a beleif in `` God '' . I do not beleive in good or evil .

What we see throughout the history of the universe is a continuous cycle of things becoming more complex and things of a different nature being created . When you look at humans and apes as being of a different nature , some quantum leap had to have occurred . While the physical ( common usage ) human may have evolved from ape , that essense of what makes humans human occurred in a much different manner . Comparing the DNA of humans and apes tells us nothing about the differences of the two . That which makes humans human does not reside in the physical self , it is of another nature . So the creationist are right in concept at least . In short the limited theory of quantum potential simply contends the nature of our existence is to recognize our potential , to prepare for the next quantum leap . Once that idea is internalized , one can see how limited our current views are .
Here we have a case of an event where we definitely need some objective reporting . I suspect this was simply intended to be a PRIVATE SCREENING of a film . Private screening are extremely common in the film world . The whole idea of a private screening is that ... well , it 's private . Meaning , only some people are allowed to the screening . If they were rejecting people at the door , it was obviously a private screening , so one has to wonder why these guys were trying to get in to begin with if they were n't invited . This does n't sound like a case of anyone trying to bring science in to challenge something , but rather someone trying to crash a private screening of a film . So essentially , someone who 's eager to play the hypocrisy card blogs about trying to sneak into a private screening of a film , but getting kicked out while his celebrity companion managed to get in . Big whoopin ' deal . Since there does n't seem to actually be any objective reporting done on this event , here 's a different blog entry of the event that presents it in a different ( and probably more realistic ) light ... Did Richard Dawkins just crash the party at a screening of Expelled ? Some of the comments in the comments section there also shed light on the incident .

I am a Christian , so I believe that the meaning of life is to be re-acquainted with God and to live your life in according to his Word .

No being Japanese is not a disorder . What you are neglecting is causality of depression and suicide . That is why I mentioned that the high rates can not possibly be attributed to just homosexuals that are ostracized by the religious or openly hostile anti-gay individuals . There must be associative behavior and cause within the community , within these homosexual relationships themselves . Is that caused by homosexual brains ? Unsure . Is it the indivduals themselves and the assosiative issues within the homosexual relationship . Quite likely , but still causality is not 100 % clear . I 'm sure if you delved deeper into the causes of Japanese suicides you would find a myriad of reasons much like any colletive with high suicide rates .

Mutagenesis Is Often Futile Bacterial populations are estimated to spend most of their time under strong growth limitation ( 53 , 55 ) , and many of these stresses can not be relieved by mutation ( e.g. , lack of any carbon source , exposure to extreme physical conditions ) . If mutagenesis were induced by such stresses , it would create deleterious mutations without hope of benefit . A mechanism for stress-induced mutagenesis might be advantageous if cells could determine that ( a ) the problem is solvable by mutation and ( b ) that death is assured if no mutation is forthcoming . Without such prescience , cells with a mechanism for stress-induced mutagenesis would be eliminated by repeated rounds of futile mutagenesis .
You are missing the point . Evolutionists say that certain animals in a population are GENETICALLY superior than others ... .and these genetic superiors are more successful breeders . Do you understand this concept ? So when you say that more humans are born than reproduce , that 's not particularly important because I submit those who go on to reproduce do so mostly because of choice or circumstance -- not because of their GENES . How can you possibly refute this ?
Again , the 14th Amendment just keeps any state from depriving anyone of liberty -- it does n't DEFINE that liberty .
I think a more telling question would be , why the hell would you rather feel constantly threatened than feel safe ?
And would n't it be great that rather than giving the same old canned responses that are based in the same old false assumptions , and the mocking insults toward me , that your side actually dealt with the questions asked . Only then , with objective and serious consideration will you evos realize how you have been duped by scientific gibberish and pseudo intellectual psycho babble that lead very simple people into thinking that with such big words and so scientific a vocabulary , the lie of evo must be at least based in truth . I submit to you that nothing could be further from the truth .
All you have to do is look at nature : Lions and hyenas and buffalo and crocodiles and fish and ants and bees and lots of other animals work TOGETHER . They work in teams .

Well here is an example of guns and lies . I am a law abiding citizen with a valide carry permit . I am going through a very bad divorce . My wife is on drugs and I 'm trying to get full custody of our daughter . Well she did n't like the idea too well so her and her father lied to the police and took a warrant out on me for aggravated assault . They said I put my hand on my gun and made a threat ( which I never did ) . They seized my gun and arrested me . Well several months later I 'm still awaiting trial on a hear say case with no evidence ! ! ! Its stories like this that makes me sick ! People being arrested for crimes they did n't commit and there rights being taken away over some petty high school BS ! Where are the laws to protect the innocent from people like them ?
If you personally choose to live your life in accordance to the bible , that 's fine . But the Bible , like many other foreign documents , has no place in politics . Religious influence in government is highly un-American .

It is these kinds of articles that are so transparently silly that really irritate me .
In discussions in this forum , I have found that a key differentiator between pro-life and pro-choice proponents is their approach to morality . Pro-life proponents tend to ultimately have a morality based on moral proclamations - religious or otherwise - that can not be questioned and need no supporting arguement . The proclamation `` All human life is sacred '' is the main one which leads to their pro-life stance .
In reality , those who are retarded can do nothing normal , including drive , eat , use the restroom , etc. , without assistance . To call someone retarded , thats not , is common , but shows lack of character . You evidently have no loved ones that are mentally disabled . Its a low blow , IMO . I know theres an explanation for everything , thats why God isnt praised as much as He should be . I tend to thank Him for all things . Its a habit of mine . I just thought that Id throw in my 2 cents worth . No harm intended .
Yes , but ... Sotomayor is a very strict legal beagle . Had I the best sort of law degree from the best university , I would very much fear to take her on in the field of established law . She observes the law down to the last dot , dash and comma . However ... while the right to choose is still a part of established law , the radical and experimental present Supreme Court does not hesitate in the least to legislate new law and new meanings to law . Were Sotomayor to be persuaded by the Roman Catholic cabal of the U.S. Supreme Court that the Court should take it upon itself to rewrite Roe v. Wade , she might join in with the legislative five to make a new and more restrictive law regarding abortion .
here we go Dan . your problem with the law is not whether its fair or not , its whether you can benefit personally from it . you have no problem with abortion because your not going to be the victim of such a law , but youd definitely have a problem if you were the one suffering from the law . Apparently you dont care if the law disadvantages or is unfair to others , as long as it does n't hurt you , you 're OK with it . More evidence of your selfish motives , which is not necessarily a bad thing , but it sort of disqualifies you from being objective and reasonable about the abortion issue . Its obvious if you were in the fetus ' position , you 'd be against abortion . I seem to detect a lot of abiguity and contraction on where you stand on this
Ok , so you are admitting that the unborn fetus , is in fact , a child ? I have to believe that is what you mean from your statement above . That being the case , do you condone the killing of a child that is born but will likely live in poverty the rest of his or her life ? Do you condone the killing of a handicapped child that is born ? If not , then you ca n't condone abortion . Also , who gives you the right to decide what is best for a child by killing him or her ? That should not be your choice ( this is another problem with humanism , because there is no moral authority to stop people from doing whatever they want to do , hence the adage that humanism is a philosophy that has both feet planted firmly in mid-air ) . I am sure the child would n't agree to that choice if given a voice to do so .

Not exactly the same news . Back in 2006 he wanted to buy up a bunch of stock and then dump it to drive down the price , in some sort of attempt to `` punish '' Microsoft . Now it seems he wants Christians to buy and keep the stock , so as to sway votes at shareholders meetings . Of course , either course of action is ludicrous . There 's no way these people have the money to steer the course of a corprate giant like Microsoft . I 'm perfectly happy to see this church blowing its money this way , but it 's a shame about the followers of the church , who may well not really have the spare cash to risk in this sort of endeavor .
This sentence is so badly constructed as to be nigh impossible to parse , and so I have no clear idea of what it is supposed to mean ... .
Except that that would be the author 's words , not a direct quote . Notice the absence of quotation marks ? Special Agent Newell never said `` 17 % came from the US '' . The author has as much trouble with the stats as you . 17 % of the total have been traced to the US . We do n't know the percentage of the total that did indeed come from the US but is untraced or untraceable . See the difference ?
An example , consider the cold environment mentioned above . We take a population of both long , short and medium , haired dogs to this environment . Over time , very short time , the population will only consist of the long haired dogs as the short and medium haired dogs would freeze and be wiped out by the cold conditions .

Frankly , it just means it will go to the supreme court , which everybody pretty much expected already . They are n't even allowing gay marriages to happen in the meantime , because he also issued a stay . Of course in the long run this does n't play well to liberals because with the SCOTUS they wo n't have their usual strategic luxury of a single individual sharing their ideology wielding such far-reaching power .
`` I Do n't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist '' is a book out by Norman L. Geisler and Frank Turek After listing a series of embarrassing gaffes of the apostles , Geisler and Turek ask the reader , `` If you were a New Testament writer , would you include these embarrassing details if you were making up a story ? Would you write that one of your primary leaders was called 'Satan ' by Jesus , denied the Lord three times , hid during the crucifixion , and was later corrected on a theological issue ?
AMD4EVER , thank you for your reply . Does your nickname suggest you do n't like Intel ? Just wondering .
I have never received an actual explanation for the doctrine of eternal damnation from anyone I 've asked . It is something I struggled with before turning to Atheism , something I tried desperately to rationalize , and was one of the main points that LED to me becoming Atheist Many Christians claim that their God is omnipotent/omniscient . They claim that their God is a god of compassion , love , and mercy . Yet , with all of this , they claim that God punishes all people who do not accept Jesus as their savior with eternal torment in Hell , i.e . the vast majority of mankind numbering into the billions . What possible compassionate purpose can infinite torture have ? The punishment does n't even serve a remedial purpose because the tormented one is not allowed to repent . It 's only conceivable purpose ( to me at least ) is sadism . How is this not evil ? This thread is especially so I can her the thoughts of Christians on this and how they rationalize it , but anyone can feel free to chime in with observations , etc .

Much debate has been given to the second amendment , but what do these four words inparticular really mean . They are saying that individuals have the right to `` own '' arms , and that individuals also have the right to `` bear '' arms . But what does bear mean , it means that you have the right to keep a firearm on or about your person at any time you so choose to . Furthermore , I have found nowhere in the constitution where we are limited to `` certain types '' of firearms . I currently am awaiting the arrival of my ccl , but is it truly constitutionaly legal for me to even have to have a licsense to carry my handgun , concealed or open either one . Does the constitution state when and where you can carry a handgun , or a long gun as well . We , as lawfull gun owners , need to start making our voices heard in regards to flimsy gun control measures that you and I both know is only going to affect us . Courts are still going to make plea bargains , criminals are still going to only do a small portion of their sentences , and criminals are still going to walk free due to a minor technicality , and criminals are still going to have guns . So where does all this leave us as lawfull gun owners , it leaves us holding the short end of the stick . And if we dont all pull togeather , the anti-gun crown is going to eventually get their way on this . It is up to us as lawfull gun owners to see to it that we do not loose a right we all hold so close to our hearts .
I think when trying to prove the xistance of god , you are in a similar situation . You can not see god , you can not measure him , though some claim they can feel his presence . Personally , I believe in god , and I feel a little sorry for those who do n't . Faith in something bigger than yourself , bigger than all mankind , can give you something to hold onto when there seems to be nothing else . Personally , I believe in god because sometimes he talks to me . It is like a little voice in the back of your head that gives you nudges inthe right direction ( sometimes the voice is not so little ) . Maybe I am schizo . Maybe it is my subconscious . Personally , I believ it is god . I have never gone wrong heeding that little voice , though I have often walked right into a heap of trouble when I have ignored it . Anyway , that is my proof . I do n't expect it to convince anybody but me , but there it is .
I know Christians that believe in evolution , but i dont know atheists that believe in creationism .

Once again , my point was that evolutionists contradict each other .

Pro-choice advocates believe that there is nothing immoral about abortion . They maintain that having an abortion is not murder . If this is the case , then it can not be immoral for me to tell a person that I wish they had been aborted . After all , I am not wishing death upon them , but only nonexistence . Wishing death would be immoral , because it would be wishing something bad upon a person , but wishing they had never been born can not be immoral , because according to abortion advocates , there is nothing bad about not being born . If , however , it is in fact immoral to wish a person had never been born , then by the same logic abortion must also be immoral . Why , then , do we generally feel that I wish you had never been born is such an awful thing to tell a person ? The answer speaks for itself . Well , pro-choicers , I wish all of you had never been born . And if my account is banned for that statement , its simply proof that the moderators here are pro-life . In addition , if you are offended by it , it is proof that deep down , you are , too .
Yet to the woman the fetus is nothing more then cancer . The fetus is in her body and still should remain HER choice . Until someone comes up with a way for a fetus to live outside the body , without help , then it is nothing more then cancer and a parasite on the womans body . How about a compromise on this issue MEN should not have a say or decision about abortion and we all leave any legal desions to women . Since this is a womans issue let them decide and males but out .

Washington ( CNN ) -- Nearly 180 Department of Homeland Security weapons were lost -- some falling into the hands of criminals -- after officers left them in restrooms , vehicles and other public places , according to an inspector general report . The officers , with Customs and Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement , `` did not always sufficiently safeguard their firearms and , as a result , lost a significant number of firearms '' between fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2008 , the report said . In all , 243 firearms were lost in both agencies during that period , according to the January report from Inspector General Richard Skinner . Of those , 36 were lost because of circumstances beyond officers ' control -- for instance , ICE lost a firearm during an assault on an officer . Another 28 were lost even though officers had stored them in lockboxes or safes . But 74 percent , or 179 guns , were lost `` because officers did not properly secure them , '' the report said . Following a review of the draft report in December , Homeland Security took steps to implement its recommendations and overhaul its property management policy , according to a response in the report . A department spokeswoman did not immediately return a call from CNN Thursday seeking comment . The report concluded the department did not have specific procedures and policies in place regarding firearms . `` Instead , DHS relied on its components to augment its general property management policies and procedures with specific guidance for safeguarding and controlling firearms , '' it said . `` Although some component policies and procedures for safeguarding firearms were sufficient , personnel did not always follow them . '' The inspector general cited several examples of `` inappropriate practices . '' A customs officer , for instance , left a firearm in an idling vehicle in the parking lot of a convenience store . The vehicle was stolen while the officer was inside . `` A local law enforcement officer later recovered the firearm from a suspected gang member and drug smuggler , '' the report said . In addition , an ICE officer left an M-4 rifle and a shotgun unsecured in a closet at his home . Both weapons were stolen in a burglary and later recovered from a felon , according to the report . Another officer left his firearm in the restroom of a fast-food restaurant , and it was gone when he returned . `` Other CBP and ICE officers left firearms in places such as a fast food restaurant parking lot , a bowling alley and a clothing store , '' the report said . `` Although our review focused on CBP and ICE , other components described similar incidents . For example , a TSA officer left a firearm in a lunch box on the front seat of an unlocked vehicle ; the officer realized the firearm was stolen when he returned to the vehicle two days later , '' said the report . `` Officers may have prevented many of these losses had they exercised reasonable care when storing their weapons . '' Of the 179 lost because of laxity , 120 were reported stolen and 59 as lost , the report said . That resulted from the agencies ' lack of guidance on a standard method for classifying and reporting lost firearms , as well as `` a common perception among officers that reporting a stolen firearm was more acceptable than reporting a lost firearm . `` Although CBP and ICE reported 120 firearms as stolen , our analysis showed that these firearms were lost ( stolen ) because officers left the firearms unsecured , '' according to the report . `` All 179 losses may have been prevented had the officers properly secured their firearms . '' The department had about 188,500 weapons in its inventory as of last summer , the report said . The majority are assigned to Customs and Border Protection and ICE officers , but others are carried by agencies including the U.S. Coast Guard , the U.S. Secret Service and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center .

The partial birth abortion is rare , but it is not always used to save the mother 's life . At any rate , I may seem radical , but even if it is to save the mother 's life I think it should be disallowed , as it is a very cruel preocedure . Would you do that to a born baby ? Of course not . It 's very sickening that the so called `` land of the free '' would allow such a murderous procedure to be done .

Anti-abortion legislation is simply a tool by which they try to maintain a less sexually permissive society , believing that if women who fall pregnant outside of marriage are forced to endure pregnancy and likely child-raising alone , rather than being offered an easy way out , they will be less likely to have sex outside of marriage .

In a strictly biological sense , there is no debate that the biological life of a mammal begins at the point of conception/fertilization . There is no reasonable dispute to this observed fact . Only when subjective terms such as 'self-awareness ' and 'personhood , ' etc . come into play can there be valid debates . Show me a biologist or embryologist who states that the biological development of a unique mammal does not begin at conception/fertilization , and I 'll show you a semantics game .

There IS an intrinsic , inherent item of biological evolution that IS N'T scientifically valid and that could well be responsible over time for the eugenic-mess we 've seen over the years . Evolutionary theory itself preaches and teaches No-Teleology-No-Conscious-Forethought .

Challenged by Creationists , Museums Answer Back By CORNELIA DEAN Published : September 20 , 2005 ITHACA , N.Y. - Lenore Durkee , a retired biology professor , was volunteering as a docent at the Museum of the Earth here when she was confronted by a group of seven or eight people , creationists eager to challenge the museum exhibitions on evolution . They peppered Dr. Durkee with questions about everything from techniques for dating fossils to the second law of thermodynamics , their queries coming so thick and fast that she found it hard to reply . After about 45 minutes , `` I told them I needed to take a break , '' she recalled . `` My mouth was dry . '' That encounter and others like it provided the impetus for a training session here in August . Dr. Durkee and scores of other volunteers and staff members from the museum and elsewhere crowded into a meeting room to hear advice from the museum director , Warren D. Allmon , on ways to deal with visitors who reject settled precepts of science on religious grounds . Similar efforts are under way or planned around the country as science museums and other institutions struggle to contend with challenges to the theory of evolution that they say are growing common and sometimes aggressive . One company , called B.C . Tours `` because we are biblically correct , '' even offers escorted visits to the Denver Museum of Science and Nature . Participants hear creationists ' explanations for the exhibitions . So officials like Judy Diamond , curator of public programs at the University of Nebraska State Museum in Lincoln , are trying to meet such challenges head-on . Dr. Diamond is working on evolution exhibitions financed by the National Science Foundation that will go on long-term display at six museums of natural history from Minnesota to Texas . The program includes training for docents and staff members . `` The goal is to understand the controversies , so that people are better able to handle them as they come up , '' she said . `` Museums , as a field , have recognized we need to take a more proactive role in evolution education . '' Dr. Allmon , who directs the Paleontological Research Institution , an affiliate of Cornell University , began the training session here in September with statistics from Gallup Polls : 54 percent of Americans do not believe that human beings evolved from earlier species , and although almost half believe that Darwin has been proved right , slightly more disagree . `` Just telling them they are wrong is not going to be effective , '' he said . Instead , he told the volunteers that when they encounter religious fundamentalists they should emphasize that science museums live by the rules of science . They seek answers in nature to questions about nature , they look for explanations that can be tested by experiment and observation in the material world , and they understand that all scientific knowledge is provisional - capable of being overturned when better answers are discovered . `` Is it against all religion ? '' he asked . `` No . But it is against some religions . '' There is more than one type of creationist , he said : `` thinking creationists who want to know answers , and they are willing to listen , even if they go away unconvinced '' and `` people who for whatever reason are here to bother you , to trap you , to bludgeon you . '' Those were the type of people who confronted Dr. Durkee , a former biology professor at Grinnell College in Iowa . The encounter left her discouraged . `` It is no wonder that many biologists will simply refuse to debate creationists or I.D.ers , '' she said , using the abbreviation for intelligent design , a cousin of creationism . `` It is as if they are n't listening . '' Dr. Allmon says even trained scientists like Dr. Durkee can benefit from explicit advice about dealing with religious challenges to science exhibitions . `` There is an art , a script that is very , very helpful , '' he said . A pamphlet handed out at the training session provides information on the scientific method , the theory of evolution and other basic information . It offers suggestions on replying to frequently raised challenges like `` Is there lots of evidence against evolution ? '' ( The answer begins , simply , `` No . '' ) When talking to visitors about evolution , the pamphlet advises , `` do n't avoid using the word . '' Rehearse answers to frequently asked questions , because `` you 'll be more comfortable when you sound like you know what you 're talking about . '' Dr. Allmon told his audience to `` be firm and clear , not defensive . '' The pamphlet says that if all else fails , and docents find themselves in an unpleasant confrontation , they excuse themselves by saying , `` I have to go to the restroom . '' Eugenie C. Scott , who directs the National Center for Science Education and is conducting training sessions for Dr. Diamond 's program , said that within the last year or so efforts to train museum personnel and volunteers on evolution and related topics had substantially increased . `` This seems to be a cottage industry now , '' Dr. Scott said . Robert M. West , a paleontologist and former science museum director who is now a consultant to museums , said several institutions were intensifying the docents ' training `` so they are comfortable with the concepts , not just the material but the intellectual , philosophical background - and they know their administrations are going to support them if someone criticizes them . '' At the Denver science museum , the staff and docents often encounter groups from B.C . Tours , which for 15 years has offered tours of the museum based on literal readings of the Bible . The group embraces young-earth creationism , the view that the earth and its plants , animals and people were created in a matter of days a few thousand years ago . `` We present both sides from an objective perspective and let the students decide for themselves , '' said Rusty Carter , an operator of the group . Mr. Carter praised the museum , saying it had been `` very professional and accommodating , even though they do not support us . '' A typical group might have 30 or 40 people , he added . Kirk Johnson , a paleontologist who is the chief curator at the museum , was philosophical about the group . `` It 's interesting to walk along with them , '' he said . Participants pay the admission fee and have as much right as anyone else to be in the museum , Dr. Johnson said , but sometimes `` we have to restrain our docents from interacting with them . '' John G. West , a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute , whose researchers endorse intelligent design , said he was not aware of organized efforts to challenge museum exhibitions on evolution . He added , `` It is not unheard of for museum exhibits to be wrong scientifically . '' Dr. Scott , who trained as a physical anthropologist , said that in training docents she emphasized `` how the public understands or misunderstands evolution and some of the misconceptions they come in with . '' She hopes to combat the idea that people must choose between science and faith - `` that you are either a good Christian creationist or an evil atheist evolutionist . '' `` It 's your job , '' she told docents , `` not to slam the door in the face of a believer . '' At the American Museum of Natural History , which is about to open what it describes as `` the most in-depth exhibition ever '' on Darwin and his work , curators and other staff members instruct volunteer `` explainers '' on the science behind its exhibitions , according to Stephen Reichl , a spokesman . If visitors challenge the presentations , the explainers are instructed to listen `` and then explain the science and the evidence . '' Sarah Fiorello , an environmental educator at the Finger Lakes State Parks Region who took part in the Ithaca training session in August , said she was now prepared to take the same approach . When she describes the region 's geological history on tours of its gorges , visitors often object - as even a member of her family once did - that `` it does not say that in the Bible . '' Now , she said , she will tell them , `` The landscape tells a story based on geological events , based on science . '' Dr. Durkee also said she found the session helpful . `` When you are in a museum , you ca n't antagonize people , '' she said . `` Your job is to help them , to explain your point of view , but respect theirs . `` I like the idea of stressing that this is a science museum , and we deal with matters of science . ''
During the debates on the adoption of the Constitution , its opponents repeatedly charged that the Constitution as drafted would open the way to tyranny by the central government . Fresh in their minds was the memory of the British violation of civil rights before and during the Revolution . They demanded a `` bill of rights '' that would spell out the immunities of individual citizens . Several state conventions in their formal ratification of the Constitution asked for such amendments ; others ratified the Constitution with the understanding that the amendments would be offered .
No , but my wife is .
Let 's not deal with assumptions , Monty , although I do n't think that 's the word you mean . Cite precisely where Dembski has published an application of his explanatory filter which has detected design in nature . Let 's progress from you referring to a second hand report to the actual published paper .
** Here you reveal exactly what I 've just spoken of -- you assume that science and the scientific method equates to , is synonymous with , materialism/mechanism . I science which does not strictly adhere to materialust/mechanist assumptions , is not , and can not be , real science . Equally untrue .
Precisely , if a master craftsman destroys his finest creation because it is flawed , is he doing something wrong ? Or is n't it his right to do what he wishes with his creation . So it is with the maker of all that is . So they may seem like terrible acts from your VERY LIMITED PERSPECTIVE , but from the perspective of a perfect and holy God , His judgement was a righteous one on all levels . But why would one expect you to get that ?

If God is all-powerful , then His words should be all that 's needed . To me , the world is proof that God is all-powerful . The beauty and complexity is just staggering .

Also another example put forward is a bacteria that can only sustain itself by eating Nylon . The theory goes - nylon is a recent invention therefore this bacteria must have eolved recently . What it suggests however is that a portion of an existing population would have died if not for nylon ... the bug has to have nylon , or it will die . It is akin to looking at a portion of the human population who would die from heart-trouble . But thankfully we 've now got artificial hearts , therefore this portion can survive . They are not a new species of human , but live only because of a recent invention .
Other apes can also be taught these same concepts - to a more limited degree , sure , but then the related parts of their brain are smaller and less capable .
This theory is made up of nothing more than the imaginings of a young cosmologist back in 1929 yet has been adopted as a rational theory by the scientific community as if they are a bunch of lemmings who will grasp at any explanation which does n't claim that God did it .
Also , a fetus is n't a child . A child can live without it 's mother . A fetus can not . We do n't see a fetus as a parasite , but that essentially what it is ... ..
I have never said that we should punish 12 year old orphans . Show me where I said that . I said that the parents should help raise the child if they have the means . Would that put a slight damper on the 12 year olds social life ? Probably , but she will be an adult soon enough and she should take some responsibility for her actions . The father should have to do the same . Why do you admit that the actions of the 25 year old are tragic but you do n't want her to take responsibility ?
Ok according to the bible God only created the first two beings , Adam and Eve . Now christians dont rule out science , and science has shown that we produce offspring . God has created these offspring but not directly . Think of photosynthesis , we eat meat , this is getting energy from the sun indirectly . So we have shown that we ourselves produce offspring but we are put here and given the abbility by God to produce offspring . As far as your question on why God alows addicts to have babies it can be explained as this . We where given the freedome of choice to decide if we want to be an addict , wrong put we have the choice . God created us to have that choice , or else we would be robots . The bible also says God knows everything yet to come , so he new that this particular person would become an addict and have baby . God can stop this put he doesnt interecpt dirrectly with our choices .
i worry that the same law makers who push for registration are the same ones who want to ban all guns . for an example `` If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban , picking up every one of them , Mr. and Mrs. America , turn them all in , I would have done it . '' -Senator Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif , discussing the 1994 `` crime bill '' ,

my contention is that there is a `` you '' or `` me '' on the inside ( some call it a ghost in the machine ) who 's in charge of creating and manipulating the physical machinery . Of course this is unprovable , but fits in nicely with the idea that `` I '' am a reality . If `` I '' was merely a result of a combination of electrical connections in my brain , then `` I '' would n't really exist ... . '' I '' would just be an illusion . You are entitled to you opinion . However there are no facts to back you up - that of course is your usual failing in constructing an argument . You are engaging in the Brain-Room fallacy illustrated in the movie All You Wanted To Know About Sex etc . There is no you in charge up there , just the body and the brain . Its all physical and chemical . No spirit no `` operator '' no holy ghost in the machine . Indeed there is some evidence that `` you '' are a creation of the brain for purposes of rationalization rather than `` you '' actually making the decisions of everyday life . Look up the work of Libet .
You could n't be more wrong . Public TV programs , educational policy statements , and science textbooks have asserted that Darwins theory of evolution fully explains the complexity of living things . The public has been assured , most recently by spokespersons for PBSs Evolution series , that all known scientific evidence supports [ Darwinian ] evolution as does virtually every reputable scientist in the world. The following scientists dispute the first claim and stand as living testimony in contradiction to the second . There is scientific dissent to Darwinism . It deserves to be heard .

i will pray for you all right now
There 's no mention of gays in the constitution . Our agenda is incorporation and equal treatment . What 's yours ? You seem to forget we already tried this standard . And it 's for this reason that the 14th Amendment came into existence ; because allowing local communities to disregard the constitution on the basis that it did n't apply to them , was a massive failure and outright racist .
Ha ! Brady is so ignorant he 's blindly repeating the greatest statistic that points out the fallacy of his argument that you can find . You heard it ! Straight from the mouth of Brady ! Only 151 killings since 2007 ! He does n't even mention how many of these were considered justifiable cases of self-defense ! Just `` killings '' period . So , what he 's saying is : In four years there have only been 151 lives taken by licenced CCW permit holders . Considering the number of folks posessing a CCW , and the number of killings that have happened in four years ... ... ... .. ... ... the result is a shocking .00000005 thousandths of a percentage point of total killings by CCW holders compared with killings by NON CCW holders ! It seems like the hundreds of thousands of killings by NON CCW HOLDERS make the measly amount of killings by CCW holders pale in comparison . For example : Brady needs four years of data to come up with 151 `` killings '' ( counting justified cases of self defense , as well ) . You only need the data for 2008 to find that over 180 children under 5 years old were killed by drowning in 5 gallon buckets . Soooooo ... ... ..using the data provided by Brady we can determine with absolute certainty that : CCW holders are so safe , your child is more likely to be killed by a 5 gallon bucket within 365 days than a CCW holder in four years ! Yet , when compared to non CCW holders , we 're in deep trouble ! Since 2007 , NON CCW HOLDERS HAVE COMMITTED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MURDERS ! Yet , in four years , Brady can only find 151 by CCW holders . Some of those 151 are even cases of justifiable self defense ! Keep up the good work pointing out how safe the percentages are , Brady ! I could n't do a better job of pointing out how CCW holders are so safe , they 're only responsible for .00005 thousandths of a percent of killings compared with NON CCW holders , myself ! Maybe they should change their name to `` Brady Campaign to Prevent Bucket Drownings '' . They would save more lives in one year than in four spent chasing CCW holders .
You 're an XXXXX who has obviously never worked ina first responder category . If you think that increasing the volume and social acceptance of drug use to the same level of alcohol will 'solve ' anything , then you are just an XXXXX . You have obviously never seen whart drug abuse does to families and people 's lives . You 're right , alcohol is worse , and the main reason its worse is because of 2 reasons , volume and availability ala social acceptance . Legalizing all drugs would have catastrophic social impacts . Do n't feed me that line about taxing it and using the money for rehab . We have taxed the XXXX out of tobacco and alcohol the last 100 years and the last time I checked alcoholism and lung cancer had n't been erradicated .
Because every creationist I have seen on this board has used the creationist definition of evolution which non-creationists flatly reject and it wastes time .
Pity you know so little about biology . The difference between pygmy and taller races is probably just a handful of control genes or DNA sequences relating to the control of growth of body parts . Even in non-African populations , you can get dwarves and giants based on differences in single proteins .
i believe you just get angry when soemone does n't agree with you 100 % .
Unaware of what are state and federal laws , and now unaware of the liberal party 's own message .
we simply do not evolve , there is no scientific proof just ideas which change from day to day that also explain our siciety today .
... .that would probably help me make quite popular , which would help me reproduce ... .however this trait has not arisen yet ... .why not ?
And it is much easier to have an abortion than to be a mother .
Not all women are the same . And , your attitude is very offensive if you believe that all women must carry an enormous burden of guilt if they have an abortion .

Pointing out some of the achievements of science which could not have been accomplished in any other way , is not `` raising science on a pedestal '' - it 's merely reciting the obvious .

`` If the Founding Fathers could read the Ninth Circuit 's opinion , they would be cheering , '' said Mr. Henigan . `` By so forcefully challenging the perversion of the Second Amendment by those who seek to dismantle our gun laws , the Court has honored the Framers and their Constitution . ''
No one wants to take your `` marriage '' away Matt . It 's a free country -- no one 's going to block your way to any chapel that will marry you . Do your gay thing . But let marriage be marriage -- it 's a different matter . People just want to keep you from tampering with the institution of marriage .
I do not understand why the same people who claim that the government is incopetent and inefficient are afraid that the public option will outcompete the insurance copanies and put them out of business .
That 's stupid ( and totally inaccurate ) . But I will say one thing - I would make partial birth abortion a federal crime with the death penalty for whoever performs one . And I 'd make their executions public and put them on pay TV , and use the proceeds to fund homes for unwed mothers , etc . Those late-term abortion butchers are the most despicable individuals known to mankind , and they deserve what they get .
I 'm talking about `` evolution '' as defined by creationists . That includes abiogenesis and the big bang . I have attempted to show that these theories require fewer assumptions and are therefore more likely to be right .
Life begins at the point of conception . No one can deny that after a human being is conceived it will develop into the very same being as those debating this issue .
Why Tester , do n't you point out his straw-man which this thread is based upon ?
Based on threads I 've been reading here , there is a real tendency among some of the pro-choicers to portray pregnancy as a horrible thing that cause women to suffer -- that it is somthing bad or undesirable . - How could the opportunity to bring a life into the world , a wonderful miracle , be so awful by default ? Rather than bring into this peripheral thoughts to the question , such as rights and legal issues ( which are discussed at length here already in other threads ) , I 'd love to hear straightforward relelvant answers to this . I am also already aware that pregnancy can sometimes involve complications or that it can at times cause financial constraints . But I am mainly interested in seeing why there is a default tendency in pro-choice arguments to argue from the standpoint of pregnancy being a bad thing . Any thoughts ?
You assume that the majority want gays to enjoy those same benefits . That 's a big assumption .
Would you have supported the `` freedom '' for Hitler and his cronies to own guns in 1932 ? Mao in 1947-48 ? Because those freedoms directly led to the abrogation of the ultimate right -- the right to life -- for at least 30 million people . Gun control is NOT about a government trying to disarm a people so that government can be tyrannical .
One question I would like to get answered is should the US have an amendment against adultery ? I think this dose a lot more harm to the sanctity and value of marriage Just had to put in my $ .02 , and would you all let me know if there is ever a good answer ?
I refer you back to the first question . What caused the light sensitive cells to develop in the first place ? Answering 'evolution ' is just circular logic . Was nature able to see far enough into the future and know that developing light sensitive cells would eventually lead to the eye ?
you notice evolution never definite ages . they say from 5million to 35 million . they never are sure . wan na know why cause its A LIE . ITS FAKE . NOT TRUE . ALL CRAZY MAD SCIENTISTS WITH NOTHING BETTER TO DO !
I would disagree here about this , in terms of the pro-life view . It 's not that mental existence is irrelevant ... quite the contrary ; in fact it 's the reality that there will SOON be mental existence that makes it matter . I do n't think the issue of abortion should ever be divorced from the reality that the embryo will likely grow into a human being ... a human that is human by pretty much anyone 's standards . So I suspect that the big difference here is that pro-choicers are more `` in the moment '' in terms of the way they view the fetus , and pro-lifers are more `` long-term bigger-picture '' in terms of the way they view the fetus . Certainly the likely potential of what the fetus grows into has a lot to do with the pro-life position on whether it is truly human .
The only question would be is it harmful or exploitive to the one being manipulated ? If so , how can we tell ?
read previous posts , i was commenting on another comment .
And it also took an amendment to give the slaves rights , not a judge .
In a proper debate the parties make belief statements with support . In the secound part you both ask examining questions of each others belief . In the thrid part you both address those questions .

It is impossible for mankind to alter God 's plan . That would make man more powerful than God . Everything that happens is part of God 's plan , which is why it is so difficult for me to believe in God . Why would God create man , give them free will , then punish those who actually exercise their free will and choose not to believe in God ?
I did not come on here to talk about Dr. Lipton 's spiritual beliefs . My OP is about how evolutionists have developed a whole theory based on the fraudulent premise that genes control everything . How many times have you head `` it 's in the genes '' ? But how can genes control anything if they do n't even control the cell they reside in ?

Actually , there are two color morphs in arctic foxes that are determined by a single locus . You are incorrect to claim that the brown morph becomes pure white . That is incorrect . Oh ? http : //www.anwr.org/gallery/images/08-Arctic % 20Fox.jpg That looks pretty darn white to me .
I feel that I must point out that , in the past , you have argued that gays can get many of the rights that straights get from marriage by going to a lawyer and getting the proper papers drawn up . I trust you have changed your opinion on that now ?
In anthropology and biology , the term Evolutionism is nowadays used specifically for historical theories or beliefs of early sociocultural evolutionism developed in the 18th and 19th century that organisms are intrinsically bound to improve themselves through progressive changes that are heritable . This idea was applied to cultures and societies as well as to living organisms . The term evolutionist is still used more widely and can refer to proponents of the theory of evolution through natural selection which has superseded the earlier biological theories , but particularly in the U.S.A. this term is used by opponents of the theory to bolster their claim that evolution theory is a belief , or ideology ( compared with other ideological `` isms '' ) , rather than a science . The term is rarely used in the scientific community , as evolution is overwhelmingly accepted there . The terms are still used for theories about the development of cultures and civilisations .
If abortion is made illegal I predict that you will see across the border abortion clinics , in canada and states that still premit abortion . Are we to fill the prisons with those seeking abortions in places where it is legal if they live in states that do not allow abortions ? Prolifers better becare for what they wish for . Prolifers tend to be conservative and do not like taxes . They better get ready to pay , in taxes , for the extra prisons and social programs needed for all those abandoned children .
and there is really little ( if any ) common intellectual ground on which Creationism and Scientific Materialism can meet .
To be constantly told I 've been defeated by pseudo intellectuals who constantly claim victories when there is absolutely nothing to be gained from debating here shows just how lacking of any actual intelligence you people possess . But you sure feel smart after patting each other on your sanctimonious backs after convincing yourselves that what you know is actually correct when it is no more correct in reality than your warped and very corrupted World views . I will proudly stand alone against your combined self perceived intellect , and most importantly , I will confidently place my beliefs against yours at the end of this life when the true answers to the questions we debate will finally be known . And at that time , this ignorant christian will be standing tall in his knowledge as you all regret everything you have ever believed in your lives .
If you were trying to use that to counter my point , it failed . Anecdotal evidence does n't affect statistical probability - that there was a single event says nothing about which is generally better .
I was n't oversimplifying anything , only stating the obvious in that a whack job intent on murdering people can do it very effectively without a gun . But by disarming honest people as you would do , you insure that criminals who have no respect for the law will remain the only people armed in our society once the law abiding people willingly give theirs up . That will be a time to truly worry about our personal safety since we all know the police only respond to crimes committed but ca n't prevent crime from occurring as it 's happening since most violent crimes take place in private settings . You anti-second amendment mooks simplify the issue by thinking that disarming good people who own weapons will somehow change the nature of all men . If you look at the rates of violent crimes in nations with stricter gun laws you will see that on a per capita basis violent crimes are just as high as they are here . It 's just that more people die from stabbings and beatings than do here . But when all is said and done , dead is dead is dead .
The N.O.W . ( NAGS ) are a bunch of hypocrites anyway . You hardly ever see them stand up for women if it 's a conservative woman under attack . And they support the infanticide of the unborn under the guise of women 's health care , which is something only spiritually-dead imbeciles do . NOW deserves whatever they get .
... however I do believe that anything that 's called a `` fact '' should be testable and/or observable
And what type of objectivist views do you have toward gay issues if I may ask ? I 'm assuming gay issues may seem irrelevant since they probably do n't pertain to you well , cause your not gay ... .
Dude , it 's , like , all over the Bible , man ! Maybe if you hit your forehead with Bibles more often , you would know these things !
Research Shows Gay Marriage Reduces VD An associate professor in the Department of Economics at Swarthmore College has written a paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research that shows how in Europe , where same-sex relationships have been granted legal recognition since 1989 ( beginning in Denmark ) , there is a correlation between same-sex marriage ( or civil unions ) and a decline in the rate of at least one sexually transmitted disease , syphilis . In `` Forsaking All Others ? The Effects of 'Gay Marriage ' on Risky Sex , '' Thomas S. Dee writes : One of the conjectured benefits of establishing the legal recognition of same sex partnerships is that it would promote a culture of responsibility and commitment among homosexuals . A specific implication of this claim is that gay marriage will reduce the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections ( STI ) . In this study , I present a simple 2-period model , which provides a framework for discussing the ways in which gay marriage might reduce ( or increase ) the prevalence of STI . Then , I present reduced-form empirical evidence on whether gay marriage has actually reduced STI rates . These evaluations are based on country-level panel data from Europe , where nations began introducing national recognition of same-sex partnerships in 1989 . The results suggest that these gay marriage laws led to statistically significant reductions in syphilis rates . However , these effects were smaller and statistically imprecise with respect to gonorrhea and HIV . [ from the paper 's abstract ] Professor Dee is no neophyte or quirky economist working on a pet project . He has contributed articles to numerous academic journals and chapters to several books , including No Child Left Behind ? : The Politics and Practice of School Accountability , Developments in School Finance , and An Economic Analysis of Risky Behavior Among Youths . Dee 's concluding paragraph suggests the impact on both the U.S. economy and public health that could ensue from legalizing gay relationships : These results suggest that gay marriage might reduce , perhaps dramatically , the social costs associated with STI like syphilis . In the United States , over 34,000 cases of 25 syphilis were reported in 2003 ( CDC 2004b ) . And the direct and indirect annual costs of syphilis have been estimated at nearly $ 1 billion , which reflects in large part , the role that syphilis plays in spreading HIV ( CDC 1999 ) . However , the policy relevance of these results probably extends beyond the issue of improvements in public health . For many who are debating the desirability of gay marriage , these results may be more important because of what they suggest about the likely effects of gay marriage on the degree of personal commitment in same-sex relationships . The full paper provides extensive economic analysis , including charts and graphs , and is worth reading for all those concerned about the prospect of equal-marriage rights in the United States -- whether proponents or opponents of the concept . http : //ricksincerethoughts.blogspot ... .educes-vd.html
Is n't it amazing how quickly creationists will accept natural selection and superfast evolution when it supports they 're beliefs ?
This is also a highly controversial issue , and it is not right to forcibly subject a minor to the political views of her parents
And what about the four year old boy who was denied flight because his name was also on the watch list ? Because his name was the alias of a known terrorist .
The word `` evolution '' has such a broad meaning that it does n't have to mean atheism , but it since it is practically the only weapon that atheists have to combat the religious worldview , that 's what it often DOES mean .
OHHHHH I do send me please I love to see men in kilts the hairier the better
When I watch the news , and see someone interviewed , I 'm always mildly irritated by the little caption they attach : `` Joe Bloggs , smoker '' ; `` Jane Middlemiss , motorist '' - like these titles somehow define the person . Stenger is a person , who has personally come to certain conclusions by using his brain and the scientific method . I 'm quite sure he is convinced by the evidence supporting evolution - so what ? So 's Jyoshu .
So montalban . Why do n't you tell us about creationism . What is the theory ? What is the evidence ? What predictions can be made . We can assume that since you have n't responded to previous requests that there is no theory and no evidence . It is only superstition based on childish mythology .

But what I do know for certain is that evolution , abiogenisis , and the assumptions made by Geologists about the age of the Earth and biologists about macro-evolution is very wrong and unreliable . That much I do know and can not compromise on .
It begins to look , then , that this is a piece of crude propaganda ( see note below ) , deliberately manipulated to give the false impression that the fact of evolution is seriously under scientific question , and that the fanciful notions of creation `scientists ' are contributing to that debate .
I enjoy written debates very much , and I 'm trying to show how evolution can establish atheism in the U.S. government ...

Historically , the causes and origins of crime have been the subjects of investigation by many disciplines . Some factors that are known to affect the volume and type of crime occurring from place to place are : Population density and degree of urbanization . Variations in composition of the population , particularly youth concentration . Stability of population with respect to residents ' mobility , commutingXpatterns , and transient factors . Modes of transportation and highway system . Economic conditions , including median income , poverty level , and job availability . Cultural factors and educational , recreational , and religious characteristics . Family conditions with respect to divorce and family cohesiveness . Climate . Effective strength of law enforcement agencies . Administrative and investigative emphases of law enforcement . Policies of other components of the criminal justice system ( i.e. , prosecutorial , judicial , correctional , and probational ) . Citizens ' attitudes toward crime . Crime reporting practices of the citizenry .
I am not calling anyone on this board or any other specific evolutionist a racist .
I am even prohibited by law from performing a background check .
From my speculation , this topic is full of people trying to either prove or disprove evolution . Almost no one ever tries to give evidence against creation . So , what is it ?
May I ask what you mean when you say Who is God ?
Since you scoff at the idea that the laws that govern energy and matter must coincide with the formation of energy and matter , tell me this , which did God create first , the laws or energy and matter ?
And im not really sure what a `` pregnancy '' is according to you.. please explain.. When i hear the word pregnant , i think of 2 people , not just 1 .
See above . A lock can create doubt about the ease of entry into a residence . Many criminals move from door to door until they find one that is unlocked , rather than drawing undue attention by smashing one in .
I 'm not saying parents should have control over the kids life , but when they are children , they should guide them . Some kids go through school , and do n't know anything about god , at all .
So gun owners are being discriminated for `` who they are . '' I guess you could put it that way . You could also say that violent killers and serial rapists are being discriminated against for `` who they are . '' By the way , I support gay marriage but do n't support the mayor 's actions .
To sacrifice the life of a mother in that situation to the life of a fertilized egg , an embryo , a fetus , is a heinous , anti-life crime .
how about a Swiss University ? they have full automatic weapons in most homes , and target shooting is a national sport .

First of all the evidence fits perfectly with that book you speak of . If predicts that all creatures came about suddenly and completely formed . This is all we have ever observed .
However Christian theology and history have disproven this time and time again . In fact , Christianity 's supposed stance against abortion is only very recent . For hundreds of years Christianity openly supported abortion before quickening . It is a dirty little secret that the ideological masters of the Christian-Con movement hope you never find out about because it would destroy them .
`` It seems to me that with all the mortals throughout the world , including the Pope , praying fervently for the life of Terri Schiavo to be saved , the Bible God , to whom they were praying , should have intervened . ... ... For instance in Matthew 21:21-22 , the author quotes Jesus , aka God , as saying , `` I tell you the truth ... If you believe , you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer . '' Then in Mark 11:23-24 , the author quotes Jesus again saying , `` I tell you the truth , ... whatever you ask for in prayer , believe that you have received it , and it will be yours . '' If those quotes were correct and Jesus , aka God , was telling the truth , it begs a very important question : was not a single one of those who prayed worthy of having his or her prayer answered ? It 's frightening to think the Pope would not be considered worthy enough to have his prayers answered , but apparently , according to Jesus , aka God , and providing the quotes were translated correctly , he was not . '' ( Harold R. Larimer , Where was Jesus , aka God ? , American Atheist Newsletter , July 2005 , p5 )
This belief is based upon a common pro-choice interpretation of the 14th amendment . Some say that these rights include the right to choose to abort a pregnancy . They say that this right is afforded under the 14th amendment ( ie : ... nor shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ... ) . It is applied to say that a woman has a right to do what she wishes with her bodily resources .
See , here you 've seperated mind , spirit , soul . The bible did n't do this , unless Zechariah is being misinterpreted . It basically said , in your interpretation , that the spirit and the soul are the same thing .

Hear my words i hate liberals and i will never change my mind about abortion . I try to love everyone but it 's hard for me to love somebody who kills and innocent child .
It becomes somewhat irritating to deal with people who 's ignorance is matched only by their arrogance . Election day saw a sweeping repudiation of legally sanctioned same sex marriage in 11 different states , including relatively progressive Oregon . This follows similiar votes for amendments defining marriage in California and Missouri . What does this all mean ? Well , for starters , it indicates that a federal marriage amendment has a fighting chance . It should remind us that sanctioning gay nuptials has n't one thing to do with the oval office occupant . It is well known , or should be known , that the process for amending the constitution does not involve the President . The Amendment Process There are essentially two ways spelled out in the Constitution for how it can be amended . One has never been used . The first method is for a bill to pass both halves of the legislature , by a two-thirds majority in each . Once the bill has passed both houses , it goes on to the states . This is the route taken by all current amendments . Because of some long outstanding amendments , such as the 27th , Congress will normally put a time limit ( typically seven years ) for the bill to be approved as an amendment ( for example , see the 21st and 22nd ) . The second method prescribed is for a Constitutional Convention to be called by two-thirds of the legislatures of the States , and for that Convention to propose one or more amendments . These amendments are then sent to the states to be approved by three-fourths of the legislatures or conventions . This route has never been taken , and there is discussion in political science circles about just how such a convention would be convened , and what kind of changes it would bring about . Regardless of which of the two proposal routes is taken , the amendment must be approved by three-fourths of states . The amendment as passed may specify whether the bill must be passed by the state legislatures or by a state convention . See the Ratification Convention Page for a discussion of the make up of a convention . Amendments are sent to the legislatures of the states by default . Only one amendment , the 21st , specified a convention . In any case , passage by the legislature or convention is by simple majority . It is interesting to note that at no point does the President have a role in the formal amendment process ( though he would be free to make his opinion known ) . He can not veto an amendment proposal , nor a ratification . In spite of this , opponents of a marriage amendment acted as if defeating Bush would spell the death of such a proposal . Apparently , it 's easier to identify a single scapegoat or hold up an unworthy strawman for condemnation than it is to recognize that there is an overriding public sentiment against alternative lifestyles being officially sanctioned .
Pro-choice at least lets people decide what is best from them and the child . Can you honestly say it is better for a child to be born and mistreated and/or under fed until it dies than it is for a child to simply be aborted ?
I know an atheist who is far more logical than anyone else I 've heard to date .

I 'm confused . What exactly is the difference between a civil union and a marriage . From what I have found , they are identical with the exception of one is religious and the other secular . Is there a larger legal difference ?
I agree , no oath should be taken lightly . However , I believe that a certain amount of interpretation is essential , especially in grey areas that medicine can wander into . Abortion to save the life of the mother is a grey area that doctors have to wrestle with . Separating siamese twins where there is only one heart , allowing one to live while the other dies instead of both dying is a grey area . Following an oath such as that to the letter puts things too much in black and white , when a lot of good medicine happens in the shades of grey .
Why do Americans want so many guns ? What are you most afraid of ?
LOL , so much for the expanded claims of training in order to exercise an inalienable right . First the gun grabbers claim guns are complex and require `` training '' and on the other hand demonstrate that they are so simple to operate that untrained creatures like dogs and snakes can operate them just fine .
Ten gunned down in southern Alabama . At least seventeen gunned down in Germany . On Monday , March 9 , 2009 , some twenty-seven human beings were living , breathing , going about their respective businesses . They are no more .
There 's an abortion pill ?
Hey Sarge , add Democratic on their , and it could be called the DPRK ; its kinda going that way anyhow.People start calling it that now , they will fall in line faster .
In point of fact , the low birth rate in most of Europe is not due to the availablity of abortion , but to good sex education and the ready availablity of effective contraception to everyone who needs it . See this study , for instance : http : //www.advocatesforyouth.org/PUB ... heet/fsest.htm People have small families because they want small families . In point of fact , the abortion rate in Europe is generally much lower than the rate in the US , due , again , to education and contraception . Would you force folks to have children they do n't want ?
A bump of the topic . It seems that any evolutionist with any knowledge of this topic has either quit this board or been banned . Yet there is no response by creationists . Why is that ? Is it that Garioch is correct ? Is it that creationists are making assertions without understanding what they are talking about ? If creationists are talking from a position of knowledge then there should be a creationist discussion of gastralia , their relative position to the sternum , the ossification of the sternum , the presence of a carina , and so forth . The continued failure of creationists to respond with intelligent discussion demonstrates their ignorance of the topic . Therefore , any creationist assertions of the status of Archaeopteryx must be considered as unfounded .
... .Expelled frequently repeats that design-based explanations ( not to mention religious ones ) are `` forbidden '' by `` big science . '' It never explains why , however . Evolution and the rest of `` big science '' are just described as having an atheistic preference .
Really ? The Republicans have just discovered that 80 % of hip replacements are done through Medicare and that the waiting time is much shorter than in Canada .
We saw this in the recent Supreme Court decision . They chose to focus a lot on the role handguns could play in defending house and home against criminals , but seemed to have no problem with a ban on machine guns- the kind of guns that would logically seem to be most protected by the Second Amendment because of their usefulness in military conflicts which would make them a better deterrent against tyranny than other types of firearms . Thus , the Supreme Court chose to `` strain at a gnat and swallow a camel '' to use a Biblical idiom in their treatment of the Second Amendment .

A majority of New York City voters would support a law allowing gay marriage
Ahh ... There you have it . Restrict ammo , not guns . Would be a far more succesful way of enforcing gun-control .
No , it tests whether he is all-powerful . The proof shows that the very notion of all-powerfulness leads to other notions that are absurd , such as the unbreakable rock or , someone else posted , the round square . This is called `` reduction to the absurd '' and it is a valid logical method . It has been used to prove that 1/0 is undefinable . I stated that he can not do something inside of his own nature , that is , his nature doubles back on itself and is contradictory . Similarly if someone spoke of something that is `` both green and not green at the same time and in the same sense '' I can disprove this statement using the Law of Non Contradiction . Of course , one can pull off the rubbish argument that `` it is incomprehensible , therefore it is true . '' As I stated earler , such an argument is fallacious .
Archie 's projection complex strikes again ! Pretty much , we can take whatever Archie says and know that the truth is the precise opposite .
If anyone was going to use the argument that our bodies are flawed to prove that God does n't exist , that would be a debate that could be won . No one would debate that our bodies were made all that well although it is amazing that life could have started at just a single cell and worked it 's way up to where it is today . So either God did a poor job or evolution did an absolutely spectacular job . Just how did evolution know that light existed and that it could be seen before creating the eye ? How do we know that there are not many other senses that exist which evolution will show us one day ?
I went from pro-life to pro-choice .
Similarly , every mutation that has ever occurred has had a definite proximate cause , and if we knew what they all were and what they would all be in the future , evolution would lie mapped out before us in all its detail . Nevertheless , in the absence of perfect knowledge of these individual causes we can still describe the occurrence of such events statistically , saying how long we might have to wait , or how many trials we might conduct in order to expect a given outcome . So to say that the evolution of the nylon bug , for instance , was based on chance is misleading : the evolution of the nylon bug was based on whatever proximate cause shuffled its DNA .
If you think that just as many people die from stabbing and beatings in other developed nations as people die from guns in the US then you need to do more research .
There is evidence , however the battle really boils down to the real battle .
I have a hard time believing a 1 day old baby can live independently

Though people may want to win out in a job interview over someone more qualified , most do n't morally expect that that should happen since they realize that that expectation would not be fair . They may make a buck off of a person but , unless they are con artists who lie to get that buck , most will do it in a way they consider fair , under laws they themselves would be willing to live under .
You missed the whole point of my story . I was not disgusted at the poor people I was disgusted at the government under a socialist mindset . I love poor people , heck I was one for a while ( and really kinda still am ) .
This crushes ToE at the most fundamental level . I 've been telling this board for months that the gene is not the player in biological change that everyone thinks it is . The popultion has been told for decades that they are simply a culmination of their genes .
We might add that the inability of neo-Darwinists , including Dawkins himself , to imagine how an organism could inherit traits acquired through life-struggle doesnt mean they arent picked up nonetheless .
No ... .. I do n't like it . Marriage is a specially protected government institution for a reason ... ... . namely that the family unit is the backbone of society . Redefining this government institution means weakening society as a whole .
Which is also true after ANY cell division of any kind , and as such again is a rather meaningless point .
None that prove one became another . Of course dinos , birds , and fish exist and scientist study them -or their remains as with dinos .
Upon just a quick glance you can tell this person is simply a human being .
2 ) Would you agree that the violinst argument only parallels abortion if we assume that the donor only needs to be connected for nine months , and no longer ?
i too ( like you ) wasted much time reading the bible and devoting my life to `` god '' . i started questioning early ( about 6th grade ) . i came to realize that most of the things i learned in my christian school were false .
All living systems appear to have some limited choice about how to respond . They respond in ways that are only statistically predictable .
Why do you quote the Bible anyways if you can not even stand up to debate the arguments against it ? The Biblical Failures post shows enough reasons to just throw out the Bible as a reliable source IMO .
By the way - you keep making yourself look , well , stupid when you opost these breathless diatribes while not having even a basic understanding of the material . As shown already on one of the other forums where you posted this .

Well , of course the issue is n't `` limiting '' marriage , but rather making it more open-ended . But again , either way , it 'll be a moot point before too long .
GEOCHEMISTRY : Dating Service Radiocarbon dating is the preeminent method for determining the age of carbonaceous materials younger than about 50,000 years . The determination of accurate calendar ages from radiocarbon ages requires a calibration curve , though , because the production of 14C and its distribution between atmospheric , oceanic , and terrestrial carbon reservoirs both vary with time . Charged with the task of producing the official calibration curve for terrestrial radiocarbon dating , the IntCal working group has just released the latest version , IntCal04 . Reimer et al . present this new curve , which replaces the previous version that has been in effect since 1998 . IntCal04 extends the calibration backward by 2000 years , to 26,000 calendar years before the present ( cal yr B.P. , where the present is defined as 1950 ) , increases the resolution of the period earlier than 11,400 cal yr B.P. , and considers the uncertainty in both the calendar age and the 14C age in the calibration . Tree ring data contribute the bulk of the ages in the interval between today and 12,400 cal yr B.P. , and marine data from corals and foraminifera provide the calibration for samples older than 12,400 years . Associated papers in the same issue describe the details of this impressive and valuable achievement . -- HJS Radiocarbon 46 , 1029 ( 2005 ) .
( 1 ) Evolution supposedly explains the `` creation '' of all things in terms of present processes , but the first law of thermodynamics says that nothing is now being `` created . ''
This is where some will deny the OT as an anachronism and only refer to the New Commandment and New Covenant . Of course , by that reasoning - unless selective - Genesis and creation also are anachronisms .
I got a good idea . however , they do tend to stay with their own .
He didnt have a license . So will Doc Jones tell us that this is substantiated by LAW so thats that or does he only say that when he happens to like the law ? He cant have it both ways .
For me , this is like the idea that the speed of light was once very fast and has now slowed down . Both ideas indirectly call god a liar . This is bad .
This is a good site , but very atheist I think . Do you know of a good theistic equivalent ? I do not mean like those awful websites that misrepresent science to try and shoehorn the world into their Bible stories ( sorry to pick on Christians here , but it is Christian ones that I notice ) , but ones that look at real science and look to see if a theistic explaination works for things ?

So that no girl , underage or otherwise , refuses to seek treatment for fear of what their parents will think or say . If a girl can not be tested for a STD without parental notification and she does not wish her parents to know she had sex ( or fears their wrath ) , she may not go in for testing . In general , knowing whether you have a STD is a good thing .
In a socialist nation , the government issues identity cards to all its citizens , to ensure `` national security '' . Anyone suspected of wrongdoing can more easily be rounded up and imprisoned than in a free society . In a socialist nation , the government is the most important entity in determining whether an individual or group of individuals is prosperous or not , if a business is suspected of having links to terrorism , abortion , islam or political opponents , funding can be cut , ensuring high moral standards are maintained throughout the land . In a socialist nation , the government funds schools and determines their curriculum - ensuring that all students learn the appropriate facts rather than controversial theories , ensuring the stability of the governing regime . In a socialist regime the head of state is held to be deserving of respect and admiration from his subjects , ensuring a stable rule - those opposing actions taken by the government are regarded as `` unpatriotic '' and `` appeasers '' . In this way it is easy for a socialist nation to wage war and ensure foreign nations have friendly governments , where a less socialist government may not have the funding to maintain a high-tech global police force .

How do atheists account for the laws of logic in a universe without God ? The Laws of logic are conceptual by nature and absolute . Being absolute they transcend space and time . They are not the properties of the physical universe ( since they are conceptual ) or of people ( since people contradict each other , which would mean they were n't absolute ) . So , how do they account for them ? Examples of logical absolutes are : something can not be itself and not itself at the same time ( Law of non contradiction ) . A thing is what it is ( Law of identity ) . A statement is either true or false ( Law of excluded middle ) . These are simple , absolute logical absolutes . How can absolute , conceptual , abstract laws be derived from a universe of matter , energy and motion ? In other words , how can an atheist with a naturalistic presupposition account for the existence of logical absolutes when logical absolutes are conceptual by nature and not physical , energy , or motion ?
also your `` science '' is scissors , glue , and tape .
And do n't you find it significant that a gun , a symbol and tool of violence , can raise levels of testosterone ?
Okay , heres the hypothesis I pulled out of my rear . Long ago , some females began to wear primordial shoes . The newly evolved shoe-wearing gene was selected for , as females with leather booties were less likely to cut their feet and acquire a deadly infection . This prolonged lifespan set up a selective pressure to develop a shoe fetish among males . Males who became attracted to the booties would be at an advantage , as they would more likely impregnate the bootie women who in turn would be more likely to survive to take care of their sperm products .
I do n't know if it will be found unconstitutional , but there is an effort to simply get it repealed . Same effect in the end . Oh , and congrats !
The terrorists saw it as absolutly necessary . Personally , I disagree . When we kill children in Iraq , we see it as absolutly necessary , call it a horrible side effect of war . I disagree on that , too , I do n't think it is necessary at all .
These so-called pro-lifers do n't care if women die because of forced pregnancies .
I like your thinking , although I disagree with it . You say that God is the universe . I propose that God is relational . That without a relational god we are truly hopeless . The problem you are running into is that you are trying to imagine god existing within the framework of creation ( universe etc . ) and tying his existence to that . NOw I am going to say something that will really not make sense to you . God existed BEFORE time . Chew on that one a bit . Eternality implies an existence outside of time . And in fact , much of science alludes to this possibility . I certainly could never prove it and do not propose to but would like it if you would consider the implications . As for God communicating to us , there is nothing that prevents that . Especially if you accept the idea that we are imago dei , image bearers of the divine . We are not perfect images but we are rational , emotional , spiritual , beings EF

`` And if your right hand causes you to sin , cut it off and throw it away . It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell . '' ( Mathew 5:30 ) Do you actually believe that Jesus wants us to cut off our right hand if it causes us to sin ?

4 . By RUTH FADEN , ANNE DRAPKIN LYERLY and MAGGIE LITTLE WHEN diseases like swine flu hit , pregnant women are especially at risk . And yet we know surprisingly little about how to treat them . In its guidelines for the antiviral drugs Tamiflu and Relenza , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that pregnant women infected or at high risk for infection should take the recommended adult dosage : Pregnancy should not be considered a contraindication to taking the drugs , because the benefits of treatment likely outweigh the theoretical risks of antiviral use. But we dont know whether this is true . Concerns about the ethics of performing drug studies on pregnant women mean we know far less about how to treat them . It is perfectly possible that the standard adult dose of antivirals will not work in the pregnant body . Pregnancy acts as a wild card when it comes to medication . Changes in blood flow , digestion , kidney function and enzymatic activity alter the ways that drugs act on the body . There is almost no data on how antivirals function during pregnancy , and the same is true for many other drugs on the market . The consequences are potentially profound . One of the antibiotics used for treating exposure to anthrax is metabolized so quickly by the pregnant body that no dose , no matter how large , is likely to be effective . If the threat of widespread anthrax attacks after 9/11 had been realized , pregnant women and their babies would have faced disastrous consequences . We should not make the same mistake in planning for the possible reemergence of swine flu in the fall . One pregnant woman in America has already died from the flu . Although other health problems complicated her illness , her death is a reminder that we need to understand how to medicate mothers-to-be . Research should be done now , while pregnant women are already taking antivirals . Studying blood samples from as few as two dozen women would get us a long way toward determining whether the standard dose is effective .
I think you have your image of an assault weapon slightly skewed . an assault weapon by its very name is a weapon designed to harm another human . this does not mean full auto it just means that it was never designed to be a target/hunting/self defense weapon .

So another physician has been murdered for making it possible for women to actually use their constitutional right to choose an abortion . All honor to Dr. George Tiller , who joins the list of martyrs for ethical decency and human rights , killed for healing with compassion . He is a religious martyr in the fullest classical sense , killed in his own church as he arrived to worship , killed for acting in accord with his religious commitments and his moral and ethical choices . And all dishonor to those vicious attackers like Bill O'Reilly who have egged on the kind of violence that finally murdered Dr. Tiller . And who have blasphemously invoked the name of God to justify these incitements to murder .

Wow ! Can you imagine that ? A study affiliated by the NRLC also just happens to support their platform position concerning the number of illegal abortions . What a favorable coincidence ! It does n't even tell you how it was done . However every statistic concerning the number of illegal abortions being performed within the millions to hundreds of thousands come from people not affiliated within either movement . They were observations and studies done on the forefront ; doctors treating post-abortive women from complications .

There is nothing inherently irrational about the theory of evolution being used to explain life in the physical universe , yet creation begins with an irrational premise , that we can `` know '' about the `` unknowable '' .
Those that believe in a right to ones own body have only one logical conclusion for this .
I think the semi-tragic error supersport - and other strongly religious people - make when triumphantly posting links like this is that he assumes everyone invests their beliefs concerning the universe with the same degree of emotion and self-worth as he does . This assumption is explicitly stated on occasion , whenever 'darwinism ' or evolution or some other scientific field of study is described as a 'religion ' . To SS , the most unpleasant and unwelcome thing imaginable is for evidence to be presented that contradicts ones beliefs . The idea that someone could respond to an upheaval or revolution in our understanding with excitement , anticipation or delight is entirely foreign to him .

I do n't believe it is DrNo , because by its very definition evolution claims that Man evolved from the lower animals . It relegates us to nothing more than a biological organism with no more value than an viral bacteria . Another problem you run into regarding Genesis is the spiritual relationship Man has with God and Adams fall from grace . Evolution erases that relationship which erases the need for the need for being reunited with God through the shed blood of Christ on the Cross . Also , you must redefine what evolution teaches altogether in order to credit God with original creation and then assume evolution is His plan for humanity . That 's why the evolutionists are rejecting your premise out of hand . Your version of it is a sacrilege because it goes from being Natural to Supernatural if God is credited with original Creation . One must not compromise what the bible says in order to find a happy medium with the worlds philosophies . That is folly and will only lead to confusion . What you should ask yourself is why are beasts which can only be described as dinosaurs be found mentioned in the bible ? How did Ancient , so called stone aged men describe living creatures at the time , in their world which evolutionists will tell you were extinct for at least 60 million years by then , only 6,000 to 10,000 years ago ? Here 's what I mean . Behemoth has the following attributes according to Job 40:15-24 It eats grass like an ox. It moves his tail like a cedar. ( In Hebrew , this literally reads , he lets hang his tail like a cedar. ) Its bones are like beams of bronze , His ribs like bars of iron. He is the first of the ways of God. He lies under the lotus trees , In a covert of reeds and marsh. Job 40:15-24 ( New International Version ) 15 `` Look at the behemoth , [ a ] which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox . 16 What strength he has in his loins , what power in the muscles of his belly ! 17 His tail [ b ] sways like a cedar ; the sinews of his thighs are close-knit . 18 His bones are tubes of bronze , his limbs like rods of iron . 19 He ranks first among the works of God , yet his Maker can approach him with his sword . 20 The hills bring him their produce , and all the wild animals play nearby . 21 Under the lotus plants he lies , hidden among the reeds in the marsh . 22 The lotuses conceal him in their shadow ; the poplars by the stream surround him . 23 When the river rages , he is not alarmed ; he is secure , though the Jordan should surge against his mouth . 24 Can anyone capture him by the eyes , [ c ] or trap him and pierce his nose ? Leviathan has the following attributes according to Job chapter 41 , Psalm 104:25,26 and Isaiah 27:1 . This is only a partial listingjust enough to make the point . No one is so fierce that he would dare stir him up. Who can open the doors of his face , with his terrible teeth all around ?  His rows of scales are his pride , shut up tightly as with a seal ; one is so near another that no air can come between them ; they are joined one to another , they stick together and can not be parted. His sneezings flash forth light , and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning . Out of his mouth go burning lights ; sparks of fire shoot out . Smoke goes out of his nostrils , as from a boiling pot and burning rushes . His breath kindles coals , and a flame goes out of his mouth. Though the sword reaches him , it can not avail ; nor does spear , dart , or javelin . He regards iron as straw , and bronze as rotten wood . The arrow can not make him flee ; slingstones become like stubble to him . Darts are regarded as straw ; he laughs at the threat of javelins. On earth there is nothing like him , which is made without fear. Leviathan played in the great and wide sea ( a paraphrase of Psalm 104 verses 25 and 26get the exact sense by reading them yourself ) . Leviathan is a reptile [ a ] that is in the sea. ( Isaiah 27:1 ) [ a ] Note : The word translated reptile here is the Hebrew word tanniyn . This shows that Leviathan was also a tanniyn ( dragon ) . Job 41:18-21 18 By his exhaling a light does shine , and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning . 19 Out of his mouth go burning lamps , and sparks of fire leap out . 20 Out of his nostrils goes smoke , as out of a seething pot or caldron . 21 His breath kindles coals , and a flame goes out of his mouth . Isa 27:1 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent , even leviathan that crooked serpent ; and he shall slay the dragon that [ is ] in the sea . How do we rationally explain these creatures existence so recently in our human history if they were extinct for millions of years ? And if they were the imaginings of bronze age sheep herders as your atheists/evolutionists would have you believe , then how did these ignorant people describe creatures we can now recognize from fossil evidence ? And while your at it , ask yourself if it 's reasonable that the bones of dead creatures have survived from 60 million years to some estimated to be more than 200 million years without becoming dust ? Does that make rational sense to you ? Just look at the egyptian embalming methods for preserving the Pharaohs . They are still a marvel to modern scientists yet they are nothing more than frail shells no more solid than the texture of a bees nest after a short 3000 to 4000 years in a dry and sealed sarcophagus . Yet bones/fossils buried in the Earth with the upheavals , alkalis and acids in the earth in addition to the weather have survived over 60 million years ? You must ask yourself if sciences explanations pass the smell test in the realm of common sense . And that decision is yours alone .

But I am not about to take the side of a rapist ... I do n't care how abused they were . When I said that the woman would be reliving the rape , I did n't mean that they would n't otherwise ... but think if you were a woman and were raped , and became pregnant by someone you did n't know or know anything about ... As for the murder part of it , what is it called when anti-abortionists picket outside clinics and shoot and kill the abortion doctors ? Is that not murder ? Does n't that make them hypocrites ?

Published on Monday , November 16 , 2009 by The Alburquerque Journal Health Deform by Carol Miller A very complex , mandatory private insurance scheme recently passed the U.S. House . The public is being overwhelmed by sound bites on one hand about how great it is , on the other , how terrible . We are hearing few of the details that are actually in the bill . Having read the bill , it is clear now that what started as health reform has emerged from the political process as health `` deform , '' building on the worst , not the best of the current system . It is still a toss-up as to whether the Senate will pass any bill this year . However , due to intense political pressure , the Senate is likely to pass a bill that will make some House provisions better and others worse . What actually comes out in the final conference-committee bill is anyone 's guess at this point - so little time , so many deals still to be made , so many political funders to be appeased . A careful analysis of the bill shows that it is designed more for political goals than to eliminate financial barriers to health care . For example , the actual coverage does n't even begin until 2013 , opportunistically after the next presidential election , in 2012 . Run on having accomplished `` historic reform '' but before anyone actually experiences how bad it is ? How cynical is that ? Yes , there are some good provisions . The best relate to improving existing programs like the Indian Health Service , community health centers , and health professionals education and training ; all are important for New Mexico . But there bad provisions , which comprise most of the 1,990 pages of the bill . Five key reasons this legislation must be stopped : & # 8226 ; If passed , this law will move the U.S. farther from universal health care , making it harder than ever to accomplish health care justice in the future . If Congress does not have the courage to stand up to the private insurance industry now , it will be even more difficult in the future , especially after giving the industry trillions of new dollars through this terrible legislation . Let 's call this what it is : another corporate bailout on the backs of working people . Pay attention to your federal representatives as they carefully talk about `` health insurance reform . '' They are n't talking about health reform any more . Congress could have defended and built up a system based on popular , high-quality government-run health programs like the military and veterans fully socialized health systems or Medicare , a single-payer program . Instead , the president and Congress let the corporations and government-haters take control of the agenda . & # 8226 ; The legislation institutionalizes permanent inequality in health care . Unlike Medicare where all beneficiaries have a single plan , this bill further divides the U.S. system into tiers based on ability to pay . It creates basic , enhanced , premium and premium-plus plans . A basic plan will provide only 70 percent of the coverage of a `` reference benefit package , '' one that includes even fewer services than most insured people have today . The bill does n't even mention coverage for essential services like vision and adult dental care except in the most costly premium-plus plan . & # 8226 ; Out-of-pocket costs remain sky high . Everyone will be required to pay monthly insurance premiums . Some low-wage workers will receive taxpayer subsidies on a sliding scale . The lowest income people will have full subsidies . But remember , this is not money for care , it is support only to buy insurance . Almost everyone will have to meet a deductible , capped in the bill at $ 1,500 a year , higher than most insurance-plan deductibles today . On top of this , insurance companies can charge even more under various `` cost sharing '' schemes for items like co-pays and co-insurance . The bill puts a cap on cost sharing , but the total amount is obscene . The cap for an individual is $ 5,000 a year and for a family it is $ 10,000 before the plan must cover everything . Well , not exactly everything . Even after paying this huge amount of money , the legislation still allows the corporations to make us pay , billing for non-network providers and , since it is not a comprehensive benefit package , we are still on our own to pay for health care that the plans refuse to cover . The legislation creates a law to let these corporations increase what they charge people as they get older . In fact , they can be charged up to twice as much as younger people for identical coverage . & # 8226 ; The legislation makes it illegal to not buy health insurance . The penalties are described in a section of the legislation called `` Shared Responsibility . '' This will let the IRS impose a tax of up to 2.5 percent of modified adjusted gross income for not having health insurance . People on the financial edge , people fighting foreclosure to stay in their homes or people who are unemployed all or part of a year will not be able to afford the insurance premiums or the penalties for not having insurance . & # 8226 ; We will all be drowning in paperwork , which will continue to drive up administrative costs . Right now , insurance administrative waste is about 30 percent of every health care dollar- or about $ 1 billion a day . Adding more people to an insurance-based system will result in even more money going into this bottomless pit . As if this is n't bad enough , the government will be setting up many new agencies to oversee the whole process including , at the top , the Orwellian Health Choices Administration , headed by the Health Choices Commissioner . This is not an agency to help us make health care choices , but to choose a health insurance company . The IRS will play a very large role in everything from certifying our income for subsidies to monitoring and taxing people who do n't buy insurance . Health Insurance Exchanges will be created across the country with at least one in every state offering both Web sites and telephone assistance . This is where we will go every year to pick our insurance plan in an open enrollment period of at least 30 days between September and November . We can add this unpleasant task to all of our other fall chores . It is hard to imagine the chaos and wasted resources with the entire country picking insurance plans at the same time , attended by marketing , billboards , advertising and misinformation . We will gamble as we choose a plan , decide which corporation will be the best for us , hoping we pick one that is not dominated by corporate bureaucrats focused on rationing care to maximize their profits . It is not an easy task and if a wrong plan is selected , we are stuck for a year , until the next national open enrollment cycle . The United States can do better . We can build on a strengthened and well-funded Medicare program . In Medicare , when a person reached the age of eligibility or is determined to qualify because they have a permanent disability , they are in , and there is no re-enrollment . Imagine real reform , as simple as adding people ages 55 to 65 years old to Medicare in 2010 , 35-55 in 2011 , and so on until everyone is included by 2013 . The bills that promote this kind of reform are under 200 pages , they are simple to implement , cost effective and equitable . Choose a doctor , choose a hospital when needed and let the government pay the bills . Everyone in one system . That is what real health reform would look like . © 2009 The Alburquerque Journal Miller is a long-time public health professional and health care advocate . She lives in Ojo Sarco .

That does not how ever prove evolution .
POLICE are hunting armed bandits who have stolen more than $ 30,000 worth of guns in targeted home invasions Police fear the guns could be sold on the black market or used to commit further violent crimes . The chilling ambush attacks on family homes in Trafalgar , on August 19 , and Hampton Park , in June , are almost identical , with a crew of five masked men storming both houses in search for guns . In the Hampton Park attack , a woman and her three teenage children were tied up as their father was made to open a safe containing $ 25,000 worth of high-powered pistols . At the Trafalgar home , a woman , eight months pregnant , was pushed to the ground and bound as her husband was forced to retrieve $ 10,000 worth of guns from a safe and hand them over .
Many believe that the amount of factors that would have needed to be just right for humans to evolve , make the chances of it happening dismissible . But one needs a better understanding of odds before making this argument . Let me give an example . Say that the chances of a coin landing and balancing on the edge are 3 billion to one . I then run a test were I make 3 billion people flip one coin each . Now lets say that the most likely out come occurred  one persons coin landed on the edge . If he could not see the rest of the experiment that person would assume that he is special . But in the grand scheme of things it is nothing special at least one person was likely to get a coin to land on its edge . It is the same with Earth ; it is nothing special in the big picture considering the incomprehensible amount if possible solar systems .

Sorry , but what you do not realize is that we kicked out European forms of government in 1776 . We saved European governments in WW2 . The USA was the very FRIST government ever to be rulled by common and free men . When the USA first had the vote , Europe still had kings and emperors .

They grow up watching the people around them committing crimes , and such behavior becomes normalized . A kid that grows up with guns in the house that are used for hunting and self defense will learn that 's what guns are for . A kid that grows up being exposed to guns being used to rob and kill will learn a very different lesson about what guns are for . The former will be disarmed by gun control laws because they have no plans to commit crimes and learn that laws are to be obeyed . The latter will not be affected at all by more gun control laws , because they already have easy access to guns through illegal channels and have no inclination to obey laws . If they did , they would n't be committing crimes in the first place . The only way to stop the cycle of violence is to address the causes and stop the socialization . Morality , values , and discipline need to be instilled in the youth of America . The only way that can happen is by strengthening families and increasing the positive influences on their lives . All too often these troubled kids are left without adequate adult supervision , either due to imprisonment or overburdened work schedules . Absent parents , even if well equipped themselves , often can not convey these concepts onto their children , so they grow up without them and learn their mores on the streets . Exacerbating the problem is the culture of the welfare state , where children grow up with welfare as a way of life and are accustomed to getting something for nothing . This often fosters a sense of entitlement . They 've really never seen someone earn what they have through legitimate enterprises , so learn to idolize the criminal element who seemingly gain high status and material goods through illegal activities . There are no easy solutions . Education must be reformed , family values rebuilt , the institute of marriage returned to a revered status , teachers better trained and empowered to teach not indoctrinate , and a government that understands it is there to serve , not rule . Gun control can not and does not address any of these issues . Anyone who believes otherwise is deluding themselves into seeking a futile path towards stopping the violence . A gun can be an instrument to commit a crime , or it can be an instrument to stop a crime . It is the person behind it who chooses , and it is the person behind it who needs the change , not the law .

Bryan , Off the top of your head , can you think of any other misdemeanors that result in the suspension/removal of a persons rights for the rest of their lives ?

The death toll from fierce street battles in downtown West Kingston has risen to 44 and is expected to climb further as Jamaican security forces continue efforts to flush out the alleged drugs baron Christopher `` Dudus '' Coke . The latest figures were released after a team led by the public defender Earl Witter and including the Jamaican Red Cross visited the Tivoli Gardens district , scene of the worst fighting . Witter told local media : `` The police , I gather , have put out a figure of some 26 dead so far . Our own headcount supersedes that . In fact we visited the morgue and were told that no fewer than 35 bodies were lodged there , and most of them were males , mainly young adults . '' While at the morgue his team was told of another nine bodies being collected , he said . At least 37 people are reported to have been injured and the government has appealed for blood donations . In addition 211 people including six women have been detained . The team was sent in by the Jamaican prime minister , Bruce Golding , following claims of abuse by police and soldiers who stormed the Tivoli Gardens ghetto on Monday in search of Coke , 42 , wanted on drug and gun-running charges in the US . He is still at large , with unconfirmed reports saying he slipped out of Tivoli Gardens on Monday while Jamaican soldiers were engaged in an intense firefight . Civilians have been the main victims during three days of street battles between security forces and gunmen loyal to Coke , the alleged leader of the notorious Shower Posse gang , who have erected barricades of barbed wire and junked cars . Soldiers have told local media of five-hour gun battles in the streets . A state of emergency has been declared in the West Kingston area , said to be Coke 's stronghold and where he is regarded as a benefactor by many people . The intensity of the fighting in the heart of the West Kingston slums , which is Golding 's own constituency , has taken the government by surprise , the prime minister has admitted . More than 2,000 soliders flooded into the neighbourhood after Jamaica agreed to extradite Coke to the US . Residents in the no-go area have complained of grenades being thrown by soldiers and of bodies being burned in the streets . Witter said they had seen no evidence of bodies being burned . Golding told MPs : `` The government deeply regrets the loss of lives , especially those of members of the security services and innocent , law-abiding citizens caught in the crossfire . `` The security forces were directed to take all practical steps to avoid casualties as much as possible . '' The `` most thorough investigations '' would be undertaken to examine all deaths caused by troops or police , he said . The country 's security forces have a reputation for slipshod investigations and being too quick on the trigger . Security agents would go after `` criminal gunmen in whatever community they may be ensconced '' , he said . Government officials told reporters all the dead civilians in West Kingston were men , but people inside the slums who called local radio stations claimed there had been indiscriminate shooting during the all-out assault by police and soldiers . Gunmen fighting for Coke describe him as a `` godfather '' figure who helps provide services and protection to the poor West Kingston community . The services and protection are allegedly funded by a criminal empire that seemed untouchable until the US demanded his extradition . Coke , also known as the President , has built a loyal following and turned the neighbourhood into his stronghold . One placard seen at a barricade read : `` Jesus died for us . We will die for Dudus . '' US authorities claim he has amassed a vast arsenal in his Kingston home turf and has been trafficking cocaine to the streets of New York since the mid-90s , allegedly hiring island women to hide the drugs on themselves on flights to the US . The UK Foreign Office is advising British nationals to avoid the areas of West Kingston  Tivoli and Denham Town in particular  and Mountain View because of `` substantial unrest including gunfire '' . `` There remains an increased risk of further outbreaks of civil disorder and street violence in Kingston and possibly in other urban centres in Jamaica , '' says the Foreign Office advice . The Shower Posse , referred to by the FBI as `` the most violent and notorious criminal organisation ever in America '' , is believed responsible for more than 1,000 deaths in the US and Jamaica during the cocaine wars of the 1980s . Earning its name from its `` showering '' of bullets at rivals during gun battles , it operates mainly in Jamaica , the US and Canada . A splinter group called the President Click is known to have operated in the UK  in parts of Brixton in south London known as Little Tivoli . Former Shower Posse leaders include Coke 's father , Lester Coke , who died in a mysterious fire in his prison cell in 1992 while awaiting extradition to the US on drug and murder charges .

Chicago could limit handgun ownership , require registration - chicagotribune.com Now I know we did n't expect Daley to just roll over and take his losses like a real man . But to suggest that people be allowed to own only one single handgun is quite a step even for him . Even DC did n't try that one . I do n't see how such a proposal would ever pass a legal challenge . You 'd never get away with telling people they could only buy one book in their lifetime . And what exactly are you supposed to do if the gun you buy turns out to be something you do n't like for whatever reason ? Or what if it breaks and ca n't be repaired ?

Prominent conservative J. Harvie Wilkinson of the 4th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals compared Heller to Roe v. Wade and criticized it for its lack of adherence to conservative methodology : `` Heller represents a triumph for conservative lawyers . But it also represents a failure - the Court 's failure to adhere to a conservative judicial methodology in reaching its decision . In fact , Heller encourages Americans to do what conservative jurists warned for years they should not do : bypass the ballot and seek to press their political agenda in the courts . '' SSRN-Of Guns , Abortions , and the Unraveling Rule of Law by J. Wilkinson Supreme Court Justice Stevens also made a similar criticism . `` With emphasis on the word 'genuine , ' Stevens said that 'a genuine judicial conservative ' would not have inserted the Court into the 'political thicket ' of the gun rights debate as Scalia had done . '' The BLT : The Blog of Legal Times : Supreme Court : Scalia and Stevens Duke It Out So are pro-gun activists not so different than gay rights activists ?

I will let the people decide through their elected representatives how much gun control is necessary in their own communities . ''

Religion= faith in a deity or deities ( rough definition ) Atheism= lack of religion/deities Therefore , atheism= lack of faith There is no `` faithful '' beginning point of atheism .
First off the single common ancestor model has no demonstratable mechanism for how it is even possible . For another thing no substantive reasoning that all scientists use is empirically testable which is why subjective/objective duality is the philosophy of natural science . There is only a need to discern between the substantive reasoning ( theoretical ) and empirical testing ( demonstrative ) . Objectivism is based on substantive reasoning just like scientific positivism or natural selection for that matter . None of these things are subject to peer review since there is a distinction between subjective and objective reasoning .
Why , is there something wrong with being pro abortion ?
The bible also says that I should be killed for my haircut . The bible said that I should be able to own Mexicans as slaves . The bible says that we should kill all women if they have sex before they marry . Should we make these laws too ? The bible has nothing to do with laws . If you do n't like gay marrige , do n't marry someone your own sex . Simple as that .
You ca n't bear to hear this , but Genesis is not infallible . It 's a fact that it was written by 2 different groups of people and combined in Egypt in 90 AD . The book was not written as you read it today . It was passed down orally over hundreds of years before anyone ever bothered to write it down . Therefore , it 's about 1/100th as important to me and my faith as the Gospels , which were written down by eye-witnesses at the spoken time . So yes , I believe that God created the world , but I believe his tool was evolution .

I think you are misinterpreting what I am saying . For example , we would still exist without a lung or a heart if that lung or heart were replaced by artificial lungs or hearts . Indeed , if you push things to the extreme case ( and , granted , this is going into the science fiction realm but it proves a point ) , if we could artificially keep our functioning brains alive and functioning on their own ( without a body ) , then `` we '' would still exist as long as the brain 's function involved all the mental processes related to our mental existence . That existence would just be pretty dismal without any sensory inputs or freedom of motion ( unless they were supplied artificially ) . That is what I am heading at . What are we at our very core ?

The title suggests that either pathway is possible . Yet no evidence has been presented to suggest that either pathway is possible .

`` In his encyclical Humani Generis , my predecessor Pius XII has already affirmed that there is no conflict between evolution and the doctrine of the faith regarding man and his vocation Today , more than a half-century after the appearance of that encyclical , some new findings lead us toward the recognition of evolution as more than an hypothesis . In fact it is remarkable that this theory has had progressively greater influence on the spirit of researchers , following a series of discoveries in different scholarly disciplines The convergence in the results of these independent studieswhich was neither planned nor soughtconstitutes in itself a significant argument in favor of the theory .

As usual , the Brady campaign is lying . The senate voted by a narrow margin to attach the riders to the manufaturers liability bill . Then the senate voted and the bill as a whole was defeated 90-8 . Even if it HAD passed the senate ( which we knew it would n't ) it was expected to be killed in the house . Here is an article on it : http : //www.news-miner.com/Stories/0 , ... 993580,00.html The decisive moment seemed to be during the later arguments on the bill . While they were debating whether or not to ammend the bill to include the assault weapons ban , Feinstein ( d-california ) claimed that the assault weapons ban legislation `` has reduced the proportion of banned assault weapons traced to crime by two-thirds . '' During final arguments before the completed bill was voted on , Craig ( R-Idaho ) and Young ( R-Alaska ) got up there and completely shredded her numbers . IT was made very clear by the end that she was a liar . God , I love Cspan ! Of course , the Brady campaign has labeled this a `` victory '' . They can have all the victories like that ( where nothing at all happens ) that they can handle . Teh house is still expected to pass the gun makers protection bill WITHOUT the riders . Senate leadership suggests that it can be fully expected to pass in the senate `` the democrats simply do n't have enough votes to stop it '' .
Yes we agree on the last point but that is done by the people who choose to carry that makes criminals think twice about attacking you ... He does not know if you are armed or not .

Male How old are you ? 18-30 Are you religious ? no If yes , what type of religion are you ? _________________ do u favor abortion ? Yes . Do you believe that a fetus in a women 's body is just undeveloped tissue or a start in where human life begins ? Undeveloped tissue . Both . Human life . Do you believe that if a woman became pregnant because she was a product of incest , that she should have an abortion ? Maybe or depends . Do you believe that if a woman became pregnant because she was a product of rape , that she should have an abortion ? Maybe or depends . If a woman 's life is threatened by the pregnancy of the baby , should she have an abortion ? Maybe or depends . Do you believe that having an abortion will take one 's life away ? Maybe or depends . Do you believe that a woman should be able to choose if she wants an abortion or should it be the government 's choice ? Woman 's choice . Depends . Government 's choice . The end !

Absolutely nothing could persuade me to change my mind . It is absolutely abhorrent to me that a woman would be denied ownership and autonomy over her own body . It is a gross violation of human rights and liberty . Here I stand , for liberty and human rights . I shall not be moved .

Also another example put forward is a bacteria that can only sustain itself by eating Nylon . The theory goes - nylon is a recent invention therefore this bacteria must have eolved recently . What it suggests however is that a portion of an existing population would have died if not for nylon ... the bug has to have nylon , or it will die . It is akin to looking at a portion of the human population who would die from heart-trouble . But thankfully we 've now got artificial hearts , therefore this portion can survive . They are not a new species of human , but live only because of a recent invention .

I 've new to this site and everything and have spent a lot of time going through the abortion forum because I 'm about to have one and am curious as to what people are discussing . It seems that a lot of people have very strong opinions on abortion , but that 's about as far as it goes , opinions . Has anybody on this forum ever had any experience with abortions ? Ever had one yourself or know someone who had gone through it ? Just curious as to how many people have gone through this traumatic event because I know that for myself , even being pro-choice , my opinions and views have changed . For instance , I do n't for a second buy into the bs that is `` a fetus is not alive or a human being '' . I know for a fact that the baby growing inside me alive , I just can not accept it at this time in my life . Thanks for your responses .

You might very well be acurate here , but no one asked for a time frame on a gun ban , only if it could happen . And Obama could very well hire someone right out of the gate to write a gun ban for him to send through a biased congress for approval , and then sign it himself , sending it into law .

Genisis 19:30-36 And Lot went up out of Zoar , and dwelt in the mountain , and his two daughters with him ; for he feared to dwell in Zoar : and he dwelt in a cave , he and his two daughters . And the firstborn said unto the younger , Our father is old , and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth : Come , let us make our father drink wine , and we will lie with him , that we may preserve seed of our father . And they made their father drink wine that night : and the firstborn went in , and lay with her father ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she arose . And it came to pass on the morrow , that the firstborn said unto the younger , Behold , I lay yesternight with my father : let us make him drink wine this night also ; and go thou in , and lie with him , that we may preserve seed of our father . And they made their father drink wine that night also : and the younger arose , and lay with him ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she arose . Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father .

STUTTGART , Germany - A 17-year-old gunman dressed in black opened fire at his former high school in southwestern Germany on Wednesday , killing at least 15 people before police shot him dead , officials said . Nine students and three teachers were among the dead , State Interior Minister Heribert Rech said . It was Germany 's worst shooting since another teenage gunman killed 16 people and himself in another high school in 2002 . Most of the slain students were found dead in the school and the gunman killed an adult outside the building as he escaped , regional police spokesman Klaus Hinderer said . `` He went into the school with a weapon and carried out a bloodbath , '' said regional police chief Erwin Hetger . `` I 've never seen anything like this in my life . '' After the attack , the suspect fled the Albertville high school toward the center of Winnenden , a town of 28,000 , Hinderer said , before police tracked him down . The teenager graduated from the school last year , police said . Witnesses said students jumped from the windows of the school building after the gunman opened fire . Concerned parents quickly swarmed around the school , which was evacuated during the incident . The man entered the school at 9:30 a.m. and opened fire , shooting at random , police said . Police said the suspect was dressed in a black . About 1,000 children attend the school , located in a suburb some 12 miles northeast of Stuttgart . In 2002 , 19-year-old Robert Steinhaeuser shot and killed 12 teachers , a secretary , two students and a police officer before turning his gun on himself in the Gutenberg high school in Erfurt . Steinhaeuser , who had been expelled for forging a doctor 's note , was a gun club member licensed to own weapons . The attack led Germany to raise the age for owning recreational firearms from 18 to 21 .

Typical little child , all he can offer is condescending insults while never daring to refute the arguments made . But you 're in good company as that is all your cohorts can do also .

In fact , this along with mutations essentially destroys the belief of molecules to man evolution as they both have no possible way of acquiring the massive amounts of new genetic information required for evolution to be a valid explanation for our origins .
If its white and a baby . There are far more unwanted children , even if we exclude aborted feti , than there are potential adopters .
Not some as you say `` crackpot '' Creationist . These are only two of the many scientist that are embarrassed by the outrageous dishonesty of their contemporaries .

Although much younger than the dinosaur bones we had been collecting , these fossils were still thousands of years old , dating back to a time when the Sahara was much wetter than today .

This applies only when men strive ... that is fight . If a man `` Accidently '' hits a woman while in a fight and causes her to lose her child then all he has to do is pay a fine . But if he keeps fighting and hurt other people he gets killed . Even in the Bible you dont get punished so severly on accidents .
I can understand your point that , in the absolute , metaphysical sense , we can never be 100.00 % sure of any of our knowledge . Just because all humans always have experienced the existence of the world , does n't mean that it is 100.00 % certain , just that the probability that it is true approaches 100.00 % ( say , 99.9999999 % ) . The greater the amount of evidence , the closer that certainty is to 100.00 % . That 0.0000001 % leaves room for obsurd scenarios - such as that an omnicient being is causing us all to merely imagine our reality , or the scenario of the movie `` The Matrix '' . These can be fun to ponder ( especially in a social situation after a few drinks ) , but no one takes them seriously . If anyone did seriously live by the idea that the world may not exist , they would quickly do something stupid and die , or change their minds .
Your position , it seems to me , turns on issues of quality of life and social justice such that children are entitled to either a minimum quality of life or none at all , and that preserving a woman 's right to control over her body is necessary for her quality of life as an equal citizen .
The fetus has never achieved conciousness , let alone has known anything .
What are 'a levels ' ? Is that at university , or school ?
Of course they do , just as they also support abortion for the reason of gender selection .
The old school creationists seem to be taking a new tact of proclaiming evolution to be a religion rather than true science .
What an embarrassment .
Conversely , if the fetus and the mother are equal , the fetus does not have the right to suck nutrients from the mother against her will .
This is not evolution . It is not a mutation . This is adaptaion .

1 ) The context changes nothing . The comment is the same with or without more sentences surrounding it . 2 ) `` rejected giving marriage rights/benefits to unmarried straight couples '' ? ? ?

'' To try and compare a situation where one group has the CHOICE to use a right , and then chooses not to , to a second group that is DENIED that choice , is mind-bogglingly absurd .

Therefore I would propose fathering laws , to hold men responsible for abortions , by mandating that women who have abortions , can give the name of the man or boy , and that simple DNA testing can prove they are the father , and those hesitant fathers , should do three months of hard labor , for each abortion they cause , by their lack of commitment and affection . In this way , the girls , and women are not imprisoned , or punished , but men who choose not to use a condom , and made false promises , will pay for their part of the sin . Of course , the girl , must be willing to give the name , and if she is given anonymity , and protections , she can do so , or not , if she chooses to , or not to . After which , before the abortion , the Father could be contacted by some means and given notice , such that later , after the abortion he can not claim that he did not know , and as such , is guilty , if he allows the abortion to occur . THIS , will give the man , the chance to marry the girl , or be punished for his lack of affection and concern . But again , all of this is dependant on the girl , willingly giving the mans name , and he must actually be the father to be convicted . And as such , this law would directly prevent most abortions , by making the fathers responsible for them , as they SHOULD BE ! So , unless they actually want to have kids THIS LAW , will put a condom on all males . So , if the goal is to prevent abortions , the best and only real solution is to get the males to wear a condom , and or otherwise be willing support the child , or to MARRY THE GIRL ! ! ! ! This kind of law , would do just that ... and does not punish the female . -Mosheh Thezion

It has been observed . I list it as an assumption because nothing can be proven completely ( just a technicality ) .
Democracy is not binary , it 's a continuum . In fact , most countries that have claimed to be communist are those which have been subject to some form of violent revolution - those who get there democratically tend to find the US has paid a right wing armed group to launch a coup and do n't last long . The only times governments claiming to be communist have survived is when they 're too totalitarian for US agents to be able to undermine them .

If you mean starting from scratch with absolutely no genetic material at all as part of the formula or equation , then I do n't believe man will ever accomplish that . Only God can create new life from nothing , or from non life shall we say .
Science is knowledge , all knowledge , that is , anything we find to be true . There is no other `` truth '' out there , if there were , we 'd be omniscient .
Ironic , since your `` Out of China '' post was basically the same as this post . You even claim you had no debate point , you were just posting `` information '' . It was n't until you claimed that evolution relied on those two mutual theories that we proceeded to debate . Maybe this young 13 year old christian is just following in your golden footsteps ... you might give them a little leeway if you , yourself , do this as well . Or are you above the rules of the average forum participant ? Hmmm . -Mach

An alternative ( shorter ! ) wording of the statement , taking into account the greater context of the Constitution , would be `` A ( human ) zygote is a person '' . As hinted by the title , the general context of this thread is how the statement relates to the rights of a zygote ; we may end up branching out into that area , but the statement is the starting point .

But on the general relation of Mendelism to Evolution I have come to a very definite conclusion ... the essence of Mendelian characters is their rigidity .

Well , at some point they are sentient beings ( surely you agree ) , that 's the point that the fetus becomes a person in my opinion . Before that it 's not really too bad . I do n't have a problem with people `` having sex in an improper way '' or choosing to `` screw each other how they would like to screw each other '' . I do have a problem with people creating a feeling being and then killing it , as is the case when fetuses become sentient and are aborted . You also say that it is my opinion , which it is , but it is also your opinion . You have said that women who have abortion because they ar n't responsible are making bad decisions .
You make assumptions that arrogantly consign all religious people to irrational beings . It is rather irrational and sad to do so . Ah but for a little insight to see that you apply to science a place science does n't seek . Are you saying that given enough time you can come with answers ? That 's a statement of faith . This must be why you 're determined to raise science onto a pedestal , so you can believe that it 's answers are above us , giving us guidance from above - simply replacing the role of God/church with science . Why do you apply the term evolution to these ? Do you , deep-down , believe that these have resulted from evolution too ? You are not alone in making evolution an absolute all-encompassing world-view ... Oddly enough Close_slave_can denies that anyone does this .
whoa - not quite so fast . Since your statements ( previous to this one ) obviously do not represent what I either meant , nor said , then your next statement does not represent my position either . Correct . ( Spit-bubble : So , if I 'm in a similar position and trust in God , and end up with a damaged child , damage to my own health , my death or the death of my unborn fetus ... Does that mean God let me down and I should curse God for such an obviously disloyal act ? )

Another question might be , have evolutionists figured out the `` mock '' gene yet ? Mockery was a great ingredient in Christian salvation . Judas mocked Jesus in the garden , the chief priests and scribes laughed him to scorn , Herod mocked him , the servants and the soldiers jeered at him and insulted him , and on the cross all sorts of taunts were thrown at him
Can you be a bit more specific ?
Since when ?
Get rid of the reasons why people have abortions and then ban abortion .

What are the chances that a H. sapiens would be born with your mother 's genetic code ? How about your father 's ? So , knowing how slim the chances are of those two events , the idea that a H. sapiens would be someday born on the planet earth with your precise genetic code in the ( at a guess ) latter quarter of the 20th century are - how did you put it now ? - Practically impossible .
Ok , I will admit that I have not been reading your posts that do not involve me . I think you said something about not answering questions directed at others , right ? Are you now saying , `` read all of my posts , anyway '' ?
Is this the same Kent Hovind found guilty of tax evasion ? I dunno where Christians get their morals from , but it ca n't be the same place as professional Creationists .

Those who object to same-sex marriage primarily ( or so they claim ) because it would `` change the definition of marriage '' should perhaps be made aware that that train has already left the station : Merriam-Webster On-line http : //www.m-w.com/dictionary/marriage Dictionary.com http : //dictionary.reference.com/browse/marriage Encarta http : //encarta.msn.com/encnet/featur ... fid=1861628509 American Heritage http : //www.bartleby.com/61/2/M0120200.html This is not to say that every current dictionary includes such a definition ... yet ... but a number of major on-line ones demonstrably do , and to my knowledge human civilization has yet to suffer any negative effects . ( By the way , the above entries also include the typical `` husband and wife '' kind of arrangement as well . Funny how words can have more than one meaning , is n't it ? )

The US death rate due to medical misadventures is around 225,000 death annually made up of 12,000 deaths due to unnecessary surgery , 7,000 from medication mistakes in hospitals , 20,000 caused by other mistakes in hospitals , 80,000 fatalities from infections in hospitals and 106,000 due to the negative effect of drugs . So the most lethal inventions is not the gun or the car but in fact the doctor
Absolutely , and that 's because it 's wrongly perceived as a 'freedom thing ' . There 's no such thing as the 'freedom ' to be taught something of no scientific merit in a science class .
then there is little chance of consensus because other groups or religions come up with other arbitrary set of rules and we are back to the situation of , in the worst case , chaos and , in the best case , a majority imposing arbitrary rules on an unwilling suffering minority .

Yes , I believe that in most circumstances , the child should be carried to term , but there are exceptions to every rule , and I 'm not quite ready to forsake the lives and health of women to protect unborn children . Yes , I think the unborn child is worthy of protection , but not any more so than the mother , in fact probably less .
If you do not think it did happened it is your privilege , provided by your Maker . Yet because there are those who do not accept a record as factual it does not make it a `` myth '' . ( This is just plain logic . )

Bertvan : Ive never seen a nonliving process exhibit volition , and I see evidence that all living organisms , including plants and sponges show some limited ability to respond creatively to stimuli . More from the article by WascallyWabbit :
ToE says that there are two forces in evolution : random mutation , and natural selection .
If abortion is , once again , made illegal , then the states need to establish penalties . For non-medically needed partial birth abortions , I 'd throw the woman and doctor in jail without a second thought . NEXT ! !
And as such , the term as you use it is utterly meaningless as it could be applied to any cell or sell remnant of human origin .
Except for possible exception of a couple evangelistic atheists , the design argument is from the creationist side . It is pretty old being first stated by William Paley . Darwin respected Paley and thought his arguments beautiful until he actually started looking at reality ( Darwin also lived in that same rooms at Christ 's College , Cambridge that Paley did ) . The argument from design is presented as `` proof '' of God or an `` intelligent '' designer for those who want to pretend that intelligent design creationism ins't creationism . But the argument on the other side is that it is flawed design and therefore is n't `` proof '' . Evolutionary biologists do n't assert that there is not god , only that there is no evidence from nature that there is one . Science is naturalistic . Even if some scientists ( and others ) are philosophical naturalists , science does n't work that way . It is methodological naturalism simply because there are no tools by which science can examine or quantify the supernatural . It sounds silly when some claim that scientists are wrong when they fail to consider the supernatural in naturalism .
It would n't . Altering any of the fundamental universal constants changes them all . We would n't be considering some small change here and small change there . The universe probably would n't exist in any form .
In response to your defense of the obvious child , you give him too much credit for actually thinking through his reasons for posting this thread .
you see , the thing is that not everybody agrees with some of the theories that usually accompany evolution ( including Big Bang , abiogenesis , etc ) that try to answer the question `` how come existence '' .
My second disagreement with the paper is a computer would be useless to model living systems , because a computer can not model volition , the defining characteristic of life .
# 2 was questioning the personal , non-scientific beliefs of the evolution believer
I believe its Satans presence that causes atheism and it also causes false religions to be dreamed up .

Should we allow health-care to the homeless , and illegal ? For the homeless : Yes . However , I think that it should be based upon how they got to be homeless . Because , sometimes , it 's their fault . And in those times , I do n't think that we should have to cover all of their health-care . DO I believe that we should cover some of it ? Yes , because it 's the right thing to do , and it is what our nation claims . Equal rights . However , I have nothing to say on the issue of the illegal , because a member in my family was recently attacked ( stabbed ) by one , and the wounds are too fresh , and if I speak on it , I will be speaking with prejudice , so I will leave that subject alone . But , what are your views ?

It has been brought to my attention , that getting your tubes tied or burned is considered abortion . Why ? Well , because you are preventing a human life . I , of course , do n't agree . However , it has been made clear that it is preventing life by preventing the egg that might be fertilized from being fertilized . I think that it is not fair . Say , perhaps , that the egg would never get fertilized ? Then could I get my tubes tied ? But , you will never know if the egg will ever produce into something more , until you die . So , should I not do what I want , based on something that I will never know ? What do you think ?
I guess I need to rethink the word punish , but I think you know that I do not mean literal punishment . The term `` punish '' is being used as simply that , a term .

Well , the first popular technique of creationists is to try to find examples of bad radiometric dates and offer these up as proof that radiometric dating is totally unreliable . Henry Morris , in his 1974 book `` Scientific Creationism '' made the claim that K/Ar dates for lava from the 1801 Hulalalei volcano lava flow ranged from 160 million years to 3 billion years old . With results like these , radiometric dating must be totally useless - how could scientists possibly be so stupid as to believe that radiometric dating could be of any merit when a simple lava flow gives such a wide range of dates - right in their own research ? As usual with such claims , we 'll have to dig a little further to get at the truth . Morris cited a study by Funkhouser and Norton  `` Radiogenic Helium and Argon in Ultramafic Inclusions from Hawaii '' published in the Journal of Geophysics Research , vol . 73 , pgs . 4601 - 4607 . What Morris did n't bother to inform his readers was that the study concerned xenoliths - fragments of foreign rock broken off by the magmas intrusion through the crust . Since they are not completely melted by the magma , they are in fact much older than the lava flow ( with K/Ar dating , what you are really dating is how long it has been since the rock solidified from the molten state - at this point the daughter Argon can no longer escape from the rock ) . That particular study confirmed ( as geologists already suspected ) that xenoliths could not be properly dated with the K/Ar method . The Funkhouser and Norton study clearly stated that the `` ages '' determined by K/Ar dating had no geological meaning and also determined that the xenoliths contained excess argon trapped in `` air '' bubbles inside the rock . Of course there was no mention of these details by Morris or any of the internet postings I have seen that still list this `` problem '' - despite the fact that Dalrymple answered it over 10 years ago . In the same paper , Dalrymple goes on to describe in detail several other quotes taken out of context by Creationists. ( http : //www.gate.net/~rwms/AgeEarth.html )

`` Abortion is not murder . Murder is illegal . Since Abortion is legal , it can not be murder . '' This is the formal structure of the ridiculous and false arguments to suggest that abortion is not murder . `` It can not be murder , because abortion is legal . '' Amazingly , you citizen-slaves fall for this illogical and ridiculous rant . The argument is illogical because it pre-supposes that abortion not being murder is valid in the premise . It does not matter if you do it , or the law supposes the premise True . It is also illogical because the definition of murder used has an arbitrary operator ( `` illegal '' ) , and no legitimate definition can have such an arbitrary operator as a part . The idea that deliberately killing a womb-trapped child is not murder is insane , lie-based and ridiculous .
Well said Jito . I do n't understand why pro-lifers dismiss pregnancy as easy and/or suggest that it 's a wonderful snuggly thing that 's just the best thing in the world . Even if you want a baby , it 's unbelievably hard to go through and something your body never fully recovers from . If you do n't want a baby and are being forced to go through it , it 's unbearable . You ca n't force somebody to go through this life-threatening condition that is always physically harmful .

Does Dembski claim to have discoverted a 4th law of thermodynamics , or the 4th law of thermodynamics ? While it is true that there are already 4 laws of thermodynamics , there is no 4th law of thermodynamics .

Also , I believe that Stuart Kauffman - who is clearly not a creationist or ID creationist - has ( also ) claimed to have discovered the 4th law of thermodynamics .

In a perfect world everybody would have the same chance , but the world is n't and not everybody does . What you really are saying is that the safety nets in place are not sufficient , because they do exist . Millions of Americans do not have health insurance , but that does not mean they do not have access to medical care . Could the available resources cover more services , be easier to access and be provided with higher quality , yes without question . EMT 's do n't ask for proof of insurance before you get on the ambulance . They may take someone to a certain ER , but they get in . Many states have medical services for children and pregnant women . Seniors and disabled have Social Security and Medi-Care along with many other health and social services at the State and Federal level . None of which existed 100 years ago . Not bad considering the country is only 234 years old . Some countries have better health services , some better education opportunities , some overall quality of life , but none rank as high as we do having the freedom and population that we do . Life , Liberty and the pursuit of happiness . There is no statement with regards to the quality of that life , that we have freedom to do as we please or that happiness will be acquired . This statement means your life is protected from being taken unjustly ( but it happens ) we are protected from being unjustly detained ( but it happens and is different than freedom ) and that unjust are not restrictions are placed on us . The DOI is concerned with the unfair treatment of the people by government . Stating that the government should be and is obligated to the interests of the governed . We the governed forget that our government is supposed to be the collective voice of those being represented . Who and how is the standard of care to be determined ? Do we restrict the pursuit of happiness because certain activities are more likely to require use of resources ? Do we mandate preventative care to better manage limited resources ? Does this apply to all people or just citizens ? Here illegally or legally , but not a citizen ? The desire is noble , the reality imposing , the solution unknown but the the fight worthwhile . Those who choose to participate in the government that governs them , will many times feel frustrated and disappointed , but will always have the potential for their voice to be heard amid the deafening silence of the uncaring masses

Thus , the standard genetic code appears to be a point on an evolutionary trajectory from a random point ( code ) about half the way to the summit of the local peak . The fitness landscape of code evolution appears to be extremely rugged , containing numerous peaks with a broad distribution of heights , and the standard code is relatively unremarkable , being located on the slope of a moderate-height peak .

I personally opted for abortion over adoption for two main reasons . 1 . I had no intention to get pregnant . I faithfully took the pill , and by fiance always used a condom . Despite these precautions , we experienced that `` percentage failure '' of contraception . I found out I was pregnant several weeks in , and my fiance and I made our decision together .
You talked about a 'natural bias ' that would stop evolution in its tracks . You 're going to have to be more specific about what 'stopping evolution in its tracks ' means . Do you mean preventing inheritable variation ? Preventing natural selection ? Preventing gene flow ? What ?
And you do n't have clam 's clue what my theory is , anyway .
Perhaps we just see it differently . If a woman does not share the view of the pro-lifer then you say being forced to could kill her . The difference is the pro-lifer sees it as two people , the unborn and the woman . So basically you ask if their is a chance of killing one should we be allowed to kill another . I 'd say no .
I agree and dinosaurs did not give birth to baby birds except in textbooks . Punctuated equilibrium anyone ?
Women have been denigrated and made fun of for centuries . I 've just gotten tired of it -- and righteously so .
This , of course , blows away Hi_Its_Me 's attempts to make evolution atheistic .
South Dakotans say `` repeal the extreme abortion ban ! '' Thanks to the hard work of 1,200 volunteers in 138 different cities and towns -- in nine weeks time -- we filed petitions with the names of more than 38,000 South Dakotans who are calling for the repeal of the extreme abortion legislation enacted by the South Dakota legislature and signed into law by Governor Mike Rounds on March 6. http : //www.sdhealthyfamilies.org/
I do n't think linking Darwinism and societal atrocities are an unprovoked first assertion . It 's a response to atheists/evolutionists who constantly link religion with societal atrocities .
Notice he is from a baptist church . The most bigest < term that has been banned > are baptists or catholic .
The ONLY reason is natural selection . Evolution is not needed .
I doubt whether an aortion clinis would give up the fetus for burial !
And just specifically what parts are those ? Mr. Bennett seems to think he is above the law , Canadian or otherwise . I quote from Page 3 of my US Passport
It is not the case of `` only in a america '' , montalban was australian and he was a poster here . A prominent australian creation supporter is Ken Ham although I doubt he posts here . But they are certainly stubborn . I have failed to have a discussion with any creationist despite repeated attempts .
Nature does n't allow homosexual sex to create life , to reproduce , and though humans use sex as entertainment , it obviously was meant for a greater purpose . Biology shows us we need both male and female to create life , that male and male does n't create life , that indivdual gratification does n't create life . If you want to attach relgious or philosophical significance to sex you may at this juncture . That is why I think it is wrong . Humanity would n't be around if homosexuality were the standard , homosexuals would n't exist without heterosexuals . You may be looking for a more fundamental `` morality '' to my basis . I choose to validate my beliefs on science and years of living proof of heterosexualitie 's superiority , and when I mean hetero superiority I mean strict hetero adhearance , no socially unacceptable behavior being thrown in like `` cheating '' or `` rape '' .
Bones are converted to rock by water slowly replacing the living tissue with minerals . It takes a long , long , long time . Not to mention carbon dating does work for most human remains ( effective for 70,000 years or younger ) , but not dinosaurs .
Well , I do n't think that is a good way to look at people .
You are right unless some people find their backbones , and since it doesnt look like thats going to happen I guess the rest of us better grow an extra one .
`` The Delaware Department of Justice initially insisted to The News that gun purchasers must declare who the weapon was intended for so that person 's background could be checked . Yesterday , a spokeswoman for the Delaware Department of Justice said it misinterpreted the law and that Brady was not obligated to state that the gun was for her son as long as he was legally qualified to own a firearm .
Okay . Most botanist are evolutionist but facts are often confusing to evolutionist . You do n't seem to grasp the concept of the hostile witness . Of course he is an evolutionist , they both are , if Ken Ham said that it would not mean much . What they are both saying is that the people who promote the dinosaurs to birds scenario are lying propagandist , not scientist . Just so you ca n't say I took it out of context here is Dr. Olsen 's letter in it 's entirety . National Museum of Natural History Smithsonian Institution Washington , D. C. 20560 1 November 1999 OPEN LETTER TO : Dr. Peter Raven , Secretary PRaven @ nas.org Committee for Research and Exploration National Geographic Society Washington , DC 20036 Dear Peter , I thought that I should address to you the concerns expressed below because your committee is at least partly involved and because you are certainly now the most prominent scientist at the National Geographic Society . With the publication of `` Feathers for T . rex ? '' by Christopher P. Sloan in its November issue , National Geographic has reached an all-time low for engaging in sensationalistic , unsubstantiated , tabloid journalism . But at the same time the magazine may now claim to have taken its place in formal taxonomic literature . Although it is possible that Mr. Czerkas `` will later name '' the specimen identified on page 100 as Archaeoraptor liaoningensis , there is no longer any need for him to do so . Because this Latinized binomial has apparently not been published previously and has now appeared with a full-spread photograph of the specimen `` accompanied by a description or definition that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon , '' the name Archaeoraptor liaoningensis Sloan is now available for purposes of zoological nomenclature as of its appearance in National Geographic ( International Code of Zoological Nomenclature , Article 13a , i ) . This is the worst nightmare of many zoologists -- -that their chance to name a new organism will be inadvertently scooped by some witless journalist . Clearly , National Geographic is not receiving competent consultation in certain scientific matters . Sloan 's article explicitly states that the specimen in question is known to have been illegally exported and that `` the Czerkases now plan to return it to China . '' In Washington , in June of 1996 , more than forty participants at the 4th International Meeting of the Society of Avian Paleontology and Evolution , held at the Smithsonian Institution , were signatories to a letter to the Director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences that deplored the illegal trade in fossils from China and encouraged the Chinese government to take further action to curb this exploitation . There were a few fossil dealers at that meeting and they certainly got the message . Thus , at least since mid-1996 it can hardly have been a secret to anyone in the scientific community or the commercial fossil business that fossils from Liaoning offered for sale outside of China are contraband . Most , if not all , major natural history museums in the United States have policies in effect that prohibit their staff from accepting any specimens that were not legally collected and exported from the country of origin . The National Geographic Society has not only supported research on such material , but has sensationalized , and is now exhibiting , an admittedly illicit specimen that would have been morally , administratively , and perhaps legally , off-limits to researchers in reputable scientific institutions . Prior to the publication of the article `` Dinosaurs Take Wing '' in the July 1998 National Geographic , Lou Mazzatenta , the photographer for Sloan 's article , invited me to the National Geographic Society to review his photographs of Chinese fossils and to comment on the slant being given to the story . At that time , I tried to interject the fact that strongly supported alternative viewpoints existed to what National Geographic intended to present , but it eventually became clear to me that National Geographic was not interested in anything other than the prevailing dogma that birds evolved from dinosaurs . Sloan 's article takes the prejudice to an entirely new level and consists in large part of unverifiable or undocumented information that `` makes '' the news rather than reporting it . His bald statement that `` we can now say that birds are theropods just as confidently as we say that humans are mammals '' is not even suggested as reflecting the views of a particular scientist or group of scientists , so that it figures as little more than editorial propagandizing . This melodramatic assertion had already been disproven by recent studies of embryology and comparative morphology , which , of course , are never mentioned . More importantly , however , none of the structures illustrated in Sloan 's article that are claimed to be feathers have actually been proven to be feathers . Saying that they are is little more than wishful thinking that has been presented as fact . The statement on page 103 that `` hollow , hairlike structures characterize protofeathers '' is nonsense considering that protofeathers exist only as a theoretical construct , so that the internal structure of one is even more hypothetical . The hype about feathered dinosaurs in the exhibit currently on display at the National Geographic Society is even worse , and makes the spurious claim that there is strong evidence that a wide variety of carnivorous dinosaurs had feathers . A model of the undisputed dinosaur Deinonychus and illustrations of baby tyrannosaurs are shown clad in feathers , all of which is simply imaginary and has no place outside of science fiction . The idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at Nature and National Geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith . Truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program , which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age -- -the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion . If Sloan 's article is not the crescendo of this fantasia , it is difficult to imagine to what heights it can next be taken . But it is certain that when the folly has run its course and has been fully exposed , National Geographic will unfortunately play a prominent but unenviable role in the book that summarizes the whole sorry episode . Sincerely , Storrs L. Olson Curator of Birds National Museum of Natural History Smithsonian Institution Washington , DC 20560 Ph . 202-357-33212 FAX 1-202-633-8084 email : olson.storrs @ nmnh.si.edu Why do n't you write Dr. Olsen and ask him if this is true ? This is not a case of disagreement on the interpretation of evidence , it is science versus science fiction . It is a direct accusation by the CURATOR OF BIRDS for the SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION against all the proponents of the dino bird story . Not some as you say `` crackpot '' Creationist . These are only two of the many scientist that are embarrassed by the outrageous dishonesty of their contemporaries . .
http : //www.talkingsquid.net/archives/133 Is an new scientific finding which shows that mammals evolved very early . Namely a very early lagomorph in the Cambrian . Excerpt : Those nasty deceptive Darwinians have been overthrown at last .
It is an atheist theory that tries to explain how life , the earth , the universe or whatever came to be while ignoring the idea that a deity simply created them .
No they are'nt . DNA of gametes is haploid , where as the stomatic cells of the mother and father are diploid . Also , egg and sperm DNA is jumbled , meaning it genes are swapped along chromsosomes , resulting in very different combinations then exist in the original stomatic cells . No , you 're wrong , the DNA of the egg and father have many of the same genes as the mother and father , but lack 1/2 of the same genes as well as the same placement .
All attempts to find a mechanism for evolution in microbiology are futile .
What astounds me is that those who favor abortion went through an identical development stage as the being they are condemning to death .
Maybe you could mention some of these plenty people .
If you think we ca n't rise up against tyranny , then you must support dictatorship .
`` If students ... do not understand the weaknesses of evolutionary theory as well as the strengths , a grave injustice is being done to them , '' Abrams said .
The old saying that knowledge is not borne out in the heart of fools is all too true . If you had the character that agreed rather with this statement : the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom , then I would think that we could make progress in this little exchange . I suspect though that you are bent on somehow informing me and others that the Bible is not valid and further , that God is not to be believed in .
If you do n't mind , could you just outline your paradigm please ?
11 ) Show me one instance of natural selection proven by controlled experiment . Heck , show me one controlled experiment attempting to test natural selection .

Why conception ? When a mature ovum leaves the ovary , it has every potential of turning into a human being . How dare I stand idly by while that potential life is wasted , unfertilized ? No ; clearly , it is my duty to try to reach that ovum with my seed . God said to be fruitful and multiply , so I am just following God 's will . They also went through the `` stage '' of being an unfertilized ovum . What about all the ova that were n't fertilized ? ! Just wasted , completely wasted and forgotten ! THE HUMANITY ! OH GOD ! ! ! Or , spend three months pregnant and then get an abortion , then you lose only one `` potential '' human instead of four . ( WHY MENSTRUAL CYCLES , GOD , WHY ? ! ) NOTE : To clear up any misconception , I am not promoting , condoning , or admitting to the act of rape . This is simply parody of what happens when we use unrealistic standards . I 'm sure that Joe does n't promote the rape of women to prevent the passing of unfertilized ova , but I think that his lack of doing so is inconsistent with his position expounded upon above . Bull hockey . Precautions occasionally fail . You can make an argument against the `` irresponsible '' pregnancies , but you ca n't lump every abortion into the group . Even Archie ran away when I nailed him on this one . Only in this country ? You ( purposely , no doubt ) overlooked the issue of whether they are `` people . '' Hell , by menstruating , women murder every month according to your logic .
Why do you think the dude in the article said how `` depressing '' all this is ?
I have been on the local board of education for 2 years now and have never heard the phrase `` Young Earth Creationists '' in any official capacity , nor has anybody ever suggested that it be taught .
I disagree I hear it all the time . What are you going to do when science fills in the gaps and such nonsense .
No worries mate . Brooklyn 's 81st Precinct probed by NYPD for fudging stats ; felonies allegedly marked as misdemeanors New York cops 'fudge ' stats like the Tories to make their `` strict gun laws '' look more compatible to the States that do not have draconian anti gun laws and need not depend on the cops protecting you when they have no duty to do so . I have been following UK stats for a long time and no matter who is in power , the crime rates increase . Often the perp is set free and the victem is the one punished like the incident you mentioned : Pushing someone out the way while attempting to escape is a violent crime under UK law .
So much for 'genetic altruism '
Hypocrisy at its highest . The Civil War was fought to establish the principle that each person owns his own body - a principle that the pro-life crowd is trying to destroy .
There is a huge difference in the things he described above , and what science does to determine what happened billions of years ago , what chance , evolutionary principles affect human behavior - countless other philosophical things that science involves itself in .
Essentially , as I understand things , one of the main components of evolutionary thought is that changes to new species take place gradually over long periods of time .
I 'm comparing the unknown organism that accidently sprung up out of the primordial swamp . Compared to God it certainly could not have been pretty .
My point was that just because an animal has features that resemble different animals does n't mean it has evolved from them .
Firstly , complete this sentence : If decreasing demand for meat in the western world decreases the price of meat in the developing world , increasing demand for vegetables in the western world _________ the price of vegetables in the developing world . Malnourished children are n't worried about getting meat . They ca n't even afford vegetables . Lower meat prices wo n't help them . In your own words `` most starving people today can not even afford grains ''
How is it that gay marriage recognition is an example of `` equality '' rather than a special right ? You already have the very same right to marry and opposite-sex person right now , as anyone else in this country . The problem is that you want a right over and above that -- special rights .
A relatively new argument for abortion is that life begins at conception and that any deliberate interruption of the process is murder . Most fundamentalists repeat what they have been told , not what the bible says about abortion .
The following is from an article , What Drives Evolution from LliveScience , and quoting Pigluicci . Perhaps someone who has been here long enough to acquire such privilege can post the link for me . Wascally Wabbit ?
To announce that there must be no criticism of the president , or that we are to stand by the president , right or wrong , is not only unpatriotic and servile , but is morally treasonable to the American public.  Theodore Roosevelt
Surely this question be easy enough to answer . Any rational thinking thiest want to give my question a shot ?
personally , i laugh when i 'm angry .
I believe there is special dispensation for those who 've never had a chance to hear the Good News . The last Pope mentioned something dealing with this a few years ago IIRC . This is also why the great commision for Christians is Evangelism .
What a crock . I find myself loving when you go on and on so that I can continue to wail on you with the Truth Stick of No Mercy . It 's usually you who is responsible for shutting yourself up . No , you 're branded as a religious zealot when you make arguments that people who do n't share your exact beliefs should have their rights taken away . Liberals were responsible for things like abolition of slavery and women 's suffrage that overturned the oh-so-traditional status quo . Now we 're working toward death with dignity for the terminally ill , reasonable gun control , access to abortion and contraception ( without sparking the ire of fundy parents and community members ) ... are these things that are despised by the rest of the world ? No , but things like slavery , sexism , rampant crime , and politicization of private issues are . The main cause of so much hate and disrespect is the phony war we 're fighting and our tactics in violation of international law , our attitude of superiority in the world , and our outright bullying of others , all of which are being pushed the most by -- you guessed it -- not liberals . No , Archie , you and your boys can take the blame for that one . Archie 's projection complex strikes again ! Pretty much , we can take whatever Archie says and know that the truth is the precise opposite .
Why must the anti-abortion crowd use such fallacious images to sell their point ?
Evolutionists have been searching for any direct evidence of the theory of evolution since the 1800 's . They are still looking . [ /QUOTE
Your take on this entire thing is ridiculous and unamerican . There is no evidence whatsoever that anything improper took place here . What happened is that a bunch of protesters who were careful not to break the law went and told a guy that he is a huge XXXXX . The DC PD sent 2 units to ensure that nobody was hurt during the course of the protest . The local police also sent units in response to calls from neighbors . The local police stayed until the end , but no arrests were made because , as they noted in their statement , the protesters were careful not to break any laws .
To cut through the debate about how exactly the different camps should be defined , I believe that a person becomes such at conception and should be considered as such when debatin their rights or lack thereof . More simply put ; I am pro life .
If the cost of initiating gay marriage is > $ 50Million , then it is an unfunded mandate by definition and as the CBO calculated , the costs will far exceed $ 50Million .
We are adapted to living longer .
trebor : Bertvan : You may call RM & amp ; NS a strawman , but that is what most Darwinists defend . Furthermore , no one has come up with a detailed materialistic alternative to random mutation and natural selection . All rely upon some version of accidental , meaningless change .
NOTE : When I say beneficial mutations , I am not talking about a gain of new genetic information to the genome . The organism can survive in the environment by a loss of genetic information i.e . the loss of a function , for example the loss of wings of a beatle on a windy island helps it to survive . If they had wings , they may be blown into the ocean and drown . Over time , you may get a population of wingless beatles - the adaption would be mutation by natural selection . Not evolution . Which also fits beautifully with the creation account .
Here 's a quote from mayr regarding selection , `` Only relatively few individuals in a given generation would qaulify and survive the selection procedure . That small sample would be able to preserve only a small amount of the whole variance of the parental population . Such survival selection would be highly restrained . '' What Evolution Is . pg . 118 So ... .do you evolutionists agree with this ? Let 's take humans . Are only a few people in this generation `` fit '' enough to go on to breed ? Is Mayr smoking crack or what ? ? ? ? ? ? This theory is pathetic .
Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox today threw his support behind the National Rifle Association 's challenge of a City of Chicago ordinance banning possession of most handguns by filing a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court . Cox 's amicus brief -- a document filed in court by someone not directly related to a case -- supports the request by the NRA to the Supreme Court for an appeal of the U.S . Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ' decision in June favoring the City of Chicago . At least 33 other states support the NRA 's request for the court to hear an appeal in National Rifle Association v. City of Chicago .
If you truly believe this , you are not a relativist , but a moral skepticist . This is a far more reasonable position to take .
Hmm - the stats say Western Europe has the lowest incidence of abortion . http : //www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_IAW.html
So the US Supreme court recognizes that some restrictions are reasonable such as not allowing felons to own guns or prohibiting people from carrying guns in school areas .
The fact that there are many in the scientific community who are now looking at regulatory genes should tell you something
What I 'd prefer is that the candidates be honest about their views , whether it 's popular or unpopular . But even knowing we 're talking about political candidates ( who may lie to get votes ) , when a candidate says something is his or her view , I think we have to take them at what they say when they answer a question like that so directly and emphatically . Otherwise , there 's little point in asking questions to begin with other than maybe watching the reaction of body language and how they would respond under pressure , and so forth . Political discourse has to operate to where when a candidate gives a given view as HIS or HER view , they are taken at their word that IS their view . `` No '' ca n't mean `` yes '' and so forth .
Despite all your hoplophobia , governments have killed more people , their own people in the last century than all wars combined . That is an indisputable fact .
Life did not start out simple and evolve into more complex and diverse animals ; it was complex and diverse right at the beginning .
No they could n't .
In order to study intelligence , it is essential to know and understand motivation , and motivation can not be known or understood without first knowing and understanding the value system of the entity under study .
Relavitism to me is a joke , because what it implies is that there are multiple truths . ... That 's how I see it .
Democracy determines what is morally acceptable in this country . WE have prositution legalized in Nevada but other states do not accept it . That is democracy . The people decide what is `` right '' and `` wrong '' based upon teh criteria that is conforming to the constituion .
Also , to all the woman who have had abortions , do you regret it ? Think about it , that unborn baby you just killed could have been the man who cured cancer , or the doctor who saved a dying baby , or the first female president ever .
So if I were to post a news article where someone says that pedophilia should be legalized , then it means I agree with them ? I thought this was a discussion board . That means we , you know , DISCUSS THINGS .
Nor is it 'natural selection ' at work either , as in both cases the thing that enabled them to survive was not natural . What you have advanced as a proof of evolution actually proves what ? Natural what ? I suppose people with cochlear implants are new species too because they 've learnt to hear .
You 'd have to explain why other developed nations with a lot less guns also have a much lower murder rate than the US .
How likely is that Kansas will succeed and also is the teaching of YEC likely to spread to other states ?
show me that evidence .
That 's because legal gun owners ( at least the majority of them ) , are n't criminals . They follow most gun laws .
it all depends on what exactly we would find . i dont think any of those questions are answerable ( apart from the last one ) because we dont even have a starting point . hell , we dont even know what to look for when it comes to evidence for ID .
Narcotics traffickers are acquiring firepower more appropriate to an army -- including grenade launchers and antitank rockets -- and the police are feeling outgunned . Reporting from Zihuatanejo , Mexico , and Mexico City -- It was a brazen assault , not just because it targeted the city 's police station , but for the choice of weapon : grenades . The Feb. 21 attack on police headquarters in coastal Zihuatanejo , which injured four people , fit a disturbing trend of Mexico 's drug wars . Traffickers have escalated their arms race , acquiring military-grade weapons , including hand grenades , grenade launchers , armor-piercing munitions and antitank rockets with firepower far beyond the assault rifles and pistols that have dominated their arsenals . Most of these weapons are being smuggled from Central American countries or by sea , eluding U.S. and Mexican monitors who are focused on the smuggling of semiauto- matic and conventional weapons purchased from dealers in the U.S. border states of Texas , New Mexico , Arizona and California . The proliferation of heavier armaments points to a menacing new stage in the Mexican government 's 2-year-old war against drug organizations , which are evolving into a more militarized force prepared to take on Mexican army troops , deployed by the thousands , as well as to attack each other . These groups appear to be taking advantage of a robust global black market and porous borders , especially between Mexico and Guatemala . Some of the weapons are left over from the wars that the United States helped fight in Central America , U.S. officials said . `` There is an arms race between the cartels , '' said Alberto Islas , a security consultant who advises the Mexican government . `` One group gets rocket-propelled grenades , the other has to have them . '' There are even more ominous developments : Authorities reported three thefts of several hundred pounds of blasting material from industrial explosives plants in Durango during a four-day period last month . Authorities believe the material may have been destined for car bombs or remotely detonated roadside devices , which have been used with devastating effect in Iraq , killing more than 1,822 members of U.S.-led forces since the war there began nearly six years ago . The Mexican army has recovered most of the material , and there has been no reported use of such devices . Grenades or military-grade weapons have been reported in at least 10 Mexican states during the last six months , used against police headquarters , city halls , a U.S. consulate , TV stations and senior Mexican officials . In a three-week period ended March 6 , five grenade attacks were launched on police patrols and stations and the home of a commander in the south-central state of Michoacan . Other such attacks occurred in five other states during the same period . At least one grenade attack north of the border , at a Texas nightclub frequented by U.S. police officers , has been tied to Mexican traffickers . How many weapons have been smuggled into Mexico from Central America is not known , and the military-grade munitions are still a small fraction of the larger arsenal in the hands of narcotics traffickers . Mexican officials continue to push Washington to stem the well-documented flow of conventional weapons from the United States , as Congress holds hearings on the role those smuggled guns play in arming Mexican drug cartels . There is no comprehensive data on how many people have been killed by heavier weapons . But four days after the assault on the Zihuatanejo police station , four of the city 's officers were slain in a highway ambush six miles from town on the road to Acapulco . In addition to the standard AK-47 and AR-15 assault rifles , the attackers fired at least six .50-caliber shells into the officers ' pickup . The vehicle blew up when hit by what experts believe was a grenade or explosive projectile . The bodies of the officers were charred . `` These are really weapons of war , '' said Alberto Fernandez , spokesman for the Zihuatanejo city government . `` We only know these devices from war movies . '' U.S. law enforcement officials say they detected the smuggling of grenades and other military-grade equipment into Mexico about a year and a half ago , and observed a sharp uptick in the use of the weapons about six months ago . The Mexican government said it has seized 2,239 grenades in the last two years , in contrast to 59 seized over the previous two years . The enhanced weaponry represents a wide sampling from the international arms bazaar , with grenades and launchers produced by U.S. , South Korean , Israeli , Spanish or former Soviet bloc manufacturers . Many had been sold legally to governments , including Mexico 's , and then were diverted onto the black market . Some may be sold directly to the traffickers by corrupt elements of national armies , authorities and experts say . The single deadliest attack on civilians by drug traffickers in Mexico took place Sept. 15 at an Independence Day celebration in the central plaza of Morelia , hometown of President Felipe Calderon and capital of Michoacan . Attackers hurled fragmentation grenades at the celebrating crowd , killing eight people and wounding dozens more . Amid the recent spate of attacks in Michoacan , federal police on Feb. 20 announced the discovery of 66 fragmentation grenades in the fake bottom of a truck intercepted in southern Mexico , just over the border from Guatemala . The two men arrested with the cargo told police they were transporting the grenades to Morelia . Grenades used in three attacks in Monterrey and Texas were linked to a single Monterrey warehouse , packed with explosives and high-caliber guns , reportedly belonging to the Gulf cartel . Mexican authorities raided the warehouse in October and seized the cache , which contained South Korean-manufactured grenades similar to the American M67 fragmentation grenade . Grenades from the same lot were used in a Jan. 6 attack on the Televisa television station in Monterrey , which caused damage but no injuries , and during an Oct. 12 attack against the U.S. Consulate in Monterrey . The device at the consulate did not detonate . Late on the night of Jan. 31 , a Saturday , a man tossed a grenade into the El Booty Lounge in Pharr , Texas . Three off-duty Texas police officers were there , though authorities would not say whether they were the target . The explosive , which did not detonate , was traced to the Monterrey warehouse . Traffickers using M203 40-millimeter grenade launchers last year attacked and killed eight Mexican federal police officers in Culiacan , the capital of Sinaloa state . In the northern border city of Nogales , the Sonora state police commander was killed Nov. 2 in an ambush by purported traffickers firing AK-47s and lobbing grenades . He had been returning from a meeting with U.S. authorities in Arizona to discuss gun smuggling . In the western state of Durango , three people , including a 3-year-old child , were killed in a grenade attack in January . The firepower has gone beyond grenades . Armed with light antitank weapons , would-be assassins went after the nation 's top counternarcotics prosecutor in December 2007 . The assailants were intercepted before they reached Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos , who was not hurt . The weapons seized were linked to the notorious Sinaloa cartel . `` They were betting on being able to escalate with a spectacular strike precisely to terrify society , '' Santiago Vasconcelos said at the time . ( He was killed in November in a plane crash . ) Beyond the weaponry , drug gangs for several years have demonstrated the ability to form squads and employ military tactics , including the use of assault rifles , hand grenades , grenade launchers and fully automatic weapons to pin down army forces . This has enabled them to attack army patrols frontally , as they did with lethal results Feb. 7 in the central state of Zacatecas , killing one sergeant and critically wounding a colonel . `` At this stage , the drug cartels are using basic infantry weaponry to counter government forces , '' a U.S. government official in Mexico said . `` Encountering criminals with this kind of weaponry is a horse of a different color , '' the official said . `` It 's not your typical patrol stop , where someone pulls a gun . This has all the makings of an infantry squad , or guerrilla fighting . '' The fear of guerrilla warfare was compounded in February when 270 pounds of dynamite and several hundred electric detonators were stolen from a U.S. firm in the state of Durango . On Valentine 's Day , about 20 masked gunmen , led by a heavyset man wearing gold rings and chains , stormed the warehouse of a subsidiary of Austin Powder Co. , an industrial explosives manufacturer , according to official accounts . They overpowered guards and emptied the warehouse . Two similar thefts were reported within four days in the same area . Although the Mexican army recovered most of the dynamite , the incident augurs an even bloodier trend , officials said . `` There is only one reason to have bulk explosives , '' said Thomas G. Mangan , spokesman in Phoenix for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives . `` An improvised explosive device . A car bomb . '' In addition to grenades , high-powered guns such as the .50-caliber Barrett sniper rifle have become a weapon of choice in narcotics traffickers ' arsenals , Mangan said . Unlike grenades and antitank weapons , the .50-caliber guns can be obtained by ordinary citizens in the U.S. and smuggled easily into Mexico , like the tons of assault rifles and automatic pistols . Mexican law enforcement , such as the police in Zihuatanejo , is grossly outgunned . Officers have protested , seeking better protective gear , weaponry and pay . Shortly after the Zihuatanejo attacks , police officers staged a brief work stoppage outside their headquarters , where scars from the grenade attack were still visible . One of the blasts left a cereal bowl-shaped divot in the stone pavement and pockmarks on the front of the police building . It went off 100 feet from the nearest street , prompting some officers to suspect that the assailants employed a grenade launcher . Police have piled sandbags 4 feet high around the compound and security is tight . Commanders have bought 10 bulletproof vests , but say they need at least 280 to equip the city 's 343 officers . The police commander , Pablo Rodriguez , said his officers are terrified . They are armed with semiautomatic .223-caliber rifles made in Italy , Germany and Mexico . The rifles , with folding stocks , are snazzy , but they are no match for the weapons being stockpiled by the drug cartels . `` They are good weapons , but to counteract the types of weapons they 're using against us , they 're not equal , '' Rodriguez said . His officers know they do n't stand a chance . Not five days after the highway attack that blew up the police truck , Rodriguez had jobs to fill . Twenty-two of his cops had abruptly quit .
( 3 ) Although Olson effectively demonstrates that there is no reasonable justification for prohibiting same-sex marriage , only 14 % of conservatives agree . What 's going on here ? The answer , as Olson intimates , is religion . Almost one-half of all conservatives believe that the Bible rather than the will of the People should determine public policy in the United States . Those who attend church services weekly supported Proposition 8 by a vote of 84 % to 16 % , whereas those who do not attend church regularly opposed Proposition 8 by a vote of 83 % to 17 % . Olson rejects `` religious teachings that denounce homosexuality as morally wrong '' and believes that the Constitution `` prohibits us from forcing our religious beliefs on others . '' But most conservatives do n't agree with him .

The term PACS stands for Pacte Civil de Solidarité , which was introduced into French law on 15 November 1999 . Put simply , a PACS is a contract signed by two people of the same sex or opposite sex , who are over 18 years old and want to organise their life together . Its an agreement that can not be entered into by two people who are part of the same family , who are already married or who are already part of a PACS . The contract  which can prepared by the parties themselves or by their lawyer - is registered together with all relevant documents at the registered office of the civil court in the area where the couple live . The couple are free to detail their obligations to each other in the contract . But in any case by law they are obliged to help and assist each other . The precise level of support is proportional to their income . The couple are jointly responsible for any debts incurred by the other through normal daily living  but not if those expenses are deemed excessive . All other debts remain an individuals personal responsibility . Unless the couple have decided to hold their assets in common according to the system of indivision - where each item bought after the PACS is signed is deemed to belong jointly to both of the partners - the estates of each partner remain separate . Each partner remains the owner of the assets he or she buys - and responsible for his or her debts . The main advantages of a PACS are concerned with tax . The pacsés as they are known in France benefit from being taxed as a couple - and not as two separate individuals . This can often reduce their overall income tax burden And since August 2007 , the surviving partner of a PACS benefits from the same inheritance tax regime as a surviving spouse in a married couple - which means there are no death duties to pay .
Why not ? There 's no rules that say faith and science must be separate .
The landscape analogy and collective `` decision-making '' are concepts unfamiliar to biologists , who have tended to focus on single genes acting in linear pathways . This made the work initially difficult to publish , notes Huang . `` It 's hard for biologists to move from thinking about single pathways to thinking about a landscape , which is the mathematical manifestation of the entirety of all the possible pathways , '' he says . `` A single pathway is not a good way to understand a whole process . Our goal has been to understand the driving force behind it . ''

How does a stem cell decide what specialized identity to adopt -- or simply to remain a stem cell ? A new study suggests that the conventional view , which assumes that cells are `` instructed '' to progress along prescribed signaling pathways , is too simplistic . Instead , it supports the idea that cells differentiate through the collective behavior of multiple genes in a network that ultimately leads to just a few endpoints -- just as a marble on a hilltop can travel a nearly infinite number of downward paths , only to arrive in the same valley .
This entire issue was dealt with on this threat here , starting at post 250 .
Well let 's see , from your `` EvC Forum '' link ; You gather information from other forums , then use it as bait on yet another forum ? Exactly how many forums do you belong to ? I would hope you would n't be too surprised that others sometimes ignore you . Is this your main activity in life ?
Would depend on how sucessful they thought the handing in was , but do n't you have to register for a leicence ? So all legal owners are know already and can be checked off against the guns they have handed in , I would imagine that there must be departments of the police who deal with tracking black market unregisted guns so these could be cracked down opon . In addition you would have to make possesion of a firearm illegal , then you have to balance defending your property with revealing you are commiting a crime ( will be fairly obvious if you use one and you would have to get rid of it anyway when forensics investigate the crime scene ) . Would also have to look at countries that have carried out sucessful ones to see if there are any little points or mistakes to pick up . If there is a lot of resistance you could make possesion of a gun attempted murder , would make people think very carefully whether they would want to carry them , especailly criminals- comunity service or light sentace for a mugging or long term prison sentance for attempted murder if they are carrying a gun while doing it , even in bank robbery they would likely think twice about the additional years .
Just a question for you - hypothetical What would happen if we took a bunch of people , stuck them on a planet with no access to any knowledge of God or Christ - and say we left them there for a couple hundred thousand years . Are they more likely to come to the conclusion that Genesis 1 & amp ; 2 happened , some other random story of religious creation , or something a little closer to what scientists have come up with ? Be honest !
5 ) Moving on , if we look teh other way , evolution is actually a theory not physically proven , one of it s theory suggested that human started out in Africa while another in Asia , but if u look at them none resembles the other and none have a characteristic of an animal .
The National Guard interpretation of the militia is totally false . The NG is a standing army . The militia is not . The NG can be federalized . The militia can not . They wear the same uniforms . The officers all know each other and play golf together . If the NG is the militia , then I want to have stock plies of weapons at schools , hospitals , libraries , and churches . No federalization of NG . Complete and total seperation of NG from federal influence , communication , and socializatlion , right down to even different uniforms .
Very often , it is irresponsible sexual practices or insufficiently responsible sex that leads to the unwanted pregnancies that lead to abortion . By reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies through proper contraceptive use ( including doubling up to reduce pregnancy risk ) or abstinence for those that can be convinced , one would then automatically reduce the number of abortions . I think this is one area where our two sides actually agree in the general idea that it would be good to reduce the number of abortions by reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies . Imagine what could be accomplished if our sides actually worked together in this direction . I think that the devil is in the details , though , in how each of our sides would work to achieve this . So , what are your views on how best to decrease the number of unwanted pregnancies and why do you hold those views ? Do you advocate teaching abstinence only ? Teaching proper contraceptive use in school ? Other ideas ?

Carmen , it 's senseless not to believe that Abortion is Planned Parenthood 's # 1 reccomendation . Does Planned Parenthood offer pregnancy support ? No . Do they offer ultrasounds ? No . Do they have maternity wards ? No . What do they do ? They give out pregnancy tests and do abortions . That 's where they get their money- a quarter of all their revenue is from pre 13-week abortions . This is not even countig their later more expensive abortons that are also so common ! They get $ 40 million a year for abortions alone .
and the conversion of hearts and minds so that the law would n't be needed .
You know what I find amusing here ... your entire argument revolves around how it will affect your wallet .

Fortunately , your beliefs are not facts .

The problem is that just as were coming to understand the importance of self-regulation skills , those skills appear to be in short supply among young American children . In one recent national survey , 46 percent of kindergarten teachers said that at least half the kids in their classes had problems following directions . In another study , Head Start teachers reported that more than a quarter of their students exhibited serious self-control-related negative behaviors , like kicking or threatening other students , at least once a week .
Of course I believe an unborn fetus is simply an unborn child . The only difference is that the unborn has no means of survival without the mother and is not recognized as being a living person . I do n't wish that this child should be killed , but as I said before it can be for the best . And if you really do believe in heaven , then the child is going there anyways . Why would you wish a life of suffering on it instead of being able to skip all that and go straight to heaven ? This is the type of logic that works against those who believe in a soul since it really does n't make much sense to live on Earth when heaven is a million billion times better . Just to answer your question with a question , how do you know a child would choose life over death when it has never lived ? People commit suicide everyday but I 'm sure they would also choose life over death if they had been in a better situation . Perhaps this is being too extreme . A person would likely choose to live when faced with death , but whether it logically make sense is another question . People will try to live through starvation , sickness , and misery because it is what their mind tells them to do . Is it really best that they are alive ?
It is much more important that you concern yourself with the destiny of your soul , not how many years you can stay on the earth .

I 've never heard of A Framer is , but that quote by Samuel Adams was an amendment that Samuel Adams proposed to the Massachusetts Ratifying Convention .

I do know that 's it 's true . There 's a mountain of verifiable evidence backing up evolution , some of which has been pointed out to you . I 've never heard of anything that contradicts evolution , and I 've never heard a better theory for explaining the evidence . So aside from the fact that it 's true , what good does the theory of evolution do me ? It explains why diseases act the way they do , how people got to be the way they are now , what impact humans might have on the environment , what the long term impact of global climate change is likely to be . Just to name a few off the top of my head .

I would like to address the theory of evolution point-by-point . Since I do not want to misrepresent the theory , I have used an explanation of Darwin 's theory from Gould 's book , `` Full House . '' On page 138 , Gould states : 1 ) All organisms tend to produce more offspring than can possibly survive . 2 ) Offspring vary among themselves , and are not carbon copies of an immutable type . 3 ) This variation is passed down by inheritance to future generations . ( We know that black folks have black kids ; white folks , white kids ; tall parents tend to have tall children ; and so on . ) 4 ) If many offspring must die ( for not all can be accommodated in nature 's limited ecology ) , and individuals in all species vary among themselves , then on average survivors will tend to be those individuals with variations that are fortuitously best suited to changing local environments . Since heredity exists , the offspring of survivors will tend to resemble their successful parents . The accumulation of these favorable variants through time will produce evolutionary change .

To the Editor : Re The Sex Speech ( column , June 12 ) : Nicholas D. Kristof recognizes the depth of racism and the breadth of sexism in the United States . But nonwhite women in this country face both , and suffer real consequences as a result : African-American women are four times more likely than white women to die in childbirth . The United States ranks first among developed nations in the number of women who die because of pregnancy-related complications . Every woman has the right to survive pregnancy . There is no reason , as Mr. Kristof notes , that the United States should not be a leader in making this basic human right a reality . That means financing reproductive health services , from contraception to maternal health care . What better way to address the intersection of racism and sexism and to repair Americas standing in the world than to save women from dying during pregnancy , whether they live in an African village or Greenwich Village ?

You see , I could replace any mumbo jumbo made up stuff and replace the placebo with it . Then by your logic , we could prove anything has an effect on anything else IN COMBINATION with something that actually works ( you know , logical AND )
Is that really the case ? I do n't think so . Look at the actual benefits given to married people . Are any of them actually about recognizing a relationship between a man and a woman ? No , they 're not . They 're all about making it easier to build a home , a family , and a life together . That 's the real intent of the marriage laws , and there 's nothing about building a life together that requires the participants to be of differing genders .

This judge stated that it was UN-Constitutional ( according to California Constitution ) to limit marriage to opposite-gender couples . So . . . . . why did we vote in 2000 on the definition of marriage ? And since the majority stated that marriage was between one man and one woman - why was that not taken into consideration with this ruling ? Why is it that when the people speak their voice , it is IGNORED ? ? Not only the mayor of SF - but this Superior Court judge as well ?
If the representatives of the people betray their constituents , there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that original right of self-defense which is paramount to all positive forms of government , and which against the usurpations of the national rulers , may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual state . In a single state , if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers , the different parcels , subdivisions , or districts of which it consists , having no distinct government in each , can take no regular measures for defense . The citizens must rush tumultuously to arms , without concert , without system , without resource ; except in their courage and despair . The usurpers , clothed with the forms of legal authority , can too often crush the opposition in embryo . The obstacles to usurpation and the facilities of resistance increase with the increased extent of the state , provided the citizens understand their rights and are disposed to defend them .

Yes , I was a fetus , and at that point in time I was NOT technically a human being . I had the potential to become a human being but I was n't not one . I was human cells dividing .
Because you know that the living chimpanzee that shares 98 % of our genetic code , and is living evidence that such shared DNA is in no way evidence of human descent at all completely nullifies and negates all of the claims made by evolutionists that these genetic markers in long dead animals could possibly ever be proven to be our ancestors .
Quite frankly , you do n't know squat about me . So stop trying to pretend you do . I have gone on record to say I think Christianity does a lot of good in the world .

Behemoth has the following attributes according to Job 40:15-24 It eats grass like an ox. It moves his tail like a cedar. ( In Hebrew , this literally reads , he lets hang his tail like a cedar. ) Its bones are like beams of bronze , His ribs like bars of iron. He is the first of the ways of God. He lies under the lotus trees , In a covert of reeds and marsh. Job 40:15-24 ( New International Version ) 15 `` Look at the behemoth , [ a ] which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox . 16 What strength he has in his loins , what power in the muscles of his belly ! 17 His tail [ b ] sways like a cedar ; the sinews of his thighs are close-knit . 18 His bones are tubes of bronze , his limbs like rods of iron . 19 He ranks first among the works of God , yet his Maker can approach him with his sword . 20 The hills bring him their produce , and all the wild animals play nearby . 21 Under the lotus plants he lies , hidden among the reeds in the marsh . 22 The lotuses conceal him in their shadow ; the poplars by the stream surround him . 23 When the river rages , he is not alarmed ; he is secure , though the Jordan should surge against his mouth . 24 Can anyone capture him by the eyes , [ c ] or trap him and pierce his nose ?

There is nothing about the theory of relativity , nor the theory of gravity , nor the theory that the earth is round that precludes the existence of a Creator God . In reality , God may or may not exist . Some people believe God exists . Others do not believe God exists . Neither view can be proven based on physical evidence . Both are beliefs only . Though one of those beliefs must necessarily be true .
How many threads are you planning on creating regarding this event , Simone ? This is already your second .
I see far to many religious people that know absolutely nothing about the universe they live in as a result .
What I am is someone who appreciates the value of the scientific methodology , and its repeatedly demonstrated power to yield elegant , testable , useful and predictive hypotheses , including - over the past centuries - the discovery and modeling of novel forces at work in nature as well as the Theory of Evolution .
Direct evidence for allele frequency change is freely available for all to see .
Then they do things like lobby Congress to reduce the budget of the ATF according to Bob Ricker , a former lawyer of the NRA who turned against the organization .
So you 're a perfect clone of one your parents with zero copying errors ? Amazing .
Then go away . If you have no interest , then why on earth are you even here to debate ? Besides this , you 're trying to put killing human beings on the same platform as animals or organic plant life . I 'd seriously suggest you reconsider your views on what exactly is more important . You can not put those things together , they mix about as well as oil and water . If the court or parental unit is not allowed to interfere with abortion plans , does the mother have the right to kill the child ? Who is she to interfere with her child 's life if her own parents ca n't make her live with a baby she can just give up for adoption ? By the way , only 1 % of abortions are made because of rape . If it were my decision , I would outlaw abortion altogether for the other 99 % who have abortions irresponsibly and save over a million lives . Do n't get me wrong , I do feel for victims of such crimes , but a few thousand hardly outweighs over a million . And they do n't even have to die ! They just have to live with a baby for a few months , and they can get on with their lives ! It 's more of a chance than the baby will get otherwise .
During these millions of years , they will be undeveloped , simply masses attached to the dinosaur , and totally useless .
Not only can the qualifications of judges to evaluate such studies be seriously questioned , but leaving such matters to the discretion of judges could result in a serious imbalance of government powers .
maybe you can postpone it one more week and think about it for one more week , and talk to others that love you ( your boyfriend does not count ) . In the event you keep your appointment on Saturday , all I can say is Im sorry , that you have to go through this event . I hope you will be okay .
I do n't think we have any , sorry . Our gun control advocates have surrendered , finding that their argument is so flawed that it is absolutely insupportable . Those who advocated less than lethal weapons have also been proven fools . Less than lethal weapons have been proven to be less than effective weapons . If you are in a situation where you have to use a weapon , you want a weapon that you KNOW will stop the bad guy , not a weapon that you think has a high probability of stopping the bad guy .
as far as evolution itself , teaching the fact and effect of evolution is a good thing , since it does fall under science . the other theories , thats another matter ...
Why are there people who want to tack away my guns ? I have an `` assault rifle '' , an assault shotgun , and hand guns . All three of these types of guns are under attack and I would like to know why you ( voice of reason , and others ) think that they should be off the streets or banned ?
I seriously hope that you do n't believe for a second that the snout of the Platypus is a duck 's bill . You do know that , right ?
Creationists and evolutionists , Christians and non-Christians all have the same evidencethe same facts . Think about it : we all have the same earth , the same fossil layers , the same animals and plants , the same starsthe facts are all the same . The difference is in the way we all interpret the facts . And why do we interpret facts differently ? Because we start with different presuppositions . These are things that are assumed to be true , without being able to prove them . These then become the basis for other conclusions . All reasoning is based on presuppositions ( also called axioms ) . This becomes especially relevant when dealing with past events .
How can you tell the difference ?
Although I dont live in Virginia I appreciate you throwin that document up there . Is there a link to the Pennsylvania laws like that..that was very informative
Our world is rolling downhill like a giant bolder [ sic ] rolling down a mountainside .
Well ... . okay . But what 's so funny about it ?
Yes , our usage of those terms does differ markedly . You employ what I would call a narrative interpretation : design as a means to an end , contrasted with evolution having no ultimate goal .
I have already proved the Big Bang to be a big dud , so we need not go over this subject again ( unless Raastee or anyone else has objective evidence for this theory .
Notice how the places where guns are banned have the most massacres . Those who instituted laws preventing people on campus from defending themselves should be held partially liable for these crimes .
If they remain striaight then it 's they were never really gay . Talk about biases .
So these arguments I get from the likes of you and Iangb which argue that until a child shows mental awareness , it is n't actually a person deserving of human rights is a bogus and shortsighted position according to the scriptural point of view . Of that , there is no question .
We are n't that rich , and both of us our still finishing up our college degrees and are under enormous student loan burden . He supported my decision to abort as neither of us would have anywhere near the time or money to support a baby ( hence our use of contraception ) , and neither of us have taken a full job in our fields yet to be able to provide that money to pay for the loans let alone a child .
There are those that believe that mechanistic evolution ca n't explain for all of life 's systems .
There is just one thing however . The coelacanths found are different from those in the fossil record . Further , ALL evidence pointed to them being extinct , until we found other evidence , and we changed it . And , to top it off , the article says NEARLY extinct , not COMPLETELY . Although , this article was of course written after the coelocanths were re-discovered . Of course , this has absolutely nothing to do with the theory of evolution , which explains the mechanisms responsible for the change of allele frequencies in populations over time .
If the biblical lesson one is intended to take from the story of Sodom and Gomorrah were applied to a bath house or any service business it would eventually go BK . The two cities were not condemned because of rampant homosexual activities , you of course know this , it has been explained to you , it has been shown to you , but when you want to be right nothing else matters . Why is it that modern Christians have an undeniable obsession regarding homosexuals ? Jesus obviously did n't consider it worth mentioning , but he did have a problem with divorce . Yet that is a protected right . The Holy Mother Church will disobey Jesus and grant divorce , but holds on tight to another misinterpretation . The blind leading the blind in blissful ignorance . How pist will you be having to spend some time in the pit because of something like this ? Oh and unwarranted hatred while not specifically stated as a sin undermines society faster with more tangible and lasting effects than if you just got over it . Hey maybe if you ignore them they will go away . Try it and see if it works .
By the way , if you are in the least bit intellectually honest , I challenge you to actually act on any of those doubts about the reality of existence and any other reality that we understand from all human experience . Otherwise , if you never act on those doubts , you are simply being hypocritical .
[ /b ] Evolutionist keep chanting that the `` god of the gaps '' is used to fill in where `` science '' can not . This is their words as nothing science has `` proven '' overturns anything the Bible says . Most scientist agree is not proof . Many times most scientist are wrong . Even if some stupid Christians subscribe to the god of the gaps nonsense it would be the pot calling the kettle black .
After reading the other posts in this thread , I will not agree to a debate without pre-defined definitions either . I 'm open to new definitions , but this debate should not be a debate over what atheism or evolution means .
`` The belief that there are approximately 20,000 gun-control laws in the United States has become received wisdom ... .. But as it turns out , there appears to be little basis for the number ... .
Why ? Because police cars attached to the Washington MPDs Civil Disturbance Unit had escorted the SEIU protesters buses to Baers home . Such cross-jurisdictional escort activity is not uncommon for both departments according to Friz and Metro Police Department spokesperson Officer Eric Frost . Still , the District police did not inform their colleagues of what was about to happen in one of their Maryland neighborhoods .
Anchorage Daily News , Anchorage , Alaska , 11/4/2006 WHEN MATTHEW SCHNEIDER pulled into his driveway and got out of his truck , three teenagers approached and began an altercation . According to authorities , Schneider told the youths to vacate his property , but they began assaulting him , even slamming the truck door on his head . Schneider , who has a concealed carry permit , reached for his .4o pistol and fired twice at his assailants . `` I thought they were going to kill me if I did n't do something , '' Schneider said . Two suspects fled , one of them wounded , while a third collapsed . Schneider says he prayed for the fallen suspect to survive , but he died at the scene
Hmm , yeah , I never got sadness from a dove 's call . { shrug } Well , more familiar animals , like our domesticated pals show their emotions all the time . Dogs are full of emotion . Just leave the house and they get instantly depressed . Seperation anxiety in dogs is profound . I know my dog expresses his utter joy every time I grab the leash . He knows we 're going somewhere besides the boring house . If he sees me playing with another dog or giving the other dog a treat , he 'll get really jealous and you can tell .
and decided to scrape you out . Think about all the things you enjoy now , they would never happenif your mother decided to just throw you away . Abortion is inhumane , and iresponsible . If you made a child through sex , then is on you to keep it .

however , like alcohol , it is impossible to convince someone addicted about how their addiction hurts them .
With all the medical technology a child should be born and the mother survive .
But besides that `` opinion '' , it does effect me because it effects society in a negative way . Do you just choose to ignore the studies on the terrible emotional and physical problems women have after they have abortions ?
do n't think any of them think that gives them the licence to rape , kill , murder or be the next Hitler . The idea that judeo/christian believers have the copyrights to moral living and obediance to societies laws , is a pure and arrogant fallacy .

The criminalization of abortion was the real abuse of power . It was mostly done by a few sexist and political oppertunist members of the AMA to stop women from practicing medicine and by xenophobic/racist Protestant groups who feared a non-white/non-Protestant majority here in America after the Civil War cleared out many of them .
Yeah of course it 's good for relationships , being religious does n't mean abstaining from sex ( ... ..in most religions ) . I 'm just saying that if you 're religious you 're more likely to keep sex for relationships and taking it more seriously ( as aposed to having sex with someone you 've just met at a nightclub/party while you were drunk ) . Yeah , I gues criminalization would make it worse in this day and age , but like I said , in a perfect world casual sex would be minimised and overpopulation ( through unwanted pregnancies ) would be too . But , we do n't live in a perfect world and there is more to overpopulation issue than the above .

I agree that extreme risks to health should be sufficient reason for abortion , whereas normal health risks should not . As with most things , the gray region in between can be the hardest to judge . You are probably right that judging on a case by case basis is best . Jim 's trucking brought up a good point that it is important to take into account whether the health risk would impair the mother 's ability to take care of other children . I agree with that judgement . Enough of these considerations put together might start forming some sort of framework for making decisions on that gray region .
and you win the PINK PANTIES award ! I got news for you PUNK - my family fled the Nazi 's on foot in WWII
Science , like religon , is just another way to see the world .
So what ? Some of the greatest crimes in history have been led by people of faith . Take the Crusades for one , the religious knights killed every last man , women , and child in Jerusalem . It does n't discredit Christianity does it ?
You assume that policemen are trustworthy . I believe the question should be , `` Why do we trust policemen more than others ? '' I believe the bell shaped curve applies to all large groups of people . There are likely just as many dishonest cops as there are dishonest non-cops , based on a percentage of their group .

The brain is the fundamental unit of life  yet evolutionists attempt to explain life by completely ignoring it . I dont buy it ... .and you evolutionists are all outmatched by common sense .
According to your logic , an infant would have no right to suck nutrients from a woman 's breast . Would you as quickly assert the mother has no duty to care for the infant ?
But a fetus in the womb is far more important than the lives and health of these women .
BS . Where is the raw data ... The link you show is from www.gunowners.org over there and does not give links to the raw data so it is probably skewed to make themselves look better . Your own words condemn you
A more logical explanation is that there may have been racist gun laws during a certain time period but gun control is n't inherently racist .
Good point . Touche . Though lots of folks have not had abortions . Certainly most men have not . I was just growing tired of a certain little poster 's uninformed opinions of sexual activity . My post was intended to be a little playful . If it missed the mark , mea culpa .
This would also explain why evolutionists can not give us any example of random mutations that could lead to cumulative selection -- because they do n't exist . S
I know it 's almost as silly as thinking gay marriage will undermine heterosexual marriage .
By definition , a theory is an explanation of observed facts and laws . It is supported by experiments upon which it is based , and is confirmed by experiments designed to test predictions based on the explanation . Now where in that definition is the word fact either used or implied ?
Doesnt look like getting rid of gun control is DC is working out so well
No , it does n't make it right but it 's not right to treat women as breeding animals either .
Even though the Bible is not a scientific text book and does n't purport to be , nowhere is it scientifically inaccurate . In addition , many of the scientific ideas you are so impressed with are nothing new to the Bible . It was speaking of these things long before modern science spoke of them .
If there are many people reading this that already believe in evolution , or for that matter , believe in biblical creationism , then it is important to keep in mind that the people appealing to science have biases at work , regardless of how objectively rationalistic they present themselves .
A newborn baby can not think mentally like an adult , but does that make him/her a less valuable life ? if a woman is raped , and a two year old is raped , is it not an equally bad crime considering the two year old did n't understand what was happening ? I have the same view on abortion .
All of those quotes are from leading evolutionist . Of course you are more informed than they are n't you ?
No , and your classification here is rediculous . This is not a matter of refusing to serve sombody based on their religon .
What if my own words and feeling sound just like that dusty book ? What if I happen to agree with it ? What if I take it in context ? Actually one would be hard pressed to show where I have ever taken it out of context . If I say that I worship Him because he is powerful , beautiful and has loved me greatly , does that mean you now get to argue those points and say he is not any of those . I would say you do not get to argue my assumptions about God as they are mine . YOu may argue my conclusions based on my assumptions but you could not argue my assumptions , nor I yours . Is that a fair statement of how to answer the question ?
I 'm not even going to bother with your non-sequitor , but I imagine plenty of alcohol manufacturers enjoy the occasional drink .

Next , Dr. Lipton destroys any notion that our genes control us : `` ... ..the media repeatedly distort the meaning of two words : correlation and causation . It 's one thing to be linked to a disease ; it 's quite another to cause a disease , which implies a directing , controlling action . If I show you my keys and say that a particular key `` controls '' my car , you at first might think that makes sense because you know you need that key to turn on the ignition . But does the key actually `` control '' the car ? If it did , you could n't leave the key in the car alone because it might just borrow your car for a joy ride when you are not paying attention . In truth , the key is `` correlated '' with the control of the car ; but the person who actually turns the key actually controls the car . Specific genes are correlated with an organism 's behavior and characteristics . But these genes are not activated until something triggers them . ''
Is it possible that the `` rigidity '' of many evangelical churches and what they expect of their members drives couples to divorce when one partner is n't as `` on board '' as the other ? Many people have only joined these churches of late and were already married when they did . Just thinkin ' .
I think the semi-tragic error supersport - and other strongly religious people - make when triumphantly posting links like this is that he assumes everyone invests their beliefs concerning the universe with the same degree of emotion and self-worth as he does . This assumption is explicitly stated on occasion , whenever 'darwinism ' or evolution or some other scientific field of study is described as a 'religion ' . To SS , the most unpleasant and unwelcome thing imaginable is for evidence to be presented that contradicts ones beliefs . The idea that someone could respond to an upheaval or revolution in our understanding with excitement , anticipation or delight is entirely foreign to him .
Let 's substitute the words `` so-called Pro Lifers '' for `` anti gunners , shall we ?
I disagree . They are all effective methods of deterring crime . I will concede that guns can also be effective , but none of these is 100 % effective at removing the risk . This is why I do not understand the need to own a gun , when in most cases other methods can be effective .
but then you have to dump all your ( secular ) `` scientific '' theories in there aswell .
well theres no reason . 1 you can make your own magazines if you really want to go on a rampage , same with full autos , grenades , and armor pircing/explosive rounds ( though thats pretty hard ) it should go the same for cops , what about that guy that pulled out his wallet in ny , the cops shot him not 1ce but something like 30 times . how about make laws that makes all cops pistol double-action only that way maybe there fingers will get sore before they squezze off 30 rnds .
It turns out , the Johns Hopkins researchers say , that the ribosome exerts far tighter quality control than anyone ever suspected over its precious protein products which , as workhorses of the cell , carry out the very business of life . `` What we now know is that in the event of miscoding , the ribosome cuts the bond and aborts the protein-in-progress , end of story , '' says Rachel Green , a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and professor of molecular biology and genetics in the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine . `` There 's no second chance . '' Previously , Green says , molecular biologists thought the ribosome tightly managed its actions only prior to the actual incorporation of the next building block by being super-selective about which chemical ingredients it allows to enter the process . Because a protein 's chemical `` shape '' dictates its function , mistakes in translating assembly codes can be toxic to cells , resulting in the misfolding of proteins often associated with neurodegenerative conditions . Working with bacterial ribosomes , Green and her team watched them react to lab-induced chemical errors and were surprised to see that the protein-manufacturing process did n't proceed as usual , getting past the error and continuing its `` walk '' along the DNA 's protein-encoding genetic messages . `` We thought that once the mistake was made , it would have just gone on to make the next bond and the next , '' Green says . `` But instead , we noticed that one mistake on the ribosomal assembly line begets another , and it 's this compounding of errors that leads to the partially finished protein being tossed into the cellular trash , '' she adds .
Evolution is only a theory , and thus it shall remain . If a theory ca n't be proven in 150 years , there is very little possibility that it will ever be proven . I urge you to continue to seek the truth , start with the Bible .
lol ... .With regard to slavery , the Civil War was fought to establish the principle that `` All men ( persons ) are created equal . ''

I agree . People complain about imports but then buy them . People complain about the little toys in Wal-Mart being made by cheap labor while they drive their imported cars . What a bunch of hypocrites . Dont they realize that their ONE car is about as valuable as the whole toy department ( or close to it ) . Many of these same people have a Toyota and Honda in the garage and complain about jobs going overseas .
It seems the issue of hypermutational states is very much open to question . One of the articles linked above includes this thought-provoking section : In other words , a cell trying to 'survive , thrive and reproduce ' via a self-induced state of stochastic hypermutation would most likely just end up killing itself ...
Look , you can get mad at the President for ignoring public opinion polls . That 's perfectly fine . But I simply wanted to point out that this is not merely a Republican phenomenon .

How were they able to get an `` aggravated assault '' charge pinned on you ? I 'm assuming she never had a mark on herself to show the cops . Had you two had a previous domestic call history with the police ? Hopefully justice will be served when you get your day in court . Then you 'll get to experience the wonder that is `` family court '' , if you have n't already . You have my sympathies .
Therefore , I believe that God designed Finch brains to be able to subconsciously decipher when the environment changes and when a modified beak is needed . Likewise I believe God made it so peppered moths are able to modify their wing-patterns based on environment or background colors . This is no more unbelievable than the fact that a fish can change colors or that a snail can grow a bigger shell in the presence of predators . It all comes from the same creative Designer . And whats funny is evolutionists  in one breath  will tell you how they do not deny plasticity .yet in the next breath will tell you thats not how finches and moths changed ! If these people were intellectually honest , they wouldnt talk out of both side of their mouths like that they would admit the truth . But I no longer expect the truth out of atheists .
Apparently pretty narrow interpretation , and not one of the `` priviledges and immunities '' of citizens . Handguns for the purposes of lawful self-defense in the home . That appears to be what the Second Amendment now protects .
To me , viability , sentience , the development of the nervous system and the brain , and the experience of pain in a fetus during the third trimester begin to mark the ethical boundaries . But those , too , as indicators , are not absolute . And the woman comes first . It 's between her and her physician . It 's not my job to judge whether she suffered appropriately enough or not .
The propaganda is obvious . The guidebook encourages docents to proclaim their evolutionary faith with boldness and confidence : Be polite but firm. Practice . Your credibility is higher , and youll be more comfortable , when you sound like you know what youre talking about . Rehearse answers to the most frequently asked questions .

No disrespect intended in that I agree with you in that `` he '' is real to you , just as Santa is to children whose parents told them there is a REAL Santa . Just as you were told when you were very young . Santa also affects the lives of children in a very positive way just like you imaginary god does .
You 're a bit late there , are n't you ? Marriage has become a state institution as much as a religious one , and I see no practical way to undo that at this point .
Why then is this not taught in history classes ? Why are we taught AS FACT that Homer wrote them ?
And yet , even though creationists ask for detailed lists of every creature in transition over a period of several million years , I have never found a single creationist who can trace his ancestors back to Adam , a period of only about 6,000 years . The best I can do is to trace my ancestors back to the 1600s .

This forum is starting to get a little bit boring and is using up to much of my time .
First off , to the people who have reply 'd to the origal post . It is unfare of you to blame the state for a girls mistake . A 13 year old who has sex in the first place does not have the maturity to even understand how stupid that is ! I agree that she is not very smart but do n't be so judgmental , you do n't know what her life is like or what she has gone through . Also , in the custody of the state , do you really think she has the means to have and raise the child who would no doubtedly end up in the same cycle as the young mother ? As a young parent myself , not 13 but still young , I whole heartedly agree that if the girl want 's an abortion , she should be able to have one . And she is going to have one because the state is allowing her to have one . For the young girls near future , i hope that the state will put her in some therapy and help her understand that she is too young to have sex .
( 6 ) Natural selection supposedly accounts for the development of new kinds , but actually tends to preserve the present kinds , since an incipient organ or new feature of any kind would have no `` survival '' value unless it were fully functional from its very beginning .
This is the situation as it is in Britain .
The main creationist lie is that people use evolution in our current society as an excuse to do bad things . Sorry folks I have never met somebody that does this so bringing it up just convinces me you are a liar .
I started it because it 's information . As far as line in the sand thats what it seems to me to be . Do you have a diffrent take on it ? I do though agree with their stance . That they swore an oath to the constitution not to the politicans .

why do n't you tell us how looking at an organism as a holistic whole , a whole that interacts with and evolves with a changing environment supports your theory .

In abstract , it might be tempting to imagine that irreducible complexity simply requires multiple simultaneous mutations -- - that evolution might be far chancier than we thought , but still possible . Such an appeal to brute luck can never be refuted . Yet it is an empty argument . One may as well say that the world luckily popped into existence yesterday with all the features it now has . Luck is a metaphysical speculation ; scientific explanations invoke causes.

Most of their mothers died giving birth or soon after  something that , in poor countries , leaves newborns at great risk of dying , too . The children are here just temporarily , to get a start in life so they can return to their villages and their extended families when they are 2 or 3 years old , well past the fragile days of infancy and big enough to digest cows milk and eat regular food .
That men would vote on a law that can place a womens ' life in peril , is beyond me .
You wrongly use Occam 's Razor as well . If the document is well preserved , has many copies , has copies relatively close to the original , etc , then the most likely assumption we can make is that the document itself is a valid source . Then and only then , should we examine the contents within and determine if they happened . We can do this through archaeological evidences and from other writings as well that agree with that one . Much of which we in fact do not have for many of Caesar 's expeditions , but yet again , we accept them as fact in our history books . But , it is funny that you should mention Caesar splitting a river . While he did n't do that , he did claim to have created a massive bridge in a very short time period and then destroyed it a few days later . Sounds like a pretty audacious claim from guys without any modern equipment . Should we discount this too because it 'does n't seem practical ' as we do with the bible despite the overwhelming documentation for it ? But here you are admitting that you set different standards 'depending on what the writing claims ' . Thanks again for proving my point I guess .
`` Professor . All previous attempts to explain how the process works have failed . Since no-one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and can not even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor , are you not teaching your opinion , sir ? Are you now not a scientist , but a priest ? ''
1 ) All organisms tend to produce more offspring than can possibly survive .
Yet there is arguably a morality component to every law ever to be put on the books .
Do you think that being allowed to marry your favorite sheep would undermine the institution of marriage ?
`` That may be true , but it is n't harmful so I doubt it really should be on the list . ''
That is a good point that you raise , however , in the fact that most people are just too busy in day to day life to consider something like this .
DOH ! yah beat me to it ! I 'll elaborate with the Zardoz answer : Stupid people want other stupid people to believe in their stupid belief systems and when they find non-stupid people , they have a coniption fits because they 're too stupid to understand that their beliefs are stupid . Simple version : Stupid is as Stupid does Come be stupid with us .
So , what is the current treatment and how effective is it ? Obviously it is more COST effective . We dont know what the current treatment is , or how effective it is , because what you posted here is a one sided opinion piece masquerading as a news article , and you ate it up .
LASTLY ID LIKE TO SAY WHY DONT WE STOP AND ASK THE ABORTED BABIES WHAT THEY THINK ON ABORTION ... ... hmm we cant
people keep saying thats the law in texas , so Im saying that this is the law in New York , He broke the law so he had it coming , next time dont disrespect the law and get a license , Im just showing how some of the people on this board are major hypocrites , you suddenly get all soft on crime when you dont like the law ,
I think that 's enough to start us out .
I have been reading some of the replies on this page , and yes there is a very new valid way that creationists can explain the fact that we see stars that are billions of light years away in a universe that is thousands of years old . This problem is appearently solved by Dr Russell Humphreys new `` Relativistic Cosmology '' in which he out lines in the book `` Starlight and Time . ''
However , all I wanted to state is that truth is not reliant on scientific evidence .
Sigma , I was only joking . It hit me this morning though that if I 'm willing to talk about abortion without bringing up God , I wonder if the Pro-Choicers could argue their position without bringing up `` women 's rights '' . ; - )
The funny thing about all this , and the oh-so-ironic thing is this :
This collected evidence will be used against suspects without thier permission . The crime fighting tool you just described violates 2 rights in one sweep . That is a very scary power given to police .
This is why science needs the Neanderthals be a different species and to go extinct
Interesting that those three are also the weakest and rarest of arguments when arguing for gun control . In fact , I have never witnessed anyone basing their entire gun control argument on the fact that `` gun owners lack the testicular fortitude to fight someone in hand-to-hand combat . ''
It appears to me , that if slavery had been put up to a vote in Texas back before the civil war , and Texans voted to add an amendment to their state constitution legalizing slavery of blacks ( which they would have ) , you could as simply say `` Maybe , just maybe , the reason that many American people think slavery of blacks is right is simply because it IS . ''
everything . it states that you can not discriminate against people even if they have a disorder . and if you prohibit people from getting married because they have a disorder , thats discrimination
My side of the debate is that a chicken is a bird but sometimes you have to break a few eggs to make an omelette ! ! ASL ! ?
Big question mark !
Believers ; even if people who do n't believe in creation and say that we ca n't prove it , so what ! ! ! We believe and have our faith ! ! Thats what matters ! ! And for people that do n't believe , think about this . If the `` big bang '' created matter than were did the stuff needed to make the `` big bang '' come from ?
Is that why there are tens of thousands of `` Christian '' religions ?
For God 's sake , let us freely hear both sides !
More slippery slope paranoia ...
Oh well , you 'll most likely insult me .
I am a gay Christian woman , live in Northern CA , and am VERY happily MARRIED to my wife as of June of 2008 . It is NOT a sin to be GLBT ...
The last guy who owned the gun legally is a good place to start . If there 's a stolen weapon report , so be it . If there 's not , we investigate certainly and prosecute if the law allows . Remember I support mandatory theft/loss reporting .
Ah , how icky the hypocrisy smells . Louisiana Republican Senator David Vitter , one of the leading proponents of a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage , has just apologized for his `` serious sin '' after his phone number appeared in the records of a DC Madam who ran an escort/prostitution service . Vitter had this to say of his connection to the prostitution service : `` This was a very serious sin in my past for which I am , of course , completely responsible . Several years ago , I asked for and received forgiveness from God and my wife in confession and marriage counseling . Out of respect for my family , I will keep my discussion of the matter there-with God and them . But I certainly offer my deep and sincere apologies to all I have disappointed and let down in any way . '' During his campaign for the U.S. Senate , Vitter had been accused of going to a prostitute , a charge that he then vigorously denied . Now , of course , he 's been caught , and he admits it . Meanwhile , Vitter expressed strong support last year for a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage . He compared same-sex marriage to hurricanes Katrine and Rita . He said , `` I do n't believe there 's any issue that 's more important than this one . '' It is always amazing when the self-proclaimed defenders of supposedly traditional marriage , the politicians who bolster their campaigns by appealing to popular anti-gay prejudice , are exposed for the hypocrites they are . In this case , this conservative Christian who campaigned against gay rights just could n't keep his own pants zipped . And to make sure he got elected , he lied about it until he was caught .
A ) Basic law 101 : you can be driving by the time you 're 15 and a half . We are speaking mostly of 16 and 17 year old girls . Many of which cars and jobs .
That is amazing . I find it crazy that this baby is much younger and smaller and far less developed than many of the babies that are aborted . Abortion is murder .
Then you have mutations , which are all either neutral or deleterious .
Substantially , that logic dictates that much of radioactivity should n't be taught as we did n't come up with it . If we decided based on heritage what we should teach in science , we 'd be leaving out vast amounts of chemistry , biology and physic from science .
Astronomers have debated Arp 's assertion that quasars are related to peculiar galaxies since the late 1960 's .
Montalban Why do you find it necessary to misrepresent what everyone says ? The traditions of this country are separation of church and state . John Kerry and I both object to attempts by some to impose their religion on everyone . Part of that religion is to make abortion illegal . Please try to stay on topic and refrain from misrepresentation in the future .
Mr. Jack , Abortion does n't have to be done if the amniotic sack is cut . An abortion never has to be done .
BTW , science is n't the `` evil work of Satan '' . It 's man 's way of trying to explain something so that they do n't have to believe in something that threatens the way they enjoy living . ( The Bible . )

As for Irreducible complex structures , one thing you have yet to understand , even though it has been explained to you at least a dozen times , is there are two methods for ic structures to evolve naturally , and indeed it has been shown this is the case
After all , all of them are shooting fellow students , right ? So how do they know who the shooter is if EVERYONE is shooting ? Who knows what kind of massive gun fight such a thing could turn into .
But Miller is with Jesus ( and by extension , you ) : he says that God exists and that Christianity is true . Or , if you insist that he 's against you , you 're left with this conundrum : You call Miller and theistic evolutionists incorrect , and he calls you and anti-evolutionists incorrect ; why is your position any more logical than his ?
Our state 's most avid anti-gunner politician is trying to make it a requirement that serving military members appear in person to renew their concealed weapons permits . She also has a new bill to introduce assualt weapon bans almost identical to The Republic of Kalifornia 's existing legislation . It 's probably too much to hope that she 'll ever be put in a position of self-defense , unarmed .
You consider this refuting my evidence ? What amazes me is that you all scoff at creationism , yet this is the best most of you can offer to refute scientific evidence which supports the flood . A ) I 'm not a member there . And 2 ) have you ever whistled in the wind ? Why would I waste my time on a forum which specializes in promoting the evo lies and scientific distortions in order to defend their cult religion which seek to erase God from the equation regarding how we came to be ?
It varies . Sometimes elementary/middle school kids and sometimes older minors like high school kids . I not talking about gangbangers if this is where you 're going .
Maybe you could mention some of these plenty people .
It 's technically not killing . Killing means making it dead . For the most animals , the indicator for life is brain activity ( Note : brain activity is one of the requirements of life , but it 's not THE definition ) . When the sperm meets the egg , there is no brain activity . In fact there maybe no brain activity until the end of the first trimester .
Looks like Accipiter does n't trust police with guns . I knew anti-gunners advocated crime ! I guess us little people do n't deserve guns , huh Accipiter ?
To Clive14 : It 's not a theme park . It is a museum similar to the Natural History Museum in London , the only difference being that they take a Biblical stance of our origins rather than an evolutionary view .
[ b ] My bad , but when violent people came after Christ , well we saw what happened , I 'm talking about the violence of how it happened .
If a woman is raped , SHE IS A VICTIM , she is imprisoned with the horrific memory the rest of her life , pregnant or not pregnant . If she is pregnant from the rape , and she kills an innocent human being , by abortion , then is n't their the possiblity that this woman has been victimized again , having to endure MORE pyschological pain that the abortion will cause ? Like a rape , an abortion is n't just a one-time act , THESE ACTIONS , HAVE LIFETIME CONSEQUENCES , and the only one that feels the pain is the Woman , that we all so care about ... pfffft ! ! ! ! If we really cared about women . Rapist would get 50 years to life , no parole . If we cared about women , we would give her equal pay , equal opportunity so she can support a family if she so chooses on her own .
There was a study in Britain back in 1999 that concluded the risk of breast cancer following an abortion was trivial , almost as insignificant as getting lung cancer from a lifetime exposure to second-hand smoke - UNLESS it was the first pregnancy that was interrupted . If the first pregnancy was interrupted , the likelihood of subsequent breast cancer was right up there with the likelihood of lung cancer after a lifetime of smoking . ( The study is obviously not politically correct , so I 've seen no mention of it on this side of the Atlantic . ) The study did n't address causes , and only noted the correlation , but the lead doctor did speculate that it may have something to do with hormonal changes that need to run to completion . Once again , the state of Florida takes the lead in losing and abusing its children .
And if I /worship/ anything , it 'd be reason and thought .
1 ) Show me one instance where science transplanted a group of animals to a new environment and observed them for multiple generations to see if new traits quickly/purposefully/nonrandomly emerged .
The same hypocrisy can be said about the gay marriage movement in that it 's now turning to voting and popular appeal ( legislative solutions ) when it 's always bemoaned majority views deciding anything . These are just examples of conflicting movements using whatever means are available to them .
That is the standard textbook answer , but it does not respond to my post . If you were to ask ronound economists of today like Nobel Prize winner Milton Freedman or Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan ( from the book Capitalism ) they would disagree with this standard textbook answer .
you guys are a riot ... all that nonsense and you can not disprove that life is devolving -- which was the point of the whole post .
We do n't take him seriously anymore because despite having been refuted over and over ( both here and on at least four other boards ) , he still posts the same garbage . Whenever it looks like there has been overwhelming refutation of his thread , he abandons it and starts a new one saying basically the same thing as the one before it . THAT is why he is n't taken seriously , and no , it is not `` unfair '' . I also have to ask why you think he puts so much intelligence into his posts , when all he does is either cut and paste from some anti-evolution site , or say things like `` science is a joke '' My pet dog could do better .

You are absolutely correct ! Ray M .
Personally I will not carry a firearm to a highschool . That is my personal choice . The consequences to me if I screw up with a firearm are too great , at the same time I would not restrict any citizen who wants to do so . If I find the need to be at a highschool , I am hoping that a gunman is going to shoot a lot of kids before he shoots me . That is what happens to the rest of society when you stop people who want to carry firearms . The good people who want to carry , hope that a lot of other people are going to get shot first before it is thier turn . It does not even have to be a gun , it can be any weapon . A criminals weapon vs. a good citizens `` hope '' , criminals win .
And Clerisian , you did n't seem to be arguing that the two were distinct , rather you appeared to say that pro-lifers did support charging mothers who miscarried with manslaughter ( where the mother 's actions , say , drinking heavily , were the cause of death ) .
I am new to 4forums so I dont know how to quote very good yet , but thats not the issue at hand . Again , your example is not an example of the laws of logic because logic is a concept and can not be observed . Putting your hand in the fire has everything to do with nerves not logic ; saying that A then B does not follow because someone could tie your hand ( I know people that will burn themselves ) in a fire and then A would not equal B , however the laws of logic can not be violated .
Do you necessarily care for each and every other person in this world ? Well if you do n't maybe we should justify the free killing of other people as we please . I personally do care about the well being of children and i wish there was more that could be done about certain situations . Unfortunately there are people that make false facts on the availability of such things as adoption . Some of the facts on this issue are available at : http : //www.ncfa-usa.org ( I am including a link to this American site because i think most of you reading this are American ) A common misconception about pro-lifers is that they 're women-hating . This is a misconception put out by feminist groups that support abortion , the truth is there are many female pro-lifers , my pro-life group at the University of Waterloo actually consists mainly of women , sadly this may be due to the fact that women tend to care about others much more than men , affirming my above statement about caring about the children .
I have had some experience with this topic ... My father was murdered when I was 12 , the perp was convicted a year later and was charged with 1st degree murder and sentenced to death.. flash forward 24 years He ran his course of appeals and every legal proceeding you can imagine . His lawyer after 20 years of him being on death row came up with `` retardation '' Mind you he `` walked '' 3 times.. all of which I was there to witness . I was to be a witness to the execution by request of my grandmother who has passed on . anyway at the last minute he got a stay of execution . Back to the drawing table.. Last year after several hearings , they came to the conclusion the he was mentally retarded..scoring a 75 on his IQ test . The limit for the death penalty is 70 . He was a high school graduate , had a family , held jobs.. and clearly competent , nonetheless they found him otherwise . So now he is off death row , and the DA has told me that it is possible he could get parole eventually . With all that it has been a very trying time for me and I have had to struggle with how I really felt about the death penalty . I have been a supporter but never really could my put heart into my conviction . I do not know if it is out of revenge or not , hard to say I am too close to the matter . But I did feel let down when they took him off death row , now I feel like there will never be justice . I put so many years of waiting for that moment ... it sounds kind of sick , but as much as I dreaded witnessing it , I also looked forward to it . I do think that maybe life in prison may be better , only if his experience there is just awful ... . but the revenge side of me , just wants him to suffer what my father suffered . but if you were to ask me to think about this the old fashion way , which would be I should be the one to flip the switch .. not so sure I could do it . so with all that I still do n't really know if I in my heart , support the death penalty or I am just after revenge . The victims of violence I would imagine go through this struggle . Side note ... the man who murdered my father also killed a young girl when he was a minor ... he had escaped from the correctional facility he was in.. and it was several years later when he killed my dad .
ID that submits we were created/designed by things inside the universe that are knowable are rational claims . However , they have no evidence , so they have a long way to go to be shown to be worthwhile to pursue .

Even if her name was Crystal Gail Mangum , right ? Believe it or not , those who commit murder are not above lying about it . Also , what if someone assaulted a man instead , and the man does the same 5 days later ? He 'd be unlikely to get the same sympathy ; but that 's the risk with vigilante justice , i.e . it 's an oxymoron that only works in the movies ... and only to make their producers rich , so they can be safe behind 9-foot security-fences and bodyguards from the very violence they breed against the rest of us .
`` A classic example outside of biology are hurricanes : These are not random air movements at all , but highly organized atmospheric structures that arise spontaneously given the appropriate environmental conditions , '' Pigliucci said . `` There is increasing evidence that living organisms generate some of their complexity during development in an analogous manner .

Now onto the mother dieing if giving birth this is juss my opinion and belief if iwas the mother i would have first married a husband who would raise the kid up right after i died . Also i would know that i have lived some odd years and know its my turn to allow another to live . For i have had a full life and the baby deserves a chance .
No , I 'm saying it 's OK because abortion is legal in this country . I was just pointing out that it 's also legal to execute a convicted killer , and it 's fine and dandy to declare wars where many people will die . `` Thall shalt not kill , unless there is a war '' .
Even if they are women . Time and time again I am disgusted with the callousness in which so-called `` pro-life '' persons seek to ignore the plight of women around the world who have suffered enormous health consequences from pregnancy . It is time for another update on the plight of these women , even if those callous-hearted persons do not care :
I 'd not punish anyone . I do n't think punishment does well at teaching children .

Creation and evolution , between them , exhaust the possible explanations for the origin of living things . Organisms either appeared on the earth fully developed or they did not . If they did not , they must have developed preexisting species by some process of modification . If they did appear in a full developed state , they must have been created by some omnipotent intelligence. ( D.J.Futuyma , Science on Trial ) There are ulitmatly only two explanations for our origins and even noted secular scientists openly admit this . One thing is an obvious fact from history , in western civilization the only choices are creationism and evolution from a single common ancestor .

Second Island ? I 'll have no choice but to parse this for what it is ... it is agreed that mutations can exist , but they only exist laterally , like dogs for instance ... you may have a beagle , that is short and not so hairy that may develop adaptations through breeding that aid it in survival locally ... but what you will not see is a dog that develop wings because it had to fly to the closest food site .
To ask a child to not tease is one thing , to force a child to accept values he is not comfortable with is another .

Does that mean that gays deserve to be teased ?
I can not speak for all pro-choice people , but as for myself , I can say I gladly support a woman 's right to her decisions regarding her own offspring and reproductive health .

Im going back to what you said about our ability to make machines that can read precise wavelengths - I took that as an implication that we can make machines that can see colors that we cant . If a telescope can see a new color , how can we observe the information ? On your link , the star shown is red in color . Could we see it at all if it was a color that the human eye cant see ? Would it appear as red , or gray or brown to us , or would it be invisible ? With our limited number of recognizable colors , is there a possibility that we are coming to false conclusions about the universe ?
Studies of the origin of the first life form , the origin of the earth , and the origin of the universe DO form a large part of intelligent design . Of the several `` different scientific diciplines '' refered to above , they all have one thing in common since there is only one basic alternative to intelligent design , and that 's undirected , random , happenstance processes . For purposes of this debate , can we come up with one general two word phrase for the `` different scientific diciplines '' - a phrase perfectly comparable to intelligent design , which `` theory of evolution '' is clearly not ? How about `` happenstance origins '' ? Since you declare that intelligent design is not science , you have to have a criteria for science that intelligent design does n't fit . Does `` happenstance origins '' fit the same criteria ? If there is no way to test or falsify intelligent design , there is no way to test or falsify happenstance origins . If intelligent design is n't repeatable , happenstance origins are n't repeatable . Other scientists ca n't apply a scientific method to happenstance origins to get the same kind of results as the original scientist , and on and on . Evolutionists imply that with time , they may be able to scientifically get to the bottom of happenstance origins . That 's no more ( or less ) plausible than intelligent design advocates claim to be able to scientifically get to the bottom of intelligent design . If you demand to know how we can prove intelligent design is false or true before we consider it as science , why ca n't the same be asked of you before you consider the progressive steps of happenstance origins to be science ?
... ..but like I said earlier ToE does not admit that the diet or any enviornmental variable can influence traits in offspring . Traits are dictated by genes and genes are closed off from the enviornment . This is the basic dogma of Weismann 's barrier .
Let me rephrase this . Why do people think they have a right to vote upon some one elses life ?
I would hope for fully informed consent ... and counseling on the gravity of the consequences of abortion ... and the outlaw of the killing of humans ... and the conversion of hearts and minds so that the law would n't be needed .

The purpose of this thread is to discuss recent findings on the optimality of the genetic code . Selected articles in the OP include the following : Early Fixation of an Optimal Genetic Code Evolution of the genetic code : partial optimization of a random code for robustness to translation error in a rugged fitness landscape The genetic code is nearly optimal for allowing additional information within protein-coding sequences An extension of the coevolution theory of the origin of the genetic code Can the genetic code be mathematically described ? On the Hypercube Structure of the Genetic Code Topological structure of the triplet genetic code A Neutral Origin for Error Minimization in the Genetic Code . Does codon bias have an evolutionary origin ? A chemical toolkit for proteins & # 8212 ; an expanded genetic code Evolution and multilevel optimization of the genetic code Feel free to add more interesting articles as the discussion continues . Article 1 Thus , to begin , in the first article it was determined by the researchers that : No better codes out of a million biosynthetically restricted codes . This conclusion might be misleading though ( addressed here ) , as the paper states that the tested codes were from a biosynthetically restricted set based on the current hypothesis of the evolution of the genetic code from pre-biotic scenarios . When not viewed from this point of view , other , more optimized codes are possible . The next article ( nr 2 ) shows that : Thus showing in that analysis which include all possible codes ( not only biosynthetically restricted codes ) that the genetic code is partially optimal with regards to error minimization . It should be noted though that analysis only included a subset of the possible optimality feature of the code . From article 3 The analysis above did not include other nearly optimal features of the genetic code including : A ) The actual code is far better than other possible codes in minimizing the number of amino acids incorporated until translation is interrupted after a frameshift error occurred . B ) The code is highly optimal for encoding arbitrary additional information , i.e. , information other than the amino acid sequence in protein-coding sequences . Thus , two more features for which the code is close to being optimal . What is interesting about these two optimal features is that they may facilitate evolution i.e . the code is primed for the future by being optimal in allowing future incorporation of additional information . In article nr.4 The coevolution theory of the origin of the genetic code is discussed . The theory suggests that the genetic code is an imprint of the biosynthetic ( biosynthetically restricted ) relationships between amino acids . A few interesting observations can be made : Firstly , from the article : It should be noted that other exotic amino acids are also used by a few other codes ( derived form the original ) . E.g . Selenocysteine and pyrrolysine are encoded for in many archaea and vertebrates . Archaea , however seem to be the most primitive organisms , thus these encoded amino acids must have been fixated early on . Thus an interesting question can be applied to an `` evolving '' code as posited in the above quote : Are these `` still evolving '' mRNAs , still evolving ? Or did it hit an inevitable global optimum ? Secondly , from the article : Is it correct to assume that in the presence of the precursors of the standard genetic code ( e.g . intermediates of glucose degradation and the citric acid cycle ) , the intimate relationship between these molecules resulted in the inevitable organization of the genetic code ( global optimum of the system ) ? Articles 5-7 These articles discuss fascinating mathematical representation of the genetic code . For example , in article 6 a representation of the genetic code as a six & # 8211 ; dimensional Boolean hypercube is proposed . Abstract : Article 8 : In this article it once again discusses the optimality of the code and a few fascinating conclusions were made . For example : Also form the article : Thus , an important point is raised : The article cautions on blithely using natural selection as an explanation for the features of the genetic code . Article 9 : In this article , the functional integrity and how the architecture of the code relates to it is discussed . From the article : Thus , the properties of the code allow it to maintain its own functional integrity . Also form the article : The maintenance of the integrity of the code is not dependent on selection , but dependent on internal variables ( feedback system ) for maintaining functional integrity . Again , showing another form of optimality . In article 10 : Fascinating research was conducted whereby a sundry of different unnatural amino acids with novel three and four base codons have been selectively incorporated ( engineered ) into proteins yielding viable organisms . An intriguing question arises from this research . It is easy to imagine these to arise through chance and selection ( e.g . amino acids with photoaffinity ) and then be incorporated into the standard code . Yet the code seems to remain stagnant . For billions of year after fixation , little evolution happened in the code . Why ? Did it arrive at a global optimum in a pre-existing fitness landscape , with a pre-existing fitness function ? Finally , Article 11 : The article cites many of the optimal properties above and concludes : Indeed . The genetic code sure is interesting . Whatever the explanation for the origins of the code , whether intentional agency , only RV+NS , self-organization or a combination of these , the fact that these processes converged on a single , reasonably optimal code that is able to facilitate evolution makes it look like it was an inevitable result from the system .

Alexander HamiltonBut if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude , that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people , while there is a large body of citizens , little if at all inferior to them in discipline and use of arms , who stand ready to defend their rights The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed . [ Patrick Henry [ /u ] The great object is that every man be armed . Everyone who is able may have a gun . Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we can not be trusted with arms for our own defense ? Where is the difference between having our arms under our own possession and under our own direction , and having them under the management of Congress ? If our defense be the real object of having those arms , in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety , or equal safety to us , as in our own hands ?
Saul Cornell says he is neither an advocate of the individual rights model nor of the collective rights model . He calls his interpretation of the Second Amendment the Civic Rights Model . According to him , the right to bear arms is like the right to vote . You have the right to vote because you are a citizen of a political community . In contrast , truly individual rights such as freedom of religion and freedom of speech do not depend on citizenship . You have those rights because you are an individual or a human being . People exercise their right to vote in a government organized election just as people exercise their right to bear arms in a government organized militia .

I see that no one has responded to the primary point of the post - that being that as Evolution is a naturalistic science and is , by definition , exclusionary to the supernatural , it can not be used to prove or disprove creation . Equally , as ( young earth ) creation is based on the Bible , and therefore rules out a completely naturalistic means to life as it exists today , it also can not be used to prove or disprove evolution . The two ideas are alternatives to each other , not proofs against one another . Frequently in creation vs evolution discussions I see 'creation is wrong because x , y , z aspects of evolution disprove it ' . Or , 'evolution is wrong because x.y.z aspects of creation disprove it ' . This , however is fallicious . The ideas are merely alternatives . Can we agree that the merit of each theory is separate and must stand on it 's own evidence irrespective of the other theory ?

Another view of this nylon-eating-bug is given ... `` Finally , Mr Cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift . New evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [ e.g . K. Kato , et al. , ? A plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation : Nucleotide sequence analysis of pOAD2 ? , Microbiology ( Reading ) 141 ( 10 ) :2585 ? 2590 , 1995 . ] In fact , more than one species of bacteria have the ability , residing on plasmids . This suggests that the information probably already existed , and was just passed between different types of bacteria . '' `` All that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic ( protein-degrading ) enzyme . This may seem surprising ? How would a loss of information create a new ability ? Answer : enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule ( the substrate ) . Loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function , but would enable it to degrade other substrates , too . Since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages , a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon . If this process were continued , the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required . To put it into perspective , acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions , but they also lack specificity . Indeed , an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme '' http : //www.answersingenesis.org/home ... e7-24-2000.asp Talkorigins gave their usual doubletalk `` Whilst this particular case does not `` prove '' evolution , it is consistent with , and supportive of , the theory of biological evolution . '' Why do they say this ? Because it 's still a bacteria . It 's not like it suddenly became a large multi-cellular organism . But it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations . One site does say that it , the bacteria , had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ? mutations ? , but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus . http : //members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htm One poster on another forum summed the problem up like this ... `` In order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain , which is n't the case with nylon eating bacteria . The bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon , therefore was able to survive in a new environment . Two distinct advantages But , the bacteria lost its ability to survive in its old environment , eat its former diet and suffered a 98 % loss in efficiency . Three disadvantages . So by taking two steps forward and three steps backward , where is the net gain ? If nylon eating bacteria was `` proof '' of evolution , we would still be pond scum , but with the ability to digest whatever happened to become the primary food source .

Dublin , California ( CNN ) -- It 's a Monday morning , and Vince Cefalu just got into work at his more than $ 150,000-a-year-job as a special agent of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives . `` It 's 9:30 . This is what I affectionately refer to as the cage , '' Cefalu , 51 , said . `` I am sitting here with an empty in box and nothing to do . I 'll keep you apprised . '' CNN gave Cefalu a video camera to document what he does at work . For five days , he recorded himself inside his own office . Cefalu said he was put in a job with little or nothing to do because he 's the victim of retaliation by ATF managers . After spending much of his nearly 24-year ATF career going undercover with motorcycle gangs and white supremacist groups , he now oversees equipment inventory . `` I spent my whole life standing up to bullies , '' Cefalu told CNN in an interview to air on AC360 Wednesday night . `` The bullies right now are government bureaucrats who are abusing their oath and abusing the expectations of the public . I 'm not leaving until this is resolved . '' Records show ATF supervisors claim he 's had performance and discipline issues . CNN has interviewed dozens of ATF supervisors , agents and employees around the country who said they 've been demoted or labeled troublemakers just for filing a complaint . Later on the same Monday in which he brought a video camera to work , Cefalu was still having a slow day . `` I 'm going to get something to eat , drag out the day a little bit , get some interaction with somebody ... Here I am , Safeway sandwich , a little news on , catching up on current affairs . I 've had a few phone calls , personal phone calls that I 've made , waiting for something to do . '' At 3 p.m. that day , he records himself , saying `` ... watching a little news , surfing the net , reading some e-mails , doing whatever , waiting for something to do . It 's good money for not a lot of work , I guess . I 'm being facetious , obviously . '' He said ATF managers turned against him after he reported in 2005 what he said was an illegal wiretap plan in a racketeering case . Records show ATF disputes his claims of the planned illegal wiretap . But he said that started a series of retaliatory measures that ended up in 2007 with him in a desk job . His only negative evaluation , he said , was the year after he criticized the planned wiretap . `` Had I not exposed some unethical , potentially criminal clearly outside policy conduct and actions by law enforcement that I was working with , none of this would have happened , '' Cefalu said . `` I would still be working in the field . '' `` I report to where they tell me to report to , and I sit for eight hours a day , and then I go home , '' he said . `` I do nothing . '' Cefalu filed a series of grievances and an age-discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , but an administrative judge ruled against him . His attorney is appealing that decision . And over the past several years , he 's also sent letters to members of Congress complaining about alleged fraud and mismanagement at the ATF . `` It 's almost like being in an abusive relationship , actually . It 's almost like domestic violence , really , '' said Hiram Andrades , a supervisor in ATF 's Washington field office . `` It 's just you think things are going to improve with each director , you think things will get better and improve , but they do n't . '' Andrades , who has a pending discrimination complaint , claims he was discriminated against because he ca n't get promoted . `` I ca n't get a promotion even if my life depended on it . If my life depended on it , I 'd be dead by now , OK ? '' Andrades told CNN . `` This type of retaliation is n't good for the agency , it 's distracting and it 's not good for the American people . We need to make better use of our tax dollars . We need to use it for the mission versus this kind of stuff . This is very distracting and not good for anybody . '' ATF has not had a permanent director since Carl Truscott resigned in 2006 . The agency is being run by Kenneth Melson , who has been deputy director since 2009 . In an interview with CNN , Melson said he was not permitted to discuss employee cases . But he insisted that he does not tolerate any type of retaliation . `` When I first came into ATF -- when I went around and talked to people at headquarters and around the country -- my specific and very emphatic message was that everyone was to be treated with respect and dignity and there would not be retaliation , '' Melson said . `` I will not stand for retaliation against people who are abiding by our orders and reporting violations of law or regulations . '' `` Every allegation of retaliation does n't mean it 's true , '' Melson said . `` Every person you talked to who perceives it 's retaliation does n't mean that it 's retaliation , because there 's been no adjudication of that . They have n't brought it to anybody to try to resolve it . Be careful when you talk to someone about retaliation , because there are many misconceptions and parameters of retaliation -- some of which are misinformed . '' Asked about an employee who does virtually nothing all day , he said : `` Well , I will certainly look into it and find out why he is not doing anything all day . '' He added , `` I will make sure that he puts in a full day 's work , because everybody is going to put in a full day 's work at ATF . '' Since fiscal 2005 , ATF has paid a total of $ 1.6 million to settle discrimination claims , according to federal government records . For the same time period , the FBI paid out $ 1.3 million and the DEA paid $ 331,755 . In addition , records show , ATF has more discrimination complaints filed per employee than the DEA or the FBI . But Melson said complaints have gone down 40 percent since last year . And ATF officials added that the U.S . Marshals Service and Bureau of Prisons have more complaints per employee . John Taylor , a former ATF special agent based in Las Vegas , Nevada , said he was the target of retaliation after he wrote an anonymous letter to the agency 's inspector-general . In his 2006 letter , he alleged taxpayer money was being wasted on agents ' unnecessary trips to Las Vegas . Taylor told CNN he was the target of an investigation into who wrote the letter . `` They asked me did I write the letter . My response was , 'I do n't have to answer ' ... they tried to charge me with lying . '' He said he left ATF as soon as he was eligible to retire after 20 years , on December 31 , 2009 . `` I told my wife , I 'm not going to live if I stay here , '' Taylor told CNN . `` I was depressed . It was hell for me . '' Another agent in the Las Vegas office , who claims he was suspected of writing the anonymous letter , also alleged he was the target of retaliation by managers , according to records obtained by CNN . That agent was fired for failing to pass a firearms test , but later got his job back . ATF agents tell CNN that managers are taught how to handle discrimination complaints at supervisor meetings . CNN obtained a statement from a current ATF supervisor who attended such a meeting in March . During that meeting , ATF associate chief counsel Eleanor Loos gave a presentation to supervisors in the Atlanta field division . According to the statement , Loos stated that `` she considers the EEO process as the employees ' 'bitching platform ' and `` employees use this as a means to complain . '' `` Loos stated in a bragging manner that the EEO process can be dragged on and can take up to three years , '' the statement said . Rafiq Ahmad , the ATF supervisor who wrote the statement , added : `` This is not the first time that I have heard Eleanor Loos making similar remarks . She has presented these same remarks in presentations in New Supervisor 's training . '' Melson told CNN he had not seen the statement . `` But what I can tell you is that the direction that I have given people is to make sure that we abide by the rules of the agency , that we abide by the process of the EEO , and the ombudsman . And that 's why we have the process in place , '' Melson said . In a follow-up interview , Scot Thomasson , chief of ATF public affairs , told CNN that the bureau looked into the statements made by Loos . `` What we found is those statements were being taken out of context , '' Thomasson said . `` In addition , they were being characterized in a slanted matter by the person who wrote it . ''

ur definition of evolution is incorrect .
A right to personal autonomy or self-ownership is a neccessary component of any consistent rule-based moral system in which man can live , since it is impossible to give or get permission to make use of your body prior to using it to get that permission . To put it another way , it is impossible to deny that there is a right to personal autonomy without making autonomous use of your person in denying it . To deny such a right is to deny you have the right to deny it . Systems of rights that do not begin with personal autonomy ; a ) can not be consistent , and b ) to the extent they are put into practice , tend to be tyrannical .

Miracles , such as Jesus ' resurrection , can provide evidence for a religious belief , which hence , provides evidence for God 's existence , following directly from a principle which J. L. Mackie has defended , and requires no assumptions about violations of natural laws . The principle states that a piece of evidence raises the likelihood of a hypothesis whenever that evidence is more likely given the hypothesis . The principle follows from the axioms of probability and is central to common sense reasoning . Footprints in the dirt confirm that someone has been walking there since the footprints are more likely to be there given that someone did walk there . The sound of the siren suggests that there is a fire nearby , for a siren is more likely to be heard when there is a fire nearby . Antony Flew and Mackie both agree that while miracles are extremely improbable , their occurrence is more likely on the assumption that God exists . More specific religious beliefs may rise further the likelihood of a miracle . So it follows from Mackie 's criterion of confirmation that the occurrence of miralces may confirm religious hypotheses . For instance , since the resurrection of Jesus is far more likely on the assumption that He was divine , the resurrection , if we knew it to have occurred , would confirm Jesus ' divinity and thus the truth of the Bible and it 's revelation about God and His existence . Of course , it does not prove it , but it does provide substantial support .
Then there is the argument that flaws in the death penalty lay with the judiciary system , not with the actual penalty itself . While anyone can accept that a perfect judiciary system would only send real murderers to death row , even if this were the case , it does not negate the problems mentioned before .

Intrigued , as always I went to dig a little deeper into the methods used . Generally speaking , one of the best dating methods for an amphibolite metamorphic rock would be to separate out amphiboles for Ar-Ar dating . Using the argon-argon variant of K-Ar allows many cross checks for excess argon or argon loss that are invisible to standard K-Ar dating . At the very least , a better approach would be to date the rocks using individual minerals . The worst possible method would be to measure the age on an inhomogeneous whole rock sample . In the footnotes , the methods are described as follows : Whole rock samples were analyzed in all casesK-Ar at Activation Laboratories , Ancaster , Ontario , Canada ; Rb-Sr , Sm-Nd and Pb-Pb at the PRISE Laboratory , Research School of Earth Sciences , Australian National University , Canberra , Australia . ... . In short , this is a classic example of geochronology done poorly . Snelling either deliberately chose the worst rocks and the worst methods in order to guarantee strange results or was grossly incompetent . Well , ok maybe both . I also notice that the data are not given in the creation article . If someone has a more detailed description of the results , it 'd be fun to look at the individual data points more carefully . Lastly , Snelling implicitly suggests that if geochronology is not correct every single time , then it can never be trusted . Wonder if he ever gets on a airplane .

Hello , Let me see , N.O.W . that 80 % Lesbian Lot ( by their own count and definition ) , continue to whine about women not being given 'equal rights ' , all the while , 51 % of the population ( that 's women ) own the MAJORITY of the wealth , represent the greatest number of teachers , have more rights on college campuses than their male counterparts , have more legal rights than men , are given legal custody of children-even when they are drug addicts/drunks/abusers , and are overwhelmingly the recipients of alimony ( regardless of their being no children in the marriage ) . Ah yes , the 'poor victims ' of all that male power . Women start professional careers later than men , yet demand the same amount of pay that their male counterparts , get , having spent years in the corporate trenches to achieve their status and pay grades . Women continue to whine about how they are victimized by men in the USA , despite the facts to the contrary .

Yes indeed , poor 'oppressed ' American women . Whiners the lot of them ; never happy and wanting to make everyone around them just as unhappy . The bottom line is this : there is nothing between a woman 's legs , which is worth putting up with that , which is between her nose and her chin . And you can quote me on that ! Keep up the whining , I 'm sure the Muslim woman being beaten to death , clitorectomies being performed with rusted razor blades , and noses being cut off , wo n't bother you a bit ; you 've got a man in the office whom you wish to undermine , or a corporation you wish to sue , for some slight against your 'womanhood .

How could you prove it ?
This thread follows on from a discussion elsewhere , in which I said I would consolidate the issues I have with EAM as it has been described to me . I 'd like to preface my comments with a bit of personal context . I 'm often accused of being a 'darwinist ' , the implication being that I am emotionally shackled to a particular philosophical perspective . This is not the case . Accusations of being a 'materialist ' similarly have no teeth in this discussion , for the very simple reason that if a Vital force exists and can influence the physical world then it too belongs to the natural and material , rather than the supernatural . Materialism would simply expand to accommodate it , as it has with other forces .

How does your government feel about that ?
If the justification for morality is obedience to a divine authority , it has no place in a public school . Those without religious beliefs are not by definition immoral .
but they do support the choice to abort a fetus or embryo . An argument made for slavery was that `` you do n't have to own them but do n't tell us what to do '' ..a fairly similar argument but does n't show whether or not abortion is wrong just that some lines of thinking should be questioned .

And , as you may have noticed , we 've been very successful at interpreting the data . We 've learned to do a lot of things as a result . One of the most important reasons scientists accept the theory is that it works .

I support legalization of every drug . I 'm sure most of you are young and have been fed XXXX like `` Marijuana will kill you . '' Actually it does less damage to the brain then alcohol and it can not kill you . It is impossible . It takes 20,000 joints in one sitting to overdose on marijuana . Alcohol however kills thousands of americans each year from alcohol poisoning . You know that XXXXX pothead . He did n't get dumb from pot , he got dumb from birth . Marijuana does not have long term effects on IQ . The only side effect is the lazy side effect . The day after a person tends to be more lazy however it is like a hang over ... .. it only lasts for a day . There is no reason why it should remain illegal . I also support all drugs being legalized because the drug war has failed . We spend billions each year on the drug war and I can call someone right now and pick up some crack . It is a failure . What we should do is make it government controlled and then spend the money to fight drugs on drug education . Flood the schools with ACTUAL info about how herion kills and how it breaks a person down . Tell the kids how you can die from one use of coke . Tell them the short term and long term effects of each drug . If we can educate our kids and even adults through an ad campaign about what drugs do to you then we could save far more people . Also allowing drugs to be regulated will lower the prices and effectively kill drug dealers and gangs off the streets . There are so many benefits to legalizing drugs . Anyone want to fight it ? I have proof to back up what I say and also have the effects of each drug .

Thanks ! There 's a petrified forest in Mississippi also . I do n't know how long it took to produce the petrification and expose the pieces , but I 'll find out next trip . I 'm curious how the YECs could use this in an argument since the process described could hardly occur in nature . Are they going to argue that all the petrified woods could have been formed within the 6000 year life of the earth ? Likely , the use of argon was simply to preclude the presence of oxygen . Other inert gases could have done the same .
Nope . Yowm could be day ( a in opposed to night - thus only around 12 hours or so ) , it could be a 24 hour day , it could be days ( as in a lifetime ) , it could be just a general term for `` time '' or a `` period '' . It could also mean year . Yowm can be translated as each and every one of those . So your statement is false that it is `` understood '' to be that when it could just as easily be translated as one of the others .

Lawmaker in Utah suggests that Martin Luther King should share his holiday with John Browning , Utah gunmaker . Salt Lake NAACP President Jeanetta Williams said she was furious about the idea . It is not acceptable for the name John M. Browning to jointly share the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday ,  she said . Dr . King was assassinated by a man using a gun . John M. Browning was a gun manufacturer . To me its a very mean-spirited act. King would probably be outraged as well , having said that by allowing guns to be purchased at will and fired at whim we have created an atmosphere in which violence and hatred have become popular pastimes. Think Progress Home Page

How does the law define gun ? What if I could throw bullets from my hand at 500 MPH ? Would my arm count as a gun or could I just continue to go around with something more dangerous than most guns ? Just wondering .
I think I remember seeing some post concerning that . It think it went to the affect of the buy back paid only a fraction of what the weapon was worth . But anyways I hope it never does happen here . A voluntary buy back is fine but a forced one should n't be considered . I do n't believe the government will make it a policy to increase gun controls to the level where it is forcing people to get rid of guns . I think they realize the 2nd amendment is strongly against this and they would get called on it .
Am I missing something , or does the linked article have nothing to do with what you said ?
No one has EVER said you ca n't have your `` traditional marriage '' within your chosen religion . That is your right .

This is a far different issue than that of rights for African Americans . In the fight for rights of black people , African Americans themselves were the subject of the controversy . It was an issue directly about people . But the subject of the gay marriage issue is marriage itself : should it remain traditional or not ? Gay people would probably have much more success in lobbying for benefits in the form of civil unions .

However , Blyth saw natural selection as an anti-evolutionary mechanism . If one assumes that the normal type of the species is adapted to its environment , then any departure from that type will be less fit and will be selected against . Thus with Blyth , natural selection is a homeostatic mechanism to prevent change . Blyth was not the only one to use this argument .

Like , I said , I ca n't take men 's position on abortion seriously b/c they can spout off all they want ; however their viewpoint must be affected somewhat by the fact that they will never actually have to make the decision themselves . As far as circumcision ... um ... who cares ? J/k . I really do n't know what to think about that . Never given it alot of thought , as I 've never had a penis , do n't plan on growing one , and therefore I ca n't have a valid point of view . Do whatever feels best to you . Get my drift ?
Up to the courts I suppose . Personally I would feel discriminated against , and `` morality '' is easily linked to religion ( especially in these cases ) .

The question is : Does God exist ? If he/she/it does exist would he/she/it condone the incalculable amount of slaughter that has and still is being perpetrated in the NAME OF RELIGION ? Is it a conscionable god that slaughters millions Jews , gypsies and countless other unwanted undesirables ( including INNOCENT babies and children of these unwanted undesirables ) ... or the unwanted Chinese , Vietnamese , Turks , etc . Etc . Etc . Lets not forget the millions of Catholics , Protestants and Muslim , in fact ; has any race been spared from ending up in the HATE cycle of killing the unwanted that God does not want ? Is God a cold hearted mass murderer just in the morning , or in evening ? What are Gods guidelines for killing off the sinners ? Why does God need to revert to killing at all ? Or does the messenger of God carry out all the murders ? Who benefits from all the killing , God or the messengers ? Could there have been a better God strategy ? How about the all powerful and all seeing God simply visiting each and every sinner in town and command that they stop sinning ... Let me tell you that if God talked to me just once I would never sin again . Why did only a few men in the last ten thousand years talk directly to god ? Why cant everyone talk to God ? It is time to be honest . Question what you have been duped into believing . Who knows , you may find that you can find a God like tranquility and peace within yourself without having to believe that God is running the show .

Storrs Olson , curator of birds at the National Museum of Natural History said : `` The idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at Nature and National Geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith . Truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program , which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age -- -the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion .

I guess that if I wanted to counter that argument I would point out that man was created seperately from the animals , and , as you point out , in God 's image . Thus , the rules that apply to animals need not apply to man . In particular , there 's no cause to assume that man evolves , macro or micro , simply because animals do .
Now you 're claiming that a gun is a precision machine . Before you 've claimed that the guns you classify as `` assault weapons '' are `` inaccurate and designed for be fired from the hip '' . Which is it ? Prove it then . Then you 've got absolutely no justification for supporting gun control , you should be supporting criminal control instead . Then why do you keep supporting laws that would restrict access to guns , rather than making it harder for violent offenders to get out of prison and back on the streets where they pose the greatest danger ? Then what 's your justification for wanting to make it harder for good people to have access to firearms ? Do you fear something in particular ? Or do you just not like how some people choose to exercise their rights and want them curtailed in a way that makes you feel better ?
( ... . ) Darwin clearly understood the threat of directed variability to his cardinal postulate of creativity for natural selection . He explicitly restricted the sources of variation to auxiliary roles as providers of raw material , and granted all power over the direction of evolutionary change to natural selection . He recognized biased tendencies to certain states of variation , particularly reversions toward ancestral features . But he viewed such tendencies as weak and easily overcome by selection . Thus , by the proper criterion of relative power and frequency , selection controls the direction of change : When under nature the conditions of life do change , variations and reversions of character probably do occur ; but natural selection , as will hereafter be explained , will determine how far the new characters thus arising shall be preserved ( p. 15 ) ( Gould 2002 : 145 )

asahi.com ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Unloaded rifle on TV triggers controversy - English OTSU , Shiga Prefecture -- Given this nation 's strict gun control law , were police overreacting when they swooped on a TV broadcaster that had allowed a celebrity to handle a hunting rifle during a live broadcast ? The Shiga prefectural police insist they were perfectly within their rights , but TV networks are outraged , citing the fact the weapon was not loaded . The incident stems from a show aired Jan. 17 by Biwako Broadcasting Co . Almost four months later , police mounted a search of the premises and confiscated a dozen items , including a script and a DVD of the show . Critics accuse the police of being overzealous and question their motives , but law enforcement officials remain unrepentant . Shiga prefectural police regard the incident , in which a hunter with a gun permit allowed TV personality Noburo Harada , 57 , to momentarily handle the rifle during the show , as a serious breach of a law concerning the storage and management of firearms . So much so , in fact , that on June 12 , the prefectural police referred the case to prosecutors . As a result , the hunter , aged 49 , along with a 60-year-old TV producer and a 37-year-old director of the show , could face charges of violating the swords and firearms control law . Police did not pursue a case against Harada even though he briefly handled the weapon . Police argued that he did not actually `` possess '' the rifle because the hunter handed it to him in an unscripted moment during the broadcast . Police justified their search on grounds that they needed to determine if the law concerning the storage and management of firearms had been broken . The show , called `` Tokimeki Shiga 'S , '' is broadcast one Saturday a month . In the show , Harada visits various locations in the prefecture as a travel guide . The program in question was set in Yogo , where Harada and other cast members were served a pot of wild boar meat . The hunter who had killed the boar appeared in the scene . He offered the unloaded weapon to Harada and asked , '' Do you want to hold it ? '' Harada held the rifle and commented , `` It 's heavy , is n't it ? '' adding , `` Not everybody has a chance to hold it , right ? '' He held the firearm for six seconds and then gave it back . Biwako Broadcasting says the scene in which the hunter handed over the rifle was not in the script and was improvised . The TV crew decided to display the rifle on the show after the hunter told the director he had no problem with the idea at a preliminary meeting . The prefectural police began their investigation after a complaint by a viewer . The intervention by the police flabbergasted Harada and employees of other TV stations . `` I never could have imagined anything like this , '' Harada , a former member of the male comedy duo Anonenone , told reporters after he was questioned by police on June 2 . `` I was stunned . '' Akihiko Ito , head of the TV station 's programming department , said the station would cooperate with police , but defended Harada 's actions . `` We consulted our lawyers , and it is hard to believe that touching a rifle for about six seconds is equivalent to possessing it , '' he said . A spokesperson with a TV station based in Osaka sharply criticized police . `` They should have at least asked ( Biwako Broadcasting ) to cooperate voluntarily , '' a spokesperson said . `` From a common sense standpoint , we can not even comprehend what the police were thinking . '' An employee at another TV station was also critical . `` If we , for example , were to produce a program about a knife shop and an actor picked up a large knife , would the police investigate us , too ? '' the employee asked . `` Such an overreaction would be intimidating toward people trying to do their jobs . This would ultimately undermine viewer interest in programming . '' But police say they do n't understand what all the fuss is about . They say the media has , by focusing on the celebrity angle , blurred the facts in the case . A senior official with the Shiga prefectural police said the real issue is not that Harada briefly held the rifle , but whether bringing the rifle to the live broadcast was appropriate in terms of `` storage and management . '' An explanation for the police tactics may lie in the revised gun control law , which took effect in January . The law was tightened after a 37-year-old man in Sasebo , Nagasaki Prefecture , shot and killed two people and wounded six in December 2007 . The man , known for erratic behavior , committed suicide after the shooting . The incident called into question whether existing regulations regarding gun permits and firearm storage were adequate . `` I believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the TV crew lacked an awareness of the firearm 's potential danger , '' another police official said . According to the National Police Agency , police can file a case against anybody if he or she , with criminal intent to kill or injure people , possesses a weapon for even a second . A case can be built based not on the length of time of possession , but on the purpose of possession , the presence of criminal intent and whether the suspect tricked or maneuvered the gun owner . The Shiga prefectural police justify the raid on the grounds that they had to find out how it was possible to bring a gun to the show . By transporting the gun to the show , the hunter may have violated the rules under which he was granted a gun permit , police asserted . They defended questioning Harada and the crew as crucial to ferreting out the real issue -- did those involved in the program improperly store and manage the weapon ? Takaaki Hattori , professor of media law at Rikkyo University in Tokyo , says that police went too far . `` The way the police conducted their investigation is not convincing . I sense they were trying to use the media to sell the public on the revised gun control law , '' he said . `` They should have been more cautious about the exercise of power by public authorities . '' But he also said the broadcaster could have been more prudent . `` The TV station should consider whether it was absolutely necessary to use a gun in making the show . The gun owner may have been primarily responsible , but the broadcaster is also to blame for lacking awareness of the law . '' Takaaki Matsumiya , professor of criminal law at Ritsumeikan University School of Law in Kyoto , disagrees that the TV station or the hunter were in any way culpable and lays the blame on the authorities . Citing a precedent set by the Tokyo High Court in June 1967 , he said : `` The high court decided that the act of touching a handgun for dozens of seconds by a man brokering the sale of a handgun during the transfer did not constitute 'possession , ' '' he said . `` There have been no precedents to alter that interpretation . Harada did not 'possess ' it ( during the show ) . '' Matsumiya also defended the hunter who brought the rifle to the set . `` When the precedent concludes that a person 'has no legitimate reason ' for bearing and carrying a firearm , it assumes that he or she was going to do harm or ran a risk of doing harm , '' he said . `` It is obvious that was not the case under these circumstances . `` ( IHT/Asahi : July 2,2009 ) Now then , what 's all this bull**** about how other industrialized nations are better off with regard to guns when compared to America ? I do n't see such being the case , do you ? If you ca n't even touch a gun that somebody hands you to examine without breaking the law , that is a serious violation of human rights and everything else . How can Japan be so much better off than we are , if it 's a crime for somebody to hand you a rifle to look at but not to keep ; especially when it 's unloaded ! ?
I do n't think that there are any marriage rights for anyone gaurenteed by the constitution . I believe that if marriage is offered to heteros , and they seem to think it is their right to get married , then marriage must be extended equally to gay people . I believe that one group using their religion as a basis to form laws that violate another groups religious freedom , with govenment support , violates the constitution .
I 'm not joing the anti-gay rights movement here , but perhaps they are thinking that people are trying to add a new element to their already established bathrooms . For example , the introduction of glass partitioning instead of the traditional barriers . They try closing their eyes , but they ca n't resist the urge to look and then ... arrrggghhh !

Can you really see that Grizzly ? It would literally cause a revolution in certain States . Obama needs everybody on his side in the forseeable future . There wont be any real attempt for at least a generation I think . Not until the American public accepts a much more left wing government than they would today . As long as there is a lot of opposition I cant see it happening .
It seems to me that allowing anyone to disarm us and having no way to defend ourselves is a whole lot like giving the keys to our homes to a criminal . The government as well as criminals who arent going to give up their guns in the first place would have total control over all of us because we would have no viable means in which to fight back , we would either have to obey , go to prison , or possibly die . I think it is a travesty that so many anti-gun proponents would spit in the faces of men and women who have fought and died to keep us free from such things by not only allowing this to happen , but they actually support it . Our service men and women didnt make those sacrifices just to protect us from foreign tyrants , but from any from within as well . These people need to wake up before it is too late and stop promoting the removal of what may be our most important right of all .
So they ( pro-life peeps ) say abortion is murder . Of course , you can only murder people . So their rule is that fetuses ( feti ? ) are people also . But then they ca n't explain why fetuses are n't listed on the US Census , or why there is n't a funeral every time a woman has a miscarriage . Pretty much , along with the rules of having children , you would have to acquire the birth certificate during conception , you would have to pay taxes for children , even if you 're only pregnant , etc . Or am I missing something ? Care to clarify , anybody who disagrees ?
Actually , one . After the adoptions years ago , we hit the financial slump and had a suprise ... The costs will extremely low .

And as I 've said , there are plenty of organizations that will cover all costs finacially in cases of adoption .

The Bible only refers to `` high hills '' , and the mountains today wre formed only towards the end of , and after , the Flood by collision of the tectonic plates and the associated upthrusting . In support of this , the layers that form the uppermost parts of Mt Everest themselves of fossil-bearing , water-deposited layers . This uplift of the new continental land-masses from under the Flood waters would have meant that , as the mountains rose and the valleys sank ( as Psalm 104 suggests ) , the waters would have rapidly drained off the newly emerging land surfaces . The collapse of natural dams holding back the floodwaters on the land would also have caused catastrophic flooding . Such rapid movement of large volumes of water would have caused extensive erosion and shaped the basic features of today 's Earth surface . As a result of this extensive erosion ( caused by the retreating Flood waters ) it is not hard to envisage the rapid carving of the landscape features that we see on the Earth today , including places such as the Grand Canyon of the U.S.A . The present shape of Uluru , a sandstone monolith in central Australia , is the result of erosion , following the tilting and uplife , of previously horizontal beds of water-laid sand . The feldspar-rich sand that makes up Uluru must have been deposited very quickly and recently . Long-distance transport of the sand would have caused the grains to be rounded and sorted , but we do n't see this at Uluru , i.e . they are jagged and unsorted . Which indicates rapid transportation ( like through a cataclystic Flood ) . If they had sat accumulating slowly in a lake bed drying in the sun over eons of years , which is the story told in the geological display at the park centre , the feldspar would have weathered into clay . Likewise , if Uluru had sat in hte once-humid area of central Australia for millions of years , it would have weathered to clay . But besides the `` fact '' that it has reportedly been exposed to weathering for hundreds of millions of years , the feldspars are still very fresh , as though they were exposed only yesterday . Similarly , the nearby Kata Tjuta are composed of an unsorted mixture of large boulders , sand and mud , indicating that the material must have been transported and deposited very rapidly . Receding floodwaters eroded the land , creating river valleys . This explains why rivers are often so much smaller than the valleys they flow in today - they did not carve the valleys . The water flow that carved out the river valleys must have been far greater than the volume of water we see flowing in the rivers today . This is consistent with voluminous Flood waters draining off the emerging land surfaces at the cose of Noah 's Flood , and flowing into the rapidly sinking , newly prepared , deep ocean basins .

here is something for all you dumb atheists One day a 6 year old girl was sitting in a classroom . The teacher was going to explain evolution to the children . The teacher asked a little boy : Tommy do you see the tree outside ? TOMMY : Yes . TEACHER : Tommy , do you see the grass outside ? TOMMY : Yes . TEACHER : Go outside and look up and see if you can see the sky . TOMMY : Okay . ( He returned a few minutes later ) Yes , I saw the sky . TEACHER : Did you see God ? TOMMY : No . TEACHER : That is my point . We can not see God because he is not there . He does not exist . A little girl spoke up and wanted to ask the boy some questions . The teacher agreed and the little girl asked the boy : Tommy , do you see the tree outside ? TOMMY : Yes . LITTLE GIRL : Tommy do you see the grass outside ? TOMMY : Yessssss ( getting tired of the questions by this time ) . LITTLE GIRL : Did you see the sky ? TOMMY : Yessssss LITTLE GIRL : Tommy , do you see the teacher ? TOMMY : Yes LITTLE GIRL : Do you see her brain ? TOMMY : No LITTLE GIRL : Then according to what we were taught today in school , she must not have one !

Tom Mangan , a senior ATF special agent in Arizona , compared the flow to reverse osmosis . `` Just like the drugs that head north , '' firearms move south , he said . `` The cartels are outfitting an army . '' More than 6,700 licensed gun dealers have set up shop within a short drive of the 2,000-mile border , from the Gulf Coast of Texas to San Diego -- which amounts to more than three dealers for every mile of border territory . Law enforcement has come to call the region an `` iron river of guns . '' And while U.S. political leaders and presidential candidates have focused rhetoric , money and time on stemming the northward flow of drugs and illegal immigrants , far less has been said and done about arms flowing south , largely from states with liberal gun laws , into a nation where only police and the military can legally own a firearm . Mexican authorities have been pressing the United States to do more to help a border force they describe as overwhelmed and often intimidated . `` Just guarantee me that arms wo n't enter Mexico , '' Mexico 's public-safety chief , Genaro Garcia Luna , told a radio interviewer recently . Stop the flow of guns from the United States , he said , `` and the gasoline for the crimes that we have will run out . '' U.S. guns arm Mexican drug cartels - Los Angeles Times

If we look at a closed system , as materialists suppose our universe to be , and look strictly at the material , physical events occurring within it , and assume that it is receiving no further 'physical ' inputs than were the 'initial conditions ' of the 'Big Bang ' , then it becomes plausible to believe , as materialist/mechanists most adamantly insist , that every single change event that occurred , is occurring , or ever will occur , was predestined , immutable , and inevitable , no matter whether it was anomalous or was systematic , right down to the last typo I 've made so far in this post . All thanks to what they label as 'inititial conditions ' . In the case of 'the big bang ' they 've another word for that , too , -- something that call a 'singularity ' . One more cute bumper-sticker that has no real meaning behind it at all . Seen from that angle , everything that occurs in any 'system ' is simply a continuation of the action of the 'drivers ' involved in the 'initial conditions ' , no matter how protracted that action may be . The 'initial conditions ' of 'the break ' in a game of billiards determining exactly where each ball will end up , no matter how many ricochets it makes off rails and other balls . And so on for each shot throughout the systematized process that is the game entire . And that is very much the view of the universe 's internal systems as held by materialists today . The closed system that is the universe seen as a variation on a pool shot , i.e. , `` assumed '' , 'taken for granted ' , initial conditions determining various dissipatory extentions in subsequents events , until 'the table ' is all used up , entropically . All 'systems ' , be they physical or biological , as allopoietic strings of predestined and mechanically inevitable entropic outcomes . That mentality is utterly satisfactory until it slams into a brick wall called biology . All of a sudden we have autopoietic systems where phenomena are observed that can not be justified or rationalised in terms of 'initial conditions ' , nor in terms of additional external physical inputs , and allopoietic controls , but only in terms of initial and continuing psychical inputs . This does not stop true-believing materialists from trying to rationalise these psychical biological phenomena back into their mechanical mindset , however . We hear new magic words from them intead . Words like , 'epiphenomena ' and 'emergence ' . More euphemisms for 'spontaneous generation ' , aka , 'creatio ex nihilo , ab nihilo ' . Aka , 'magick ' . Materialism , and the darwinism it spawned , is an extremely superstitious mindset .

Examples of logical absolutes are : something can not be itself and not itself at the same time ( Law of non contradiction ) . A thing is what it is ( Law of identity ) . A statement is either true or false ( Law of excluded middle ) . These are simple , absolute logical absolutes .
In my opinion , we do n't give the American people nearly enough credit to assume they ca n't be trusted with issues like this . Maybe , just maybe , the reason that many American people think gay marriage is wrong is simply because it IS . But I can tell you that I believe strongly enough in the American system that if enough of the public get behind gay marriage and support it to the point where it becomes legal in all the states , I would accept that as what America wants . What I do n't accept is judges ( individuals ) deciding these issues , even going so far as to go against the American people . That is a VERY dangerous precedent that is much more monarchial than anything .
Yes , if you argue with a liar like that , the debate ends up being over their lies , not about the subject .

`` The language approved by Congress explicitly states that law enforcement officials are to be given full access to firearm trace data . ''
http : //www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,157267,00.html Saturday , May 21 , 2005 AUSTIN , Texas  The Texas Senate ( search ) approved a proposed constitutional ban on same-sex marriage with a 21-8 vote Saturday , sending the issue to voters . State law already prohibits same-sex marriages . If approved in a statewide vote in November , Texas ( search ) would join 14 states that statutorily and constitutionally ban same-sex marriage . Massachusetts is the only state that allows such marriages , although Vermont and Connecticut have approved same-sex civil unions . Opponents have criticized the ban as discrimination against gays and lesbians and warn it could harm heterosexual families if domestic partner benefits , powers of attorney and common law marriage are called into question . Sen. Todd Staples , R-Palestine , who sponsored the legislation in the Senate , said none of those scenarios would be affected and would not prevent same-sex couples from adopting children . The House has voted to ban gays from becoming foster parents , but that measure has received little support in the Senate . Staples rejected arguments the amendment would discriminate against gays and lesbians and the estimated 43,000 same-sex couples in Texas . Sen. Rodney Ellis , D-Houston , equated the amendment to Jim Crow-era laws that discriminated against blacks . `` At least they had the good sense to never write their bigotry into the state Constitution , '' said Ellis , who called the amendment `` trash . '' Staples said he is offended by accusations the amendment is anti-gay . `` There 's a distinction between intimate associations and the right to have the government recognize or subsidize your arrangement , '' Staples said .

Since you 're such a brainiac and all , why do n't you visit the UN website and see what your beloved UN is up to ?

Note the bolded : What do you mean unspecified means by an unknown designer ? Where did you come up with that fairy tale ? Since you 're calling it ID creationism , I will too , and must remind you that according to our beliefs God spoke creation into existence and that is pretty specific . And I also agree that ID was reworked to explain creation without referring to God directly , but everyone knows who made everything . It is evolution that in reality openly admits that everything came about accidently/randomly through an unknown , undiscoverable and indiscernible series of mutations that just happened to result in the constant and consistent harmonious regulation of life on Earth . Now that is a fantastic and unbelievable assumption to make , but that an intelligent and thoughtful being spoke creation into existence is much more reasonable .
P.S . For some reason I am unable to reach my other post `` What drive evolution ? '' I am always `` timed out '' and my computer is cut off from the wet site . So I 'll start over here .
You once said that you had done a detailed study of evolution , `` with an open mind . '' You never did tell me at what university . What books and papers written by real scientists did you read - by the way - real scientists do n't have ministries . I suspect that you were n't being truthful when you made that claim .
The latter , of course . I 'm not anti-marriage . In fact I 've been `` institutionalized '' with the same woman for 26 great years so far . I just do n't see the benefits to society for promoting gay marriage . All I see are increased chances for abuse of the law , additional costs and a promotion of a lifestyle that I , personally , believe is deviant . ( not deviant as in `` sinister '' , but in the sense of `` abnormal '' ) But that 's not to say that I 'm closed minded and ca n't be persuaded otherwise . There are other things that I consider deviant , but can tolerate , none-the-less .
so does the Creationist hold that certain absolutes exist regarding Creation , such as a personal God created all that is . We understand science ca n't prove God which is a huge stumbling block for the evolutionist , but is n't one at all for us because we can see the spiritual with evades the scientific perspective at all levels of understanding .
When you say to its credit , and refer to stepwise feedback , the focus on irreducibly complex structures , reasoning , etc . it inspired me to do a quick search on science branches or science lists

This new cosmology is proposed as a creationist alternative to the big bang theory . It passed peer review , by qualifying reviewers , for the 1994 Pittsburgh International Conference on Creationism.2 Young-earth creationists have been cautious about the model,3 which is not surprising with such an apparently radical departure from orthodoxy , but Humphreys has addressed the problems raised.4 Believers in an old universe and the big bang have vigorously opposed the new cosmology and claim to have found flaws in it.5 However , Humphreys has been able to defend his model , as well as develop it further.6 The debate will no doubt continue .

HOW OFTEN do you see people change their minds based on somebody fighting for `` gay rights '' ? I have seen it , but it 's only a handful of times . Out of HUNDREDS of people I 've talked to , it 's only a `` handful of times '' . Suppose Democrats do pick up the gay banner hard and heavy . Full gusto . What 's the effect ? I seriously expect minimal . This is going to be a battle over time . Gays got sodomy laws overturned , and the reaction was anti-gay marriage laws and amendments . The SIMPLEST thing , that should have been the most obvious to everyone , of sodomy laws overturned got a `` anti-gay marriage law/amendment '' reaction . These fights ARE BEING picked and chosen . ROFLMAO ! No . We fundamentally disagree there . How long have you been arguing the gay marriage issue . And you state that you SUPPORT equality on every issue with only the gay marriage hold-out , right ? If YOUR mind ca n't be changed in all that time , why do you think that we could win over the nation just by having Democrats come out hot and heavy . Furthermore , THINK about it . HOW LONG have we been pushing for ENDA ... And we just tried the vote , and it failed ... EVEN ON THE ISSUE THAT HAS OVERWHELMING MAJORITY SUPPORT , the anti-gays are able to stop the win . What do you think will happen on an issue we DO NOT have majority support on ?

Just imagine if firearme safety was as heavily promoted in schools as sex education is . If we were to train children how to handle firearms , I feel confident that we could reduce accidental shootings , which the gun control crowds claim as one of their goals . No more of the `` I thought it was unloaded '' or `` it just went off accidentally . '' Ironically , I believe that federal gun-free school zones coupled with zero-tolerance policies make it nearly impossible for this to happen . Gun control could be costing children 's lives . Or maybe it 's just Darwinism in action .
Even if more guns do help prevent mass shootings it does n't necessarily follow that allowing more law abiding citizens to carry guns around is the solution .

[ url ] The concept that mutations occur by chance is often questioned by non-evolutionists as being a requirement for strict randomness , but just what they mean by this is usually left unstated . In addition evolutioinsts do not in general specify what `` by chance '' or random actually means . Depending on ones world view there may in fact be no events which occur `` by chance '' as every event is viewed as causal . Accepting that ( and its likely that events at the genetic level are indeed causal ) , the question is what `` form '' or randomness are evolutionists really talking about . WW claims that the very fact that mutaions are not strictly acausal ( and in his not so well developed opinion are DIRECTED towards greater fitness by something other than selection - ie a vitalist hypothesis . Its useful to nail this question down tight .

since evolutionism and creationism are both attempting to answer the same question , ( i.e. , how come existence ? ) they are mutally exclusive , and if one is true , it automatically falsifies the other . this means that if evolutionism is accepted as true , then logically creationism , and by extension the entire bible , is false . the notion that the bible is completely and uncompromisingly true is paramount to christianity . with all that in consideration , it should be no surprise that christians will do everything possible to show evolution as false
because of big advances in military technology it 's difficult to see how the kinds of arms typically owned by modern American gun owners would be very effective against the type of arms used by those in the armed forces .
Because if evolution can not explain all changes it is false ,
Nor have we excluded the divine ; we have merely shown that if god exists and is involved he is being consistent .
I simply wanted to make the point that if you believe an unborn has a soul already , then aborting the child simply means it gets to go straight to heaven . That is not really a bad deal for the child .
You need n't be far left to support reasonable gun regulation . What current firearm related issue would drive an `` anti-gunner '' to commit a terrorist act ? Or are you just lumping anyone who supports gun control in with PETA and radical environmental groups ? I 'd be watching for the next murderous domestic terrorist to come from the ranks of those sporting teabags . Wan na place a little wager ?
It is all relative to our perspective Matt , so from the perspective of the Age of Grace , the Age of the Law seemed harsh . But do n't forget that the same God who gave us the Age of the Law , also gave us the Age of Grace which we currently reside in . And you can thank what Jesus did for this Age .
btw , the reason the definition of `` God '' is `` God '' is because that is how the public percieves it ... 90 % of the world believes in `` God '' .
This argument is frightening for two reasons . First , it must reject the notion of parental responsibility in order to succeed . Second , in spite of that weakness , people in high places think it 's compelling . Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , writing in the North Carolina Law Review , has admitted that Roe v. Wade was deeply flawed , and instead quoted the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in support of abortion . Women get pregnant , she argued , men do n't . Abortion gives women a shot at equality . She then cited Thompson for support . The responsibility a mother has toward her child supersedes any claim she has to personal liberty . If it does n't , if Thompson 's and McDonagh 's arguments succeed , then release Susan Smith . Release the deadbeat Florida tourists . If parenthood is an act of heroism , if mothers have no moral obligation to the children they bear , if child-rearing is a burden `` above and beyond the call of duty , '' then no child is safe , in the womb or out .

And I forget ... . you 're Americans . So I am trying to be gentle ... . but , um , comparing humans to OTHER animals and plants is not off topic or irrelevent . It is only when people hold themselves above nature that they start getting into the God myth and sense of superiority . In short . Humans are animals . We are mammals . We are primates . We have opposable thumbs , which have allowed us to adapt a little better than most primates . Like other primates , we kill en masse , engage in incest , rape , viciously cruel physical abuse and cannibalism , among other acts . We are not special as a species , nor unique . Or only true not worthy point is that we are an incredibly egotistical species that , for the most part , likes to take credit for the inventions of a SELECT few of the homo sapiens spectrum ( those that argue- but man has invented this and that ... most people are profoundly dense and that is why there are `` HOT COFFEE- CAREFUL NOT TO SPILL '' labels on < cDonald 's cups ) . Humans ARE animals .

So you deny that this man is a victim ? Realize that the gunshot drew attention , and attention is something criminals do n't want . Maybe without that gunshot , the guy would 've been beaten to death . But I suppose you 'd be happier , because at least the old man was n't a gun owner . Or I suppose you think he should 've let the criminal have the money ; all that is needed for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing .
Let me rephrase , what in the life of Jesus do you have a problem with ? Not a problem in the practices of the church or the people , but in the being that we believe in . Which part do you have a problem with , or do you simply have a problem with the fact that is a `` religion '' .
Here 's my original post again , I challenge you to explain how these alleged stone age sheep herders whom you scoff at and mock described contemporary living creatures which paleontologists today identify as dinosaurs , from skeletal remains ?
Yeah , it was 9-zip on the individual right to kba in Heller . Over 35,000 watchers ... no one thought it would not be incorporated . Part of the transcript with Tom and Erin :
To abort because of an identified significant malformation is perfectly reasonable to me . My wife and I discussed this early in her pregnancy since we we 're told that our chances of a serious genetic abnormality was 1 in 74 . Long odds on a horse but seemed a real possibility at the time . We were in complete agreement to abort in the worst case scenario .
Come on now . That 's a bit simplistic , is n't it ? Drop a hottie between those same college boys and watch the testosterone at work there . Lots of things can make men aggressive .
You have to be logical and realistic in your expectations of what can demonstrated/observed as evolution in action and what can only be described from evidence from the distant past .
But , when the religious `` fund raising '' has been clearly demonstrated on the anti-gay side , one would think that a demonstration of proof would be pertinent before any definitive statement can be made ... Otherwise , your claim of `` just is n't true '' lacks substance ...
How do atheists account for the laws of logic in a universe without God ?
To start a thread . How nice . William Demski , one of the `` founding fathers '' of the Intelligent Design movement , once wrote a review of a book about the Bible Code . Remember that his followers call him the Isaac Newton of Information Theory and he is supposed to be a great mathematician and theologian . It is here and here . There is a blog post about it here . When I first read this review , I rolled on the floor laughing ( on the inside ) , and then I cried a little ( on the inside ) . I cried because so many people fall prey to this charlatan , who does n't really believe what he preaches , but knows he makes buckets of duckets by writing books and giving lectures and keeping people interested in the `` debate '' over evolution . I think the blog post says it all , but I have to put something here . I 'll just post all the lines that made me chuckle . Since skip codes can also work on just about any piece of literature , I suppose that Moby Dick and War and Peace are also time capsules capable of predicting the future . That 's right . It 's either chance or non-human intelligence . No other choices are possible . Brilliant . This one is the best ! Since it must be a non-human intelligence and since the Bible talks about YHWH , the non-human intelligence talking to us through a time capsule must be YHWH . It is most certainly not Satan or the Flying Spaghetti Monster , to wit . This just happens to be one of my favorite ID concepts . The concept of impossible improbabilities . If it is unlikely , then it is impossible . Oh but wait , he covers his tracks a bit later . Oh my , but is n't you 're whole endeavor to say that life has a small p-value , therefore could not have possible arisen by chance . I just happen to dispute the low p-value of life arising . Not only do evolutionists usually not accept a low p-value for life forming , we Pastafarians also do not accept it , since we know that there is 100 % chance of the FSM creating life with His Noodly Appendage . Then he starts equating the Bible Code ( which has been debunked , I mean seriously debunked , start here ) . In my mind , if the Isaac Newton of Information Theory says , `` At the same time that research in the Bible Code has taken off , research in a seemingly unrelated field has taken off as well , namely , biological design . These two fields are in fact closely related ... The relevant statistical methodology is identical for both fields , '' and I say that if one of those methodologies has been debunked , then so has the other . I think William Demski and other founding fathers of ID creationism are the movement 's worst enemies . They contradict themselves repeatedly and usually their words can easily be used against them to refute or debunk ID itself , and I do n't mean by quote mining or any other creationist tactic . On one hand there is Michael Behe , who under oath claimed that in order for ID to fit a definition of science , that definition also had to be broad enough to include astrology , and on the other hand there is William Demski , who claims that ID and the Bible Code follow the same statistical methodology and are very closely related . To me , it looks like these guys should be telling fortunes , not lobbying school boards . Well , I do suppose they are mostly sticking to selling books and lecturing for $ 200 an hour , so you 've got to give them credit for keeping up the sham for so long . I 'd really love it if someone got on this board and tried to defend the Bible Code or William Demksi 's apparent endorsement of it .
Give me a break ! ! `` lack of modesty '' ? Oh come on now . Like every other European country , Portugal is not void of nude beaches , child sexual abuse scandals { http : //www.propagandamatrix.com/121003portugalchildsex.html } , condom vending machines in public areas { http : //www.portcult.com/Portugal.15.SEX_SEXUAL_HABITS.htm } , porn , and registered prostitution . So , do n't even try to tell us how prudent Portugal is , because that 's just bull .

What is the proposed progression in macroevolution ? Is it something like unicellular life to multi-cellular life , random multi-cellular conglomerations to an amoeba , to a fish , to a dinosaur , to a mammal , to an ape , and finally to a man ?
Most women do not feel this way about their abortions -- unless they have been programmed to do so .

The way I see it- if government can regulate free speech to protect people againt things like obscenity and libel
The problem with this is that the public school systems do not want to acknowledge that there even is a God .
or that they just do n't want the child . This is not a sufficient argument . If you do n't want to have the child , protect yourself , or *practice abstinance* .
Object to the woman being required to remain pregnant when she does not want to be .
To expound on my last post : And yet this is taken to be fact unanimously in our history books . Funny how easy this book gets a pass . If we think it 's Homer then for this book , that 's good enough . But not so with the Bible . There can be absolutely no kernel of uncertainty , which in ancient texts , ambiguity is unavoidable . In regards to who wrote these books , the best evidence we have leads to Homer . Therefore , we decide it is almost certainly Homer who is the author . This is undisputed . However , in regards to the Bible , skeptics overturn the use of Occam 's Razor and require more than adequate proof of the Bible 's claims . Even though the Bible is the most heavily documented writing of its day , still skeptics require more in order to believe the Gospels are actually true . Double standard much ?
Yep , the Bushies want to bankrupt the country .
Seems like you criticize him for allowing the government to `` give '' something , then criticize because it 's not enough .
... I feel that though the overwhelming number of objections brought up by Clive14 and the later objections by DE , I did not represent the Intelligent Design position as well as I could have , had I spent more time and thought on the debate . Therefore , I am offering in this thread a complete rebuttal of the objections to irreducible complexity that has been brought forth by DamEtel . If DamEtel wishes to do a formal debate on the subject , I am willing . So , here goes & # 8230 ;
Here 's an excerpt from the transcript of Joe Horn 's 911 call : JOE HORN , TEXAS RESIDENT : They just stole something . Im going after them , Im sorry . 911 OPERATOR : Dont go outside . JOE HORN , TEXAS RESIDENT : I aint letting them get away with this s -- t. They stole something . They got a bag of something . 911 OPERATOR : Mr. Horn , do not go outside the house . JOE HORN , TEXAS RESIDENT : I 'm sorry . This ai n't right , buddy . 911 OPERATOR : You 're going to get yourself shot if you go outside that house with a gun . I do n't care what you think . HORN : You want to make a bet ? I 'm going to kill them . 911 OPERATOR : OK ? Stay in the house . HORN : They 're getting away . Joe Horn took his shotgun , went out to confront the burglars as they were leaving his neighbor 's house , and shot both to death . In an interesting twist , weeks after the shooting , the Pasadena police department revealed that , unbeknownst to Joe Horn . `` a plainclothes Pasadena detective witnessed the Nov. 14 shootings after he pulled up in an unmarked car seconds before Horn fired three shots from his 12-gauge shotgun . Corbett said the plainclothes detective , whose name has not been released , had parked in front of Horn 's house in response to the 911 call . He saw the men between Horn 's house and his neighbor 's before they crossed into Horn 's front yard . According to the Chronicle : `` Corbett believes neither Horn nor the men knew a police officer was present . 'It was over within seconds . The detective never had time to say anything before the shots were fired , ' Corbett said . 'At first , the officer was assessing the situation . Then he was worried Horn might mistake him for the `wheel man ' ( get-away driver ) . He ducked at one point . ' `` And Horn didnt go to jail thanks to those right to kill laws or castle laws that the NRA supports !

Rubbish , there are many that argue otherwise . The life of twins can be viewed as starting at the moment the zygote/ embryo splits for example . The reality though is there is no single point at which a human life begins : the moment the egg and sperm form , the moment of conception , first division and implantation , the moment the heart starts to beat , the moment of birth etc all mark stages in the formation of a new life .
VERY well written . In the spirit of debate , possibly too well written . You have to learn to temper your article , leave the anti-gunners some room to argue , the we can make them look stupid . If you just lay out your case , back it up with historical precedent , provide links to articles written by knowledgable and noted scholars , and answer the most frequently used ( and stupid ) rebuttal ( what about nukes ) , then you leave the GG 's very little room to spout off and look foolish . shame on you .

The whole `` change the definition of marriage '' is mainly a scare tactic used by anti-gay religious bigots . They do n't seem to realize that words can have several meanings .
I 'm serious . I want a legitimate debate once and for all on this issue ... . You can use scripture or what not but keep it clean and non demeaning if you can ... BUT you must also have other reasoning BESIDES scripture for your argument ... . So here is the challenge . Why is homosexuality wrong and how does it affect the Constitution or the well being of other American Citizens ? In other words how does a gay person being gay affect the daily lives of Joe Schmo in a NEGATIVE manner ... . And what would the detriment to the every day citizen be if homosexuals were given equal rights in employment , marriage , and other basic rights that heterosexuals now have ...
Why do we sometimes feel guilty or ashamed when we have done something wrong ?
As will become clear in the following , I maintain that these amino acid-pre-tRNAs came directly from the biosynthetic pathways of the first six amino acids evolving along the biosynthetic pathways of energetic metabolism and that they were the first amino acids to be codified on these still evolving mRNAs .
I also got a kick out of you saying this : I prefer to use more `` neutral '' sources , but I 'll take a look for myself and verify everything I can . Yet , you neither offered verified links to support the one you posted , nor did your original link respond directly to SOCs issue by showing that countries which legalize gay marriage do n't result in higher homosexual activity .
But of course , the real issue is whether or not changing marriage is a civil right to begin with , because these ballot initiatives are generally about whether marriage should be protected from being redefined .

The Bible reports there was a time in the history of humans that lifespans were incredibly long . According to Genesis people lived to over 900 years old .
I keep hearing the statement let the people decide or let the people vote . Why should people be allowed to vote on my marriage ? No where else and in no other civil rights aspect do we see this type of statement .
Why sure , I 'll simply report the facts and let you decide , unlike msnbc !
Science has now quantitated that a genetic mutation of as little as 1 billionth ( 0.0000001 % ) of an animal 's genome is completely fatal.The genetic difference between human and his nearest relative , the chimpanzee , is at least 1.6 % Calculated out that is a gap of at least 48 million nucleotide differences that must be bridged by random changes . And a random change of only 3 nucleotides is fatal to an animal . Evolution ca n't work , and is not scientific .

In conjunction , and continuing from the above post I present this . It seems that not only do evolutionists put forward examples of artificial selection as evidence of natural selection , they also present purpose as randomness . A good example is the Typing Monkeys scearnio `` Attempts have been made to support evolution by appealing to mathematics to justify long ages . For example , Nobel prize winner , George Wald , wrote , `` Time is the hero of the plot . Given enough time anything can happen - the impossible becomes probable , the improbable becomes certain . '' ( 1 ) Thomas Huxley ( `` Darwin 's Bulldog '' ) used this technique in Oxford , in 1860 , while debating Samuel Wilberforce . He stated that if monkeys randomly strummed typewriter keys for a long enough time , then sooner or later Psalm 23 would be printed out . Huxley used this argument to demonstrate that life could have originated on Earth by chance . ( 2 )

bestiality commiters will possibly make similar arguments , since their logic is about the same ( i.e. , not illegal , not hurting anyone else ) , and there will be no surprise if people could marry their pets in the future .

I mean scientist know evolution is n't 100 % absolute truth , but no one on this forum is willing to admit there could be other possibilities out there .
It would be more accurate to say that evolution has selected for reproduction and death over immortality and self-repair - if the latter is even possible .
If same sex couples are offered equal rights under a PACS ( or some other legally recognized union ) as married couples , why does it matter which `` door '' they come in through ?

Archie is NOT right - he has an opinion , as we all do . Pro-lifers seem to want the definition of human with attendant rights to begin at conception . The blastocyst is now turning into a tumour . So the pro-lifers can now alter their views on what constitutes 'human ' as and when it suits their purpose . Forget the emotive view of what an embryo/foetus looks like : some think that as long as it has appendages and looks human , then it IS . It is n't . It 's still a parasitic organism dependant on the host mother . You ca n't deny that . Contraception v. abortion is a separate issue : in the meantime , the host mother should be the final arbiter of what happens to her body .

Mr. Jack I contend that religion is based on faith . Since it is impossible to know whether there is no God , atheism is also based on faith .
** The `` methodology '' of science is not materialism/mechanism/darwinism , but simply empiricism leading inductively/abductively to hypotheses regarding regularities in causation in nature that can be tested via the predictive experimentation of the scientific method . Neither empiricism or the epistemological process of the scientific method are the exclusive property of materialism/mechanism , nor did they originate from within that metaphysic , despite the beliefs of materialist/mechanists to that effect . Unfortunately , some 150 years ago , that methodology was set aside , and has remained out of sight , with regard to the hypothesis that is generally referred to as 'darwinism ' .
It 's been upgraded from theory to a law a long time before you were born , as far as I 'm aware . It 's has n't been a theory for a long time . Things are a theory until enough scientists reproduce the same results repeatedly . Then it becomes a law
Monkeys show sense of justice Absolutely amazing . And Capuchins , although bright relative to most other mammals , are n't as bright as chimps .
But this fact of degeneration is quite lethal to evolutionists . Not only does it make their wild ideas for the origin/evolution of life improbable  it makes them IMPOSSIBLE .
Except for the fact that guns were around long before Browning was ever born . Browning did n't invent the gun , he just made some of the finest models ever to exist .
It 's ridiculous , but evolutionists make such assumptions every day that deal with nothing more than shallow presumptions that are n't evidence of anything at all .
I do agree that channeling male aggression into non-lethal pursuits is worthwhile . I do n't see a place for firearms in that effort .
The key question is , really , whether guns make violent events more lethal .
If you have two large male deer butting heads against each other , you might think ... the strongest will win , and pass on his genes . However , sometimes the deer 's horns inter-lock and if they ca n't separate they die . So , a cowardly weak deer that stood by on the side-lines would be able to mate . Survival of the cowardly and weak comes into play .
Or that strange pull to make a bad decision .
Probably bought with our taxpayer dollars and that is why 'jimma Carter ' got awarded one too ?
Now you 're being ridiculous .
Logic can not come from experience because people 's experiences change and are different which means that the laws of logic could change . Logic does not come from your mother 's teaching because not everyone has a mother and mothers think differently . Again , if the laws of logic are human constructs then how can they be absolute since humans think differently and often contradictorily . If they are produced from human minds , and human minds are mutually contradictory , then how can the constructs be absolute ? Therefore , the laws of logic are not human constructs .

So all of you people who are opposed to imposing your moral belief on someone answer this for me ... What would have happened if Abraham Lincoln wouldnt have pushed his moral belief that slavery was wrong and that he wanted to get rid of it ? In a similar and more important issue , we are debating abortion.. Is it moral that 48 million babies ' blood is on all of our hands and some of us dont even feel a conviction about it ? ? Personally , i think its neccessary for the agenda of ending abortion to be pushed just like Abe Lincoln pushed his agenda to end slavery..
the term evolution itself has `` evolved '' so much that its hard for many people to pin an accurate definition to it .
Joe , this is no surprise ... .This Pope is a very conservative one and like it or not the Roman Catholic church and most churches believe the sexual act that gays commit a sin as they would any other sin ... ... ...

Well , considering that quote comes from somebody whose throat I would just as soon slit as have come within ten feet of my child , it means nothing .
Since then it has become the holy grail of the scientific community in explaining how Time and Space began .
Among the 15 states with the highest homicide rates , 10 have restrictive or very restrictive gun laws . 20 percent of U.S. homicides occur in four cities with just 6 percent of the population - New York , Chicago , Detroit and Washington , D.C. - and each has a virtual prohibition on private handguns . New York has one of the most restrictive gun laws in the nation - and 20 percent of the armed robberies . Even more troublesome is the fact that the places where gun control laws are toughest tend to be the places where the most crime is committed with illegal weapons:22

TQ doesnt , and of course hell tell you that I dont .
The feeling I get is that it does n't matter a wet slap what anyone says or does , you 'll interpret it according to the requirements of your pet conspiracy theory . So when people say evolution is n't atheistic , you see it as proof that it is atheistic and evolutionists are liars . When umpteen independent scientific disciplines all corroborate the tentative predictions of evolutionary theory , it 's proof that evolution has pervaded all of science and that all scientists are liars . When scientists say that I.D . is religiously motivated pseudoscience and produce documentary evidence to that effect , it 's proof that I.D . is really good science and scientists want to suppress it because they 're scared .
To me abortion is murder .
It sounds to me that this `` new '' enzymatic activity came from non-coding dna switching on a gene to produce it . That is what one would expect to find .
It is the `` per capita '' that is important . We are not going to be saving any money on a cash flow basis . In theory we are going to be treating more people for the same money . Essentially the goal is a gain in efficiency . The problem I am seeing is that so far I have not seen anything in the bill that really touches on waste in our health care system . I have used this example before . A while back I injured my ankle . I went to the doctor to get it checked even though I was fairly certain it was just sprained . He agreed that it was probably just sprained , but sent me down for an MRI just to be sure . Why a $ 3000 MRI instead of a $ 70 X-ray ? I do n't know , and when I asked him , he did not really seem to know . The MRI gives better detail , but in checking for broken bones that is not really a consideration . He said that was just the protocol they use now . If we want o0ur health care system to work for everybody at a reasonable price , inefficiencies like that need to stop . The price of prescription drugs needs to be brought down and the American people need to be educated enough to understand that the `` need money for research '' excuse that the drug companies use to explain away their 2000 % markups is BS ... .over 80 % of medical research for new prescription drugs in this country is ALREADY funded by taxpayer dollars through NIH grants . Using the cost of that research ... which we already paid for ... to justify a 2000 % markup is insane . We need to remove medical exemptions from anti-racketeering and price fixing laws . We need to overhaul our horribly outdated patent system when it comes to drug formulations and medical devices . The new bill does not do any of that ... .at least not the parts I have seen . The new bill basically focuses on getting more people insured and putting more money in the insurance companies pockets . While we may see a slight efficiency gain from increased preventative care , I dont think the savings will be enough to come anywhere close to `` fixing '' the system .
It would be nice if you pick a horse and ride it .
Chicago followed a similar course . In the decade after it outlawed handguns , murders jumped by 41 percent , compared with an 18 percent rise in the entire United States .
I think the problem is , some people believe that gun control , any gun control , is one step closer to the total surrender of all guns . My belief on this is that every time someone calls for repeal of gun control laws or opposes the new gun control laws , it fuels the anti-gun extremists to call for the total ban on all guns . If we can not make and enforce common sense gun control laws that both sides can agree on , neither side will ever stop . If a buy back was ever proposed in America , very few guns would be sold . If guns were banned all together , only the law abiding people will give up their guns , and anyone who does not will unfortunately become a criminal .
Yeah , he 's absolutely correct . So what 's your point ? You think you deserve special rights ? Are you better than straight people ? Are you superior people because your preferred form of sex does n't allow for pro-creation as God commanded humanity to do ? Is this your argument ?
or b . ) they can start a dialog and have consideration as to the reasons why the country is so concerned about this issue .
You claim that there was a god that created the earth in 6 literal days with a miracle , flooded the earth with a miracle and scattered the people of earth and created new languages with a miracle . Now why do modern obervations of the physical world have to support these miracles ? If god made a copy of adam as he was 8 days after creation and placed him in a modern day hospital is n't it plausible doctors would state he was an adult man . So if you could say a human that is a few days old is a mature adult , Could n't you also a universe that is a thousands of years old is billions of years old . Just looking at the muscle tissue in adams arm when it was an hour old you would conclude it had grown over a period of many years . How can you rule out the possibility that this is a good analogy for humanities current observations of the universe and conclude that it had grown over millions of years when it was actually only 1000s of years old .
It does seem obvious that a woman ought to be allowed to protect herself from an attacker and use lethal force to do so , if necessary . If this is true , then we must concede the legitimacy of abortion , which , McDonagh claims , is parallel in a relevant way .
of those add new body parts except for this one ... . evolution of multicellularity in a unicellular green alga ( Boraas 1983 ; Boraas et al . 1998 ) ; ... which is n't even a result of mutation . Got anything else ?
Because Christianity has already proven to be a lie and completely absurd , all of the legislated morality on it is invalid . Do you , ChristAscended , see a problem with relying on a unproven assertion for your debate ? Where you relied on assuming falsely that evolution has been disproved , my example relies on Christanity already being proven to be false as well . Neither your or my underlying assumption is true . Therefore , you can not create a meaningful or even valid discussion based on something that is merely conjecture , especially when it comes to ethics .
If a God exists , then God is as God is .
Feel free samiinh . After all , chemist asked me the same question just yesterday pertaining to the same subject . And the same question about being angry at an allegedly non existent God applies to you too .
Porky Pine put that link in there not out of laziness but out of intelligence . This argument has already been attacked and in the minds of every intelligent person it has been thwarted . Just because you ca n't wrap your mind around such big words and scary numbers does n't mean it has n't been answered .
How do you know there is n't a tiger in the bathroom ? You feel very strongly and have over-whelming evidence that there is no tiger in your bathroom ? ( You live in an urban area , there are no zoos , you do n't hear scratching or biting or the maiming of your poodle , and the water is going )
Having troubles getting past step one Simone ? You just got ta try harder to want a God in your life . I know that it 's more useless than tits on a man but hon , you got ta open your mind and heart up to the uber-natural farces that permiate the other semi-non-existing planes of being . And if yer still having troubles wanting to believe , you can send me some money . It seems to help people want to believe if they 've paid good , hard earned money for it . Something about not wanting to see your investment go to waste ... or was it not wanting to be proven to be a fool who fell for a scam ... But , psychologically putting money on it seems to help you believe .
In the 1960s the base of the Cambrian was determined to be 570 million years old , and this date appears on age compilations even in the late 1980s . Recently , however , there have been significant improvements in radiometric dating techniques . The Precambrian/Cambrian boundary is now dated at 543 million years old . The Middle Cambrian is dated at about 510 million years ago , whereas the oldest trilobites are no more than 522 million years old , which suggests that the bulk of Cambrian time was pre-trilobite .

And in any case , saying 'it has n't happened yet ' is hardly logical proof .
Nobody is advocating that everyone be gay - only that there is fairness and equality for those who are . ( And no saying they can marry someone they ca n't love or are attracted to is not fair or equal . ) And it 's rather interesting that you compare those who seek equality with an oppresor like the Nazi party . Just who is trying to hurt who in the gay marriage issue ? ? ? ? You also seem to know very little about the history of anti-semitism in Germany . You can keep your `` family values '' away from me and my family . We do n't include hate in our moral compass .
It was the fact that there was such controversy surrounding it that it was looked into in the first place .
To support creation you must first tackle the concept of something `` outside '' the knowable universe . Because this is irrational , the entire concept of creation is irrational to `` believe '' in . You can believe in it , but you must accept that the belief is not a rational belief .
U.N. vs . Guns : An international gun-control fight . By John R. Lott Jr . The U.S. government often makes American gun owners feel besieged . For example , over the last decade it is simply impossible to find one study by either the U.S. Justice Department or the Treasury that measures the benefits from people owning guns . While this has been done by both Democratic and Republican administrations , the Clinton administration surely set new standards for misleading attacks on gun ownership with its studies and public-service ads .
People have claimed that owning a gun makes you more likely to be shot . Well , there is the risk of suicide , but I 'm talking sane people here . So how would owning a firearm make the owner more likely to be shot ? How would it make him more likely to be killed ?
I tend to prefer `` fair-weather '' pregnancies myself ! Seriously though , you ca n't separate those two issues . A woman 's `` right '' to choose does n't need to be argued in a vacuum , apart from the moral and societal implications . And I would argue that the real root issue IS the moral one . The original post was asking about wether pro-chiocers feel that ANY pregnanices should continue . The answer is of course we do . Demonizing us dose not make you look better just bitter . Wow , I think this is the first time I 've ever heard anyone claim that the pro-choice movement is for the sake of the child . Sorry , you are n't even close . I do n't know a pro-choicer period that would say it 's for anything other than the sake of the woman .
No it means that the genome operates in a more complex way than was previously believed . It does not mean that `` life is irreducibly complex '' since that term is not even sufficiently well defined to test the assertion . And given the scattering of information into many pieces I would say that more and more it looks like `` pieces that happen to be fitted together '' . More and more like a complex kludge . Exactly what one might expect to find in an evolved system rather than a designed or deliberate or intentional one !
Creationists believe in microevolution but not macroevolution. These terms , which focus on small v. large changes , distract from the key issue of information . That is , particles-to-people evolution requires changes that increase genetic information , but all we observe is sorting and loss of information . We have yet to see even a micro increase in information , although such changes should be frequent if evolution were true . Conversely , we do observe quite macro changes that involve no new information , e.g . when a control gene is switched on or off .
in the same way God can not create a round square .
Well this is what i am saying . The probability of a and b in one organism i very low . And the probability of A and B in many generations is lower than just A .
The only thing I think is settled is the Judgment of God that Sotomayor and her spiritually-stunted , unbiblical , like-minded cohorts will be coming under if they do n't repent of the innocent blood they helped shed .
Well , there you go . The fact he , in his reverse analogy , portrays mere disagreement in many cases as telling `` posters there how disgusting and sinful they are and how their rights should be denied '' only makes my point . No once do I recall seeing anyone here saying that he or anyone else was `` disgusting , '' and `` sinful . '' Apparently he 's not too familiar with the concept of ad hominem either .

I agree that women deserve better choices and such , but banning abortion eliminates their usually best choice . Women do deserve better , but how can you say that while advocating an abortion ban ?
Poor child , is your only response to evidence you ca n't refute always going to be to start new baiting and complaining threads like this one , so you can attack creationists from a different direction without responding to the evidence that you ca n't answer ?
You do n't like it that I disagree with you ,
Did anyone else expect anything less ? These evil fundie christianists can have affairs , 2 , 3 , 4 , or even 5 marriages yet gay people are a threat to marriage by wanting to get married .
What happens , is that if you show a new body part evolving , such as the cecal valve in certain lizards , they just push the goal posts back a bit : `` No , I meant a new body part that is so complex that it could n't possibly evolve quickly enough for someone to observe it happening . And no one has ever observed that to happen , so evolution is false . '' Oh .

Butwhat of the fetus/babies that were wanted by daddy but not by mummy what does termination stop then ?
yeah that last sentence was lame but can you argue against my point ?
`` It appears that no rational purpose exists for limiting marriage in this state to opposite-sex partners , '' Kramer wrote . The judge wrote that the state 's historical definition of marriage , by itself , can not justify the denial of equal protection for gays and lesbians .
Oh sure , you can try to present an unrealistic thread here and try to talk about the issue of homosexuality completely divorced from the moral question -- it makes sense that an internet forum would work for something like that .
My point exactly . Carbon dating is by no means accurate , there it does not refute creationism .
That is true but that is the procedure ... ... ... Do you deny it ?
You missed the media coverage of it being signed into law ?
That website is pretty much bogus . A fetus does not even have lungs in the sense we know them until it takes its first breath of air . I do n't know about the 50 % stat ... the earliest it can possibly survive is about the 24 week mark , so that sounds overblown . The eyelids are fused at the 18 week point and do n't open until 28 weeks There is little evidence that a fetus can `` feel '' pain . Regular wakefulness and sleep patterns , as well as continuous brain waves appear around 28 weeks , which is an indication of conciousness . Conciousness would be a requirement to experience pain . Since 24 weeks is the start of the 3rd trimester , and 80-90 % of abortions occur before this point ( I 've hear 96 % as well ) , pain really is n't a problem for abortions . The fetus has never achieved conciousness , let alone has known anything .
And when one does ?
Okay , and you , of course , are n't going to be lazy . So , seeing how you started this thread , would you please explain to us what your point is ?
His being so vocal about it is probably the dumbest thing he could do .
So you speak out intelligently and knowingly with you best evidence yet ... '' Creationists of any ilk fail to understand the power of the environment in acting on genetic diversity over time . ''
Sometimes the law is an XXX , and juries are dumber than you might expect . In general terms , the law should encourage people finding a firearm to call the police . It 's generally not a good idea to be walking the streets taking them to the police . What should have happened in this case ( assuming all is as it seems ) was that the case should have been dropped as a prosecution was not in the public interest , and similarly the jury should have told them where to stick it , as they have in other cases where the law as written has produced an unjust result ( as it happens the law itself is not usually at fault , just that the particular situation has not been envisaged ) . I just hope a pardon is issued for the unfortunate victim of this .
Afterwards , due to a diet of breads , deserts , cooked foods , sweets and toxicity , humans have been degenerating ever since . There is no way to stop this . Our species is dying . Information is weaking .genomes are decaying . If it were not for the internal mechanisms we have in our bodies for controlling the frequency of mutations , extinction of the human race would come quickly .
Is that all you 've got ?
How is allowing both their lives valuing the fetus over the women ?
Both are matters of faith . To believe that there is no logic in seeing the evidence that way is saying Darwin , Crick and Gould were not logical . They choose to believe in evolution but they all saw the overwhelming evidence for design .
This process also differs in that physiological change stems from a self-directing , internal cause arising from within the organism .
And I do n't know about anyone else , but I highly doubt that God would be so asinine as to misspell the word `` describes . ''
On the other hand , I am not suprised that Marc lives such a short distance away from where it is being built .
That distinction may be irrelevant since they do say that no god that any religious person believes in exists . And that is what I was getting at originaly . Still I think that the idea that the existence of all religious gods can be ultimately refuted based on the logic you bring up is invalid .
Nor do I care for the inference that I am an irresponsible parent because I do n't keep my kid in Disneyland . I did n't leave the condoms laying around , they were put away , he found them digging through stuff he should n't have been . Feel free to lie to your kids . I wo n't . Plus he is smart , he would not have been satisified with a vague answer or lie and would have found the information elsewhere and most likely from a source I would not consider as realiable as me . We have got to stop treating sex like a dirty little secret .
I dont care . The point is a gun took his life !
I think this might be the wrong thread for this discussion . Something like this belongs in the crime debate area , where I 'm currently handing Jo his head over and over again .
WW , while that link is encouraging , do you think biology is actually headed that direction or are we deluding ourselves that there will ever be a change in the status quo ? To me , Big Science and Big Medicine are run much like a totalitarian-style government . They mobilize all their people and all their assets in support of their official ideological goals .
Lurch , i wouldnt bother , it will be like banging your head against a brick wall .
If minorities ' civil rights are truly being taken away and hurt due to ballot initiatives , then that is a far better reason to change the system than the fact there are people out there who misuse the system .
And its happening quickly ! Ever notice how many people are on Depression drugs nowdays ? You think this is an accident ? We know that the environement ( ie..what one eats , the air one breathes ) can turn genes on or off .and we know our diets are getting worse and our air and water is getting more polluted . We also know through epigenetics that diseases run in families and are inherited . Thus , there is no other way to go than down .
Heh , well we 'll see how long they can do it .
your probably referring to the mexican basin crater . mass extinction does n't prove evolution . the flood as described in the Bible is an example of mass extinction . besides , in order for the asteroid theory to work , the asteroid would have to create an almost global tidal wave that would effectively kill the animals by drowning . also similiar to the effects of the flood .
What 's your point ? Unicorns breathe toxic gas and have low density , so they can get around all they want .
Reason can deal with anything that can be known ,
I certainly would be totally unconcerned about my survival .
it ca n't always be cared by anyone . What if no one wants the baby or you ca n't get to a place where you can give the baby up ( maybe snowed in for a week ) . Can you kill the baby then because it is now dependent on you .
Anyone who preaches against my people are not a nice guys .
No church has to marry any couple if they do not wish to do so .
If anything , the special dependant class already exists in the form of the heterosexual married couple , funded by the rest of society , married or not . Any `` loopholes '' that exist are now only to the exclusive benefit of heterosexual married couples .
No . It steps firmly in the realm of REALITY Jyoshu . Have you never heard people talk about how police in an area respond in X amount of time for one situation , but for a different situation , like in a neighborhood predominantly black or gay or ___ , the response time is four times as long ? Have you never heard of how there have been cases where people have died because they tried to get medical help at the `` white '' hospital ? Or how about you read about THIS case and tell me that these concerns are n't real ...
Utter nonsense !
So , Clive , everyone that believes that God created the earth is an XXXXX ?
What we are dealing with is a physiological analogy to the GPS system with a coupled autopilot that coordinates air traffic or tankers on open sea , '' says Soren T. Christensen , describing his recent research findings on the primary cilium , the GPS-like cell structure , at the American Society for Cell Biology ( ASCB ) 48th Annual Meeting , Dec. 13-17 , 2008 in San Francisco . Christensen and his colleagues at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and the Albert Einstein School of Medicine in the Bronx studied the primary cilia in lab cultures of mice fibroblasts , the cells that along with related connective tissues sculpt the bulk of the mammalian body .
but at least we are making obvious inroads in swaying the nation in a direction that considers abortion a bad choice .
1d . A union between two persons having the customary but usually not the legal force of marriage : a same-sex marriage .
This is how abstract concept can `` exist '' in our minds , without having an existence of their own .
Assuming the article is correct , these findings certainly constitute a revision to a broad part of genetics , but principally they are just going to give more scope for evolutionary change to cross-overs / translocations / recombination .
If a woman is n't allowed access to the morning after pill , is n't allowed to have an abortion , and is forced to have a child , that will completely change her life . If a woman takes the morning after pill , later she may decide to have a family .
This has already been said , but I add my curiosity to the mix ... What law are you referring to ?
Lately , its been tough for us atheists . From recent scientific discoveries that show the amazing complexities of the simplest forms of life , the subsequent mathematical improbability of random , chance , godless processes producing and maintaining life , to people like Behe , Dembski , Spetner , and many websites untainted with liberalism and political correctness of the mainstream media , the movie Expelled that showed a very real probability of how weve been so close to violating the U.S. Constitution in academia . Well I have news for Christians/conservatives  theyre the ones who are deluded ! [ insert stream of vulgar name calling here ] Because God does not exist  random chance made the universe with all its order and complexity ! How do I know this ? From Madelyn Murray OHair ! She said so , she proved how smart she was when she won her separation of church and state lawsuit in 1963 ! She has garnered so many followers that also happened to have an interest in science , that theyve managed to take over the scientific community ! How could they be wrong ? How could their current representatives , Dawkins and Harris , be wrong ? They obviously know all things ! Now , who should we believe , the Bible , written and preserved over the entire period of the human ability to write , no matter how many attempts have been made to destroy it , or Dawkins and Harris and their millions of followers in the scientific community ? It doesnt matter what the Bible says , Tiktaalik Roseaea is real ! A small band of atheist explorers said so ! We can look in telescopes and see all the galaxies we want ! We know it took that light hundreds of billions of years to reach us ! No God would have made the universe , and sat around that long waiting for us to be able to see it ! Heh heh , is science unbelievable or what ? Now , if you think we dont know how big those galaxies are , how many stars they contain , how many planets they contain that have life on them , how long it takes their light to get here ( accurate to only a few hundred light years , plus or minus ) , you must be deluded or something ! Just ask us , well tell you ! According to Christians , orderly , specified complexity in life and the universe show a mathematical improbability very close to impossibility of random , purposeless origins and existence of reality . Thats ridiculous  all you have to do is note that someone wins the lottery just about every week despite that individuals almost impossible chances - that tells you that evolution HAD to have happened ! Dawkins and Harris clearly say that God does not exist , though some deluded non-atheist scientists say that chance cant fully explain evolution , let alone the origins of life . Dawkins has dreams that spacemen came long ago and sowed the seeds of life on earth then flew away , never to be seen again ! How could he be wrong  he knows all things ! Its amazing how the Bible can give us such obviously sound advise concerning finances , morality , behavior , as well as such accurate predictions about the breakdown of those things , and be so wrong about everything that science tells us about politics , and liberalism [ Obama/Ried ] visual here ] and be so wrong about the age of the earth , or how long it takes light to reach us ! Im sure well find out life originated from lifeless matter someday , its been just around the corner for 150 years now . Never mind that the corner keeps getting further and further away scientifically , were going to find it really soon ! Look , Im an atheist , and us atheists , we understand that things like miracles that defy the laws of physics ( the origin of life by natural processes ) are the truth . We know there is no God , we will never question that , because we are 100 % certain that Madelyn Murray OHair was right ! Christians arent certain about anything  they dont know how God originated , or where he is ! They have no clue about all those galaxies like we do ! Clearly , stuff like morals and finances , and written history have no place in our lives in the 21st century , we must live by the words of Dawkins and Harris  soon they will be able to cure ALL diseases , make us all live forever , and count more galaxies for us ! So that when there is no more death or sorrow thanks to science , and people like Dawkins , Harris , and Obama are ruling over every aspect of our lives , theyll inform me that theyre correct , and they 'll have ways of seeing to it that I agree with them . Are Christians ever that logical ? So Christians , who exactly is the deluded one here ?
Atheists do , but it doesn & # 8217 ; t necessarily mean that they represent science . You haven & # 8217 ; t gotten in over your head & # 8211 ; most who post here don & # 8217 ; t know much about science . TQ doesn & # 8217 ; t , and of course he & # 8217 ; ll tell you that I don & # 8217 ; t. There & # 8217 ; s a big difference between science , and the creation/ evolution controversy . Many atheists who seem to be interested in science are actually only interested in it to the point that it helps them feel & # 8220 ; intellectually fulfilled & # 8221 ; , to discredit religion . Some of the best reading on the creation/evolution controversy isn & # 8217 ; t written by scientists , but by philosophers who have done just enough scientific homework on the subject to keep a clear focus on the controversy , without confusing it with too much detail . Michael Ruse and Bradley Monten are two excellent atheist authors on the subject . Religious authors , practically too many to name . William Dembski , David Berlinski , Phillip Johnson , Cornelius Hunter , many others . You would do well to read anything by any of these people . Far too many young people seem to make the mistake of getting most all of their information from rabid atheists who are also degreed biologists , like Richard Dawkins . He & # 8217 ; s become a celebrity , and most degreed biologists who are not rabid atheists are a little to timid to take him on in a very direct way , without fear of discrimination , academic or otherwise . Michael Behe is one of the few who has been somewhat successful at it , not in avoiding discrimination , but in his ability to make a comfortable living in spite of it . Read & # 8220 ; The Edge of Evolution & # 8221 ; , or & # 8220 ; Darwin & # 8217 ; s Black Box & # 8221 ; sometime .

[ the revolt ] ended when the poorly-armed and supplied resistance was crushed by the German troops ... Approximately 13,000 Jewish residents were killed during the uprising ( some 6,000 among them were burnt alive or died from smoke inhalation ) . Of the remaining 50,000 inhabitants , most were captured and shipped to concentration and extermination camps , in particular to Treblinka . ... According to the Stroop 's report , his forces suffered 16 killed in action and 86 wounded ( these figures included over 60 members of Waffen-SS , and did not include the Jewish collaborators ) . The real number of German losses , however , may be well higher if unknown . For the propaganda purposes , official German casualties were claimed to be only few wounded and none killed , while the Polish underground bulletins claimed that hundreds of Nazis died in the fighting .

It worked just fine for the first half of the 20th century . And training should never be a requirement for exercising a constitutional right .
Thats an easy one . The obvious and correct answer is a resounding no . It has had no effect on the criminal use of guns and no thinking person would have predicted that it would . It would be like reducing the number of scalple salesman in an effort to reduce botched surgeries .
Well lets speculate about how many possible explanations we could concoct if left to supposition . I 'm talking about the only two explanations for the origins of life that have ever been entertained as viable empirically testable concepts in modern science .
For bringing health care to women without the means ? For providing Pap Smears , Mammograms , and birth control for women without the means ? Providiing pre-natal , and post-natal care ? Oh , heck , let the women die of breast cancer and uterine cancer ! Why not ; bash Gays , then you bash the women .
** Apart from the fact that this claim is utterly unsupported empirically , and is so nebulous as to be fundamentally vacuous , what is there in the article that prompts kronus to say such a thing ? Apparently kronus took this as his cue -- `` To investigate whether there was any genetic basis for the effect , the research group examined the expression levels of about 9000 genes in the brain of the chickens . In birds exposed to stress , there was a number of genes where the expression was either increased or decreased , and the same genes were similarly affected in the offspring . '' N.B. -- -The 'genes ' DID NOT change . The 'genes ' in the brain did not mutate . So there goes RMNS darwinism as an explanation for evolved traits in the offspring , right from the jump .
While I am not a huge fan of polls , one of the positions often held by those of us on the pro gun side of the debate is that those in favor of stricter firearms law , are not familiar with firearms or current firearms law .

At least two Metropolitan Police Department units from the nearby District of Columbia were already at the scene when they arrived . Why ? Because police cars attached to the Washington MPDs Civil Disturbance Unit had escorted the SEIU protesters buses to Baers home . Still , the District police did not inform their colleagues of what was about to happen in one of their Maryland neighborhoods . The Maryland officers reported there were approximately 500 protesters on and near the front lawn of Baers house . The primary role of the Washington cops in this event was to protect the protesters .
Well ... that does tend to happen when you waste time arguing the obvious as if it were a rebuttal to anything .
I do not consider same sex marriage or opposite sex marriage good or bad in and of itself .
I 'm not sure what you mean by either genetic determinism or neo-darwinism , .
It is a true transition form , but the argument is whether several different reptile-bird transitionals evolved and which one actually is the ancestor of the birds .

Translation of FS 's question : `` I know it 's wrong , but I do n't actually know enough of the details to present a coherent argument .
Creationism , by the way , is used very broadly . It is simply the study of how we were created , just as evolution is the study of how we `` evolved '' .
Why do people on the pro-gun side continuously try to oversimplify the issue ? No one is really arguing that there would be zero murder without guns . The question is would there be less murders without guns . In developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders . At any rate , I do n't think you can draw such conclusions based on one incident .
*Excepting I wonder why you state just 'physical evidence ' ?

The father failed in assisting the child holding the gun . `` I have a difficult time understanding why gun rights organizations would support and sponsor events where children can fire automatic weapons especially since people in such organizations always try to portray themselves as responsible individuals who do n't endanger others with their guns . I know this post will probably receive a lot of hostile responses from gun activists on this board but it needs to be said and I 'm not going to back down . '' It 's called individual responsibility . The father failed at it and the result was tragic . He completely ignored all the gun safety rules . The gun rights organizations did nothing wrong and neither did the sponsors or even the guy who rented them the MG . It was completely the fault of the person supervising the child ; his father . The fact is all gun rights organizations stress safety first , it 's not their fault some XXXXX failed to follow procedures .
Read these storys of self defence and then tell me Brady how you can justify these The injustice of the British ban on self defense Making matters worse , the British legal system seems to treat crime victims worse than it treats the criminals who attacked them . An example is the Tony Martin case : Tony Martin was a farmer , whose remote farmhouse had been broken in to many times . Martin feared future burglary attempts and the risk of being attacked by a violent burglar . When a pair of burglars broke in while he was home , Martin opened fire with a pump action shotgun . The 16-year-old burglar Fred Barras was killed , and 33-year-old Brendon Fearon was wounded in the leg . Later on that day , the police arrested Tony Martin and charged him with the crimes of murder and wounding with intent . At trial , Martin argued that he had acted in self defense , but the court found that he had fired while they were trying to flee . He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison , although the conviction was later reduced to manslaughter with a 5 year sentence . The surviving criminal , who had over 30 criminal convictions , then sued Tony Martin for the injury he suffered during the burglary . The parole board refused to grant Tony Martin an early release because he has shown no remorse and would continue to pose a danger to any other burglars. Martin was eventually released from prison after spending years in prison and being vilified by the anti-gun groups in the UK for shooting criminals who had broken into his home . Another example , from 2009 , also shows how the British legal system favors criminals over their victims : A millionaire businessman has been jailed for attacking a man who held his family hostage in their own home  while the criminal went free . Munir Hussain , who was threatened at knifepoint and tied up by a gang of masked men in his living room last year , was told he must go to prison for 30 months to preserve civilised society . But Walid Salem , a criminal with more than 50 convictions , was handed a two-year supervision order for his role in the break-in at an earlier hearing . He was one of three men who ambushed Mr Hussain , his wife and children as they returned to their home in High Wycombe , Bucks , on Sept 3 last year after attending Ramadan prayers at their local mosque , Reading Crown Court heard . Their hands were tied behind their backs and they were forced to crawl from room to room before being forced to lie down in the living room . But when Hussains teenage son managed to escape and raise the alarm , he seized his chance and turned on his captors . . . The brothers were found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent by a jury in September . Sentencing , Judge John Reddihough told them it was his public duty to jailing Munir Hussain for 30 months and his brother for 39 months .

Darwinists are the authors of deceit and have pulled a masterful bait-and-switch on society . They have suckered a segment of the population into believing that evolution is true based on the simple fact that organisms have within their genome the ability to adapt to changing environments . For example , the artic fox 's fur can change from a mid-summer brown to a pure winter white in just a matter of months .
You are hot on the trail of the basis of our argument . I believe that there are three stage to the overall theory of evolution :
Woman [ sic ] have already been liberated ( well , definitely in the West ) , have you not noticed ?

You can not begin to hold a rational debate about the unknowable .
Both Presidents were shot in the back of the head , on the Friday before a major holiday , while seated beside their wives , neither of whom were injured . Both were in the presence of another couple , and in each case that man was also wounded by the assassin . After both assassinations there were loud and insistent claims that the fatal shot must have come from a different direction . Each President in his thirties married a socailly prominent twenty-four year old girl who spoke French fluently . While in the White House , each President had a family of three children , and both lost a child through death . Both Lincoln and Kennedy were second children . Both had been boat captains . Both were related to a U.S . Senator , Attorney General , ambassador to Great Britain , and the mayor of Boston . Each had been elected to Congress in the year '47 and were vice-presidential runners-up in the year '56 . Each was elected president in '60 . Before each was elected , a sister died . Both had a friend named Billy Graham and knew an Adlai Stevenson . President Kennedy had a secretary named Mrs. Lincoln and President Lincoln had a secretary named John Kennedy . The names Lincoln and Kennedy each contain seven letters . Both were succeeded by vice-presidents named Johnson : Andrew born in 1808 and Lyndon in 1908 , both of whom had 13 letters in their names and two daughters . Both assassins have fifteen letters in their names . Booth shot Lincoln in a theatre and fled to a warehouse . Oswald shot Kennedy from a warehouse and fled to a theatre . Both assassins were in their turn assassinated by shooters who used a Colt revolver and fired only one , fatal shot .

It seems to me that the non-physical , spiritual entity otherwise known as `` you '' or `` me '' was created somewhere near the moment when our parents ' sperm and egg made a connection ... .both of which are physical entities , but could certainly have a spiritual component to them , thus creating a new spiritual entity .

ias for partial birth abortion i am firmly against it ! to go full term and stab baby in the back of the head after more than three quarters born is not right at all in any shape or form . you have already pushed the baby out passed the shoulders the hardest part in a breech birth . you could easily put one more push and allow some unfertile loving couple waiting years there dream .
Are you suggesting that belief in a devine being , whether real or not , who holds us accountable for our actions is a problem ?
I can appreciate this slant , however I think that a true feminist approach would be to support women who want their pregnancies by finding solutions to the reasons they feel an abortion would be their best choice . If we want to have a child , society should be backing us up on that . Instead , I see such a stigma for single mothers , I see single mothers unable to finish school , I see single mothers unable to work a decent job b/c of either lack of education or lack of child care , I see systems where the men do n't have to support , violence , et cetera .

While your story is a sad one I disagree that you should be happy with having a `` second chance '' . I believe this because you gave your unborn child no chance . I probably should n't say `` you '' because it seems like you did n't have a choice in the matter . Anyway , thank you for sharing your story and welcome to the forums .
But evolutionists are just as religious as Christians : they have their own unseen miracles  ( random mutations ) .their own clergy ( scientists ) their own Bible ( The Origin of Species ) ... .and their own god ( Natural Selection ) .
The possibility that life was created by extraterrestrials currently has 0 evidence to support it .
`` Yes , that is unfortunate because the rapid-field-change hypothesis offers no basis for any of their stuff . Insofar as there is any evidence for the duration of the Steens polarity transition , from estimates of rates of SV , it is several thousand years . The question we examine is whether the systematic streaking of directions of samples as a function of height in a single flow could have been caused by an EPISODE of rapid movement of field direction while that flow was cooling through its blocking temperatures . We state as much in everything we have written , but they ignore that . ''
Which is true , [ see above ] , but which is nothing to be ashamed of , since it applies to anyone , including myself , who feels motivated to debate philosophy .
And let us not forget that its very well documented that mutations in DNA do lead to new chemical structures which are part of the body of microbes . Any contention that new `` parts '' can not be based on genes is doomed to failure on a simple empirical basis . It is without question the case that the bacterial flagella parts are specified by genes AND that changing those genes changes the corresponding parts .

Ah but interracial marriages were only socially prejudiced . There was no real biological basis for the prejudice . We know that interracial diversity is biologically sound . Sometimes there are genetic or congenital anomollies that can be detrimental to the offspring of interracial couples , but these conditions do not preclude the validity of said relationships . You are trying to equate sexuality with racial diversity . This is a false equation , for one , we do know racial traits are inherited and that races can interracially reproduce . This trumps homosexuality 's abilities two fold .
You can have all sorts of discussion about pain etc . You can come up with useful ways of helping people cope . However when you fully understand and aspect of pain in terms of nerve impulses and how your fancy painkiller stops them that is a better result . So restricting yourself to what you can measure can have results and should not be dismissed as `` bad because all restrictions are bad '' .

In Canada anyway , the father must be identified on the medical records ( to the best of the woman 's knowledge anyway ) . I have n't seen the medical records , I do n't know if Bush was indicated as the father or not , but to the best of my knowledge , they have always asked who the father was .

By this same argument I am a prophet . I predict that within a week God will destroy the building in which I am sitting . How will you know that I 'm correct ? It does n't matter !

this statement is n't logical . It does not follow that if the person who creates the laws has to therefore follow them or ca n't change them ... or even that they apply to him . If a teacher says `` no talking in the classroom '' it does n't apply to the teacher now does it .
His opponents were not overlooking `` most likely '' . Instead , they were taking `` most likely '' to the extreme and saying `` this is what it actually is '' . You do the same thing with your dead animal and car vs alien . While you say `` most likely '' , what you really mean is that the alien hypothesis is wrong .

There 's nothing magical in the word `` marriage . '' Just because one is called that does n't mean it 's any more legally superior than a `` marriage substitute '' ( as you call it ) .

This would be a funny thread if the subject matter were n't tragic . The no brainers gun nuts have a modicum of brain though , enough to show them that without guns there can be no shootings . This is the crux of the matter and they know it . So they twist , squirm , insult , bend every possible way trying to avoid facing this uncomfortable truth . But there is no way out and they know it . They love their guns , they are addicted to them like a crack head to coke , they know is a sick devotion that fills their pathetic lives but they can & # 8217 ; t be rid of . Perhaps moving to a sane country such as an European country or Japan or Australia would teach them how the rest of us live unencumbered by paranoia and feeling and being safe without an arsenal strapped to our belts . Come to Australia and leave your guns and ammo behind and you will become free , free from your security blankets . Grow up scared children . I know not all Americans are gun nuts , there some sane persons in America otherwise it would be the Wild West from coast to coast .
People tend to miss the most obvious ( and most dangerous ) way to institute gun control That is to restrict the sale and manufacture of bullets . Without bullets , your gun is nothing but a paper weight . Bullets are also much more difficult to produce than guns . While they can be reloaded , casings are incredibly difficult to make on a small scale . The only way to really do it is to turn them down one at a time on a lathe . Dogs CAN be used to sniff out gunpowder and primers . This is a danger I think people miss when they start bannign certain types of ammunition . Right now , `` cop killer '' ammo is outlawed in the united states . Gun advocates laughed our butts off when they did this , since the `` cop killer '' amunition as they described it does not exist ouside of hollywood ( NO , coating a bullet with teflon will not enable it to pierce body armor , it will lubricate your barrel when you shoot it , though ) . I personally don ; t think this is anything to laugh about . BAnning guns is a stupid and unworkable plan , banning ammo could actually be dangerous .
No Steve , I realise that there are hetersexuals who practice that filthy pastime of anal sex and other sex acts that the human body is not designed to do .

It would be bad enough if it was just the teacher chewing gum and telling the students do n't chew gum . But it does n't stop there . The teacher makes the rule no gum chewing in class . Then later that same day she instructs Billy and Sally to chew gum . Johnny sees this and decides to chew gum too , thinking that its ok. Of course , he gets expelled from school for breaking the rules . In this case the teacher is n't just breaking her own rules , she also commands some of her students to break the rules as well , yet still penalizes those who break the exact rule if they were n't commanded to do so .
3 ) Would you agree that the violinist argument only parallels abortion if we assume that the violinist being connected does not prevent the donor from carrying out normal activities throughout most of that nine months ? In other words , I do not think it a correct picture to paint , as analogous , a donor connected to a violinist who is bed-ridden for nine months , and a pregnant woman who , except in rare circumstances , can engage in normal activity while pregnant .
I think you 're mixing up socialist and fascist . Patriotism is anathema to socialism .
well , i dont know how many abortions there were from 1973-1986 , but im sure those aborted babies wouldve grown up democrats seeing as though their `` parents '' support abortion ( mostly ) . I 'd say more than 10 million ( dont take this as a factual number but id say its around that area ) in that time frame that were aborted and couldve voted in the last election . hmm
Pretty darn obvious just who is doing the obfuscating and denying around here , bud .
No they were trying to not just find a singel gene but overall genetic causality in general . That is why there were so many studies . They have failed to find conclusive proof that sexuality of either type is geneticly derived . This in light of other behaviors is irrelevant . Handedness can also be learned , there is no proof it is geneticly derived or that it is n't but just because it is accepted as genetic does n't validate that assumption or assumptions for any other behaviors . The tendancy to be nervous or rape or commit other crimes may or may not be genetically related . So far they have no proof but would you say that a person genetically predisposed to anxiety is a positive benefit .

What 's the point of posting a bunch of propaganda from some biased website ? Your whole post proves nothing because it does n't show a causal relationship between gun control and mass murder . How come Sadam Hussein was able to kill so many of his subjects although gun ownership was common among the Iraqi public ? I suppose we could find a way to blame all the world 's problems on gun-control . Even this pro-gun website admits that you ca n't blame the holocaust on gun-control . `` The simple conclusion is that there are no lessons about the efficacy of gun control to be learned from the Germany of the first half of this century . It is all too easy to forget the seductive allure that fascism presented to all the West , bogged down in economic and social morass . What must be remembered is that the Nazis were master manipulators of popular emotion and sentiment , and were disdainful of people thinking for themselves . There is the danger to which we should pay great heed . Not fanciful stories about Nazi 's seizing guns . '' http : //www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcnazimyth.html

... Politicians had assumed tighter gun laws would cut off the supply of guns to would-be criminals and that homicide rates would fall as a result , the study said . But more than 90 per cent of firearms used to commit homicide were not registered , their users were not licensed and they had been unaffected by the firearms agreement ...
Samuel Adams If ye love wealth better than liberty , the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom , go home from us in peace . We ask not your counsels or your arms .

And that the said Constitution be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the press , or the rights of conscience ; or to prevent the people of the United States , who are peaceable citizens , from keeping their own arms ; or to raise standing armies , unless necessary for the defense of the United States , or of some one or more of them ; or to prevent the people from petitioning , in a peaceable and orderly manner , the federal legislature , for a redress of grievances ; or to subject the people to unreasonable searches and seizures of their persons , papers or possessions . Cesare Beccaria False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience ; that would take fire from men because it burns , and water because one may drown in it ; that has no remedy for evils except destruction . The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature . They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes . Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity , the most important of the code , will respect the less important and arbitrary ones , which can be violated with ease and impunity , and which , if strictly obeyed , would put an end to personal liberty ... and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer ? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants ; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides , for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man . They ought to be designated as laws not preventive but fearful of crimes , produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts , and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree .

When we got organized as a country and we wrote a fairly radical Constitution with a radical Bill of Rights , giving a radical amount of individual freedom to Americans ... And so a lot of people say there 's too much personal freedom . When personal freedom 's being abused , you have to move to limit it . That 's what we did in the announcement I made last weekend on the public housing projects , about how we 're going to have weapon sweeps and more things like that to try to make people safer in their communities . We ca n't be so fixated on our desire to preserve the rights of ordinary Americans ... Cockrum v. State The right of a citizen to bear arms , in lawful defense of himself or the State , is absolute . He does not derive it from the State government . It is one of the high powers '' delegated directly to the citizen , and `is excepted out of the general powers of government . 'A law can not be passed to infringe upon or impair it , because it is above the law , and independent of the lawmaking power . Rev . Nicholas Collin While the people have property , arms in their hands , and only a spark of noble spirit , the most corrupt Congress must be mad to form any project of tyranny . Tench CoxeThe militia of these free commonwealths , entitled and accustomed to their arms , when compared with any possible army , must be tremendous and irresistible . Who are the militia ? Are they not ourselves ? Is it feared , then , that we shall turn our arms each man against his own bosom . Congress have no power to disarm the militia . Their swords , and every other terrible implement of the soldier , are the birth-right of an American ... the unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments , but , where I trust in God it will ever remain , in the hands of the people . Whereas civil rulers , not having their duty to the people duly before them , may attempt to tyrannize , and as military forces , which must be occasionally raised to defend our country , might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens , the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear their private arms .
Chuz , the purpose of this summary is not to summarise your arguments as a whole - it is to summarise what your argument is up to this point . Why not post just a summary of your position so far , as you see it - I can do the same , then you can continue with your argument ? There 's no point in writing an argument , summarising it and then leaving the thread before I 've had a chance to respond to even your argument ( never mind your summary ) . If you are going to simply ignore any criticisms of your reasoning , then I struggle to see the point of you repeatedly requesting a one-on-one debate in the first place - you essentially regress your argument to the 'because I said so ' that you are ( presumably ) hoping to avoid , it 's just that there 's slightly more detail .

Majority backs gay marriage , ballot measure in poll Lou Chibbaro Jr. | Feb 08 , 2010 | Comments 5 A Washington Post poll published Sunday shows that 56 percent of adult D.C. residents surveyed favor legalizing same-sex marriage in the city compared to 35 percent who said they oppose it , with 9 percent saying they had no opinion . But the same poll also found that 59 percent of residents surveyed favor putting the issue to a public vote in a ballot measure . The poll found that 37 percent oppose bringing the issue to a citywide vote . The poll also identified significant differences on the same-sex marriage issue along racial lines . But the opposition to gay nuptials by blacks doesnt appear to be as strong as local gay marriage opponents have predicted . An overwhelming 83 percent of whites responding to the poll said they favor legalizing same-sex marriage , while 12 percent oppose it . A bare majority of 51 percent of blacks said they oppose legalizing gay marriage in the District ; 37 percent polled said they support it . According to the survey , 4 percent of whites and 12 percent of blacks said they had no opinion on the issue . Although the polls finding that an overall majority of 56 percent support legalized same-sex marriage at this time , LGBT activists familiar with ballot measures on the issue in other states could view the D.C. poll results with caution . In a number of states , including California , voter support for same-sex marriage dropped sharply following well funded and what LGBT activists called highly negative campaigns waged by same-sex marriage opponents . Voter initiatives or referenda seeking to prohibit same-sex marriage have won in every state where theyve been placed on the ballot . In D.C. , a 1978 law barring ballot measures that would result in discrimination against minorities protected by the citys Human Rights Act has so far prevented local opponents of same-sex marriage from putting the issue up for a public vote . The opponents have vowed to continue to challenge city rulings against a marriage ballot measure in court . The Post poll shows that white and black voters differ sharply over whether to bring the gay marriage question to a public vote . Among blacks , 70 percent responding to the poll favor holding a citywide vote on the issue , while 25 percent say a ballot measure should not be held . Six percent had no opinion . Among whites , 58 percent opposed bringing the gay marriage issue to a public vote ; 39 percent favored such a vote . Three percent had no opinion . The Posts poll included responses from 1,135 adults reached by either landline or cell phone during Jan. 24-28 . The paper says the poll has a 3 percent margin of error .
I do n't see the size of the universe as having any implications one way or another , theistically speaking . Omnipotence is what it is : no one thing can be described as harder than any other for an omnipotent being . My position can be summarised thus : I see no evidence for an attentive , involved , anthropomorphic deity that is n't better explained by human ingenuity and/or frailty . I find no compelling reasoning in support of any kind of ultimate creator that does not in turn beg the question of his origin , and again I find the theistic willingness to suspend such rules in the special case of god to be a reflection of our own limitations : we can not imagine ourselves not existing , and therefore falsely believe that we can imagine a personality enduring forever . We ca n't . Whatever it is you 're imagining when you think of god being timeless , must necessarily be wrong . You can no more imagine that than you can imagine the colour of ultra-violet .
I believe there has to be a God because I see no compelling evidence that life spontaneously generated from non living chemicals .

I personally think conservatives undermine their stated adherence to originalism with their moral opposition to abortion influencing their legal thinking with the `` it 's not in the Constitution '' position . This position is in opposition to the maxim that the Bill of Rights is not the exhaustive listing of the citizen 's rights and is a fruition of the Federalist 's fears and warnings about the dangerousness of trying to list rights . Conservative opposition to Roe and abortion rights in general belie their supposed allegiance to the concept of a government with strictly limited powers -- for saying that a unenumerated right does not exist where no power is conferred to act in that arena is stating that no limits on government 's power exist . . . That government power shall fill the void , not liberty . Scalia 's error in Heller was trying to explain the 2nd as a historical entity instead of explaining SCOTUS 's application of the Amendment in prior cases . Heller neither stated or established anything new ; there never was a `` state '' or `` collective '' right aspect to the 2nd . . . It was always interpreted by SCOTUS to be an individual right exercisable , claimable and enforceable by individuals separately from any militia connection . I just wish Scalia had restated and relied on SCOTUS 's prior holdings that the right is not created , granted or otherwise established by the Amendment so the right is not dependent in any manner upon the words of the Amendment . . . Why he engaged in the linguistic analysis I 'll never know or understand . Is there a point here ? Did n't the dissenting Justices all agree that the right is an individual right , claimable and enforceable by individuals ? It is clear the Stevens dissent was focused on a misreading of Miller 's holding and his just for gun rights metamorphosis supporting the illegitimate assumption that the government can exercise vast unspecified and unenumerated powers just because it feels like it . In Heller Stevens abandons his belief in Roe 's `` prenumbra '' theory , that the Bill of Rights is just a rough outline of liberty interests that stand as examples of many others . I endorse Justice Harlan 's dissent in Poe without Stevens ' recent equivocation and find it to be a compelling argument in constitutional interpretation , since elevated to the opinion of the Court in a case which Stevens concurred : `` Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects . See U.S . Const. , Amdt . 9 . As the second Justice Harlan recognized : ' [ T ] he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause can not be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution . This `liberty´ is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property ; the freedom of speech , press , and religion ; the right to keep and bear arms ; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures ; and so on . It is a rational continuum which , broadly speaking , includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints , . . . and which also recognizes , what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must , that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment . ' '' Casey v. Planned Parenthood , 505 U.S. 833 , 848 ( 1992 ) '' Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects . See U.S . Const. , Amdt . 9 .

' '' Casey v. Planned Parenthood , 505 U.S. 833 , 848 ( 1992 ) This famous exposition is a long standing favorite of Stevens . He cited it in his dissent in Albright v. Oliver , 510 U.S. 266 , 306-07 ( 1994 ) . But he abandons his relationship with these ideals in Heller ? Give me a break . . . Who 's sacrificing his principles for policy ? At least Scalia 's error results in an outcome that is consistent with his fundamental beliefs . That can not be said for Stevens .
However , having seen so many of Matthew S 's rants on oppression I was really taking the opportunity to ask if he really knows what oppressionmeans .
So the start of personhood for a particular person is a variable , based on that individuals memory . Twenty years ago I could remember events at my fourth birthday , but today those memories are gone . For a while I had personhood at 4 years of age , but today , looking back , I did not have personhood until I was 6 . As I age and my memory fails , it may turn out that I did not have personhood until I was 21 years old . Personnhood comes and goes . Do I have it right ? Not aware ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Not aware of what ? Shoot a gun behind them and they will flinch . They are aware of loud noises . Throw them wildly into the air and they will cry . They are aware of their own movement . Pinch them , they will cry . They are self aware as they chew on their toes . And of course puppies are aware as well . Unless of course I do not understand what you mean by aware .
Quite often I come across threads discussing abortion where it is quite evident that the only posters are men . After reading these posts I feel like a piece of real estate with a bunch of strangers walking all over my body and stomping on me and loudly debating my worth and what I might be used for . Now it appears that there is a new anti-choice tactic : Women as Environments for the Pweshious Widdo Fetuses It is quite evident that women are not considered by these anti-choicers as part of the human race , as real human persons , as individuals , as citizens , having rights , liberty and the freedom to pursue happiness as is written in our nation 's ( the United States ) foundation documents .
Yes , they are correct . They are also responsible for the various other things like the recent Minnesota bridge collapse , HurricaneKatrina , and many other things . God is punishing his messed-up nation , trying to get us to move from our moral corruption and perversion .

Yes , I noticed and addressed his other observations too . He has some good ones , particularly the emotional ones . Although I may be over looking something , I just do n't see a stigmatism placed on women who give their children up for adoption . Nor of the countless bastard children born out of wedlock , no one really cares anymore . Definatly no more than those who have had an abortion . Good PR spin makes such a mother look noble , giving her child that she ca n't deal with to someone who wants it and will love it as their own .
And as I have stated before , evolutionists are afraid of testing animals . Theyre afraid to test to see if individual animals quickly change phenotypes as a result of an environmental change . ( I challenge anyone to prove me wrong with a link . )
I believe the filibuster issue relates to voting on judgeships only . ICBM , but this wo n't affect abortion issues . It 's only recently that the Democrats have used the filibuster to delay the vote on appointed judges . I do n't think there 's any possibility of getting rid of filibusters all together . BTW , what 's wrong with a pro-life court ?
... if we see relatively few creationists on these boards , all that means is , theres relatively few creationists on these boards . That does n't prove anything . Right ? Lets do some thinking here ...
You never knew what the baby could have been .
First off , it 's not punishment , it 's taking responsibility for your actions . I have addressed the men , this is what I 'm talking about , it was in my last post . Are you really reading the my posts ? I said `` They ( men ) should have to raise the child also as they are equally to blame '' . If I could take some of the birthing pain from women and give it to mwn , I would . The bottom line is that women know that if pregnancy occurs their will be pain , yet some do not protect themselves against it . Why would it then be my responsibility to take that pain into account ? They accepted the risk when the did n't try to protect against it .
Your reasoning would be applicable if only one copy of the gene in question ever existed . If the chance of mutation A happening is one in a billion , and the chance of mutation B happening is also one in a billion , then the chance of them both happening together to a single gene is , as you say , beyond the realms of possibility at 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 . However , we 're not talking about a single gene . A population of a billion bacteria is nothing unusual , and all of them will contain the same gene . So while the odds of any individual experiencing mutation A are very low , the odds of one of them experiencing it are pretty high . The lottery works on the same principle . You probably wo n't win , but someone probably will . Ok , so now we have our billion bacteria , one of which possesses mutation A . However , the odds of mutation B stacking with it are still only 1 in 1,000,000,000 . Now , if mutation A is n't particularly helpful , that 's probably the end of the story . But if mutation A is helpful , then that bacterium will outcompete its peers for resources , and breed more readily than they do - either better in absolute terms , or better in immediate proximity , when in competition for the same resources . Either way , the proportion of the population possessing mutation A will increase until they predominate . Now there is n't just one copy of the A-mutant gene in circulation , there are about a billion , and the odds of mutation B stacking with just one of them are greatly improved . Once again , if mutation B is helpful the descendents of that bacterium will flourish and overrun the population , so that in a relatively short time ( a few hundred bacterial generations ) a single cell possessing neither mutation can give rise to a population of a billion all possessing not one but two billion-to-one mutations - a population ready for the next billion-to-one mutation to occur , and stack , and flourish , and so on . I hope that helps .
Among homosexual men in particular , casual sex , rather than committed relationships , is the rule and not the exception . And even when they do enter into a more committed relationship , it is usually of relatively short duration . For example , a study of homosexual men in the Netherlands ( the first country in the world to legalize `` marriage '' for same-sex couples ) , published in the journal AIDS in 2003 , found that the average length of `` steady partnerships '' was not more than 2 < years ( Maria Xiridou et al. , in AIDS 2003 , 17:1029-1038 ) .
I have a question for all those of you who are against same sex marriage . Now this takes some ability for inward perspective , a quality in short supply here sometimes . Here goes . Would you be happy to accept what you are asking gay people to accept ? Would you want gay people to outlaw your marriages ? Would you still support the majority decision if the majority of people were gay and it was heterosexual marriages that were being denied or banned outright ? Would you accept civil unions even though they were less then marriage ? Would you be happy or find it just that certain religious sects were fighting your civil rights ? I know this is a futile attempt to try and get you all to think of life from a gay perspective .

Your faulty logic is easy to spot : Your only looking at the 26 decided cases listed by the VPC , 2 being slightly more than 92 % of 26 . But , your making the absurd assumption that the VPC listed all the aquitted or dismissed cases . Why would they ? They were compiling a list of CCW murderers . It 's far more likely they were screening out the dismissed and aquitted cases and missed these two . Your 92 % figure is lacking a solid basis and can not be used to predict the outcome of the 49 pending cases .
Well , there is one thing that is n't mentioned here : All species are transitional ! !

This is n't interesting at all . What did these magical `` light-sensitive cells '' evolve from ? What were they before and what event or process caused them to evolve into light sensing cells ?

The doctor argument was brought up here a year ago or so and still is a dumb argument . What happens when you put purposeful doctor deaths vs. purposeful gun deaths ? There is no question that a gun sitting in a box is not really harmful .
Even new Justice Sotomayor , who claimed she ruled by precedent will be bound by the Heller Decision if she remains true to her purported philosophy . The debate between Sui Juris and Res Judicia should no longer be an issue with the liberals on this RIGHT ! It either applies to all or it applies to none which would result as Justice W.O .

BTW , I think the court decision in Nunn vs. State of Georgia did the best summation of this right !
I 'm not sure what you mean . Your quotes from dictionaries certainly give no indication of any blurring . I 'll give you another definition acceptable to biologists.Natural selection is the process by which organisms well adapted to their environment survive to produce offspring while those more poorly adapted may not . In this way , particular combinations of genes are propagated differentially .
While things like this seem like small pro-life victories , they are really considerable and should encourage us pro-lifers that we are making a difference -- getting back to a higher value of the unborn is our goal , and we must not let up .
Orthodox Jews believe that if the mother is pregnant and her life is threatened , she can have an abortion . However , Christian theology is different because we have more books to understand that passage . : - )

I think almost all the members of these populations will breed because breeding in an inherent drive in every population .

In several of my other post I have stated that I do not seek legislation concerning abortion . It is rather my goal to convince people to consider the possibilities of their actions so as not to put themselves in the position of needing to decide on life and death issues . I will join you in an appropriate thread to continue this so as to accomodate Dr. No .

I have done some reading on the marriage penalty and there might be some truth to what your saying although you do get insurance breaks .

They die from bleeding , infection , high blood pressure , prolonged labor and botched abortions  problems that can be treated or prevented with basic obstetrical care .

By the time many women get to the 120-bed hospital here , it is too late to save them .
I agree that this does not settle anything , it merely points out that the unborn do not have all of the same legal recognitions that the born have . I for one , am dead set against allowing the unborn to vote ... and drive .

But if you think that is bad , the Clinton administration pales in comparison to the United Nations ' attitude on gun ownership . This week the U.N. conference to `` Prevent , combat , and eradicate the Illicit Trade in small arms and Light Weapons in All Aspects , '' which concludes today , puts these views in straightforward terms : Governments have the `` right '' to guns for `` self defense and security needs . '' On the other hand , not one acceptable reason for individuals owning guns is mentioned . And to the extent that individuals do buy guns , third-world and western European countries are pushing for a tax on every gun purchase , with the money then being used to eliminate world hunger .

Because this is irrational , the entire concept of creation is irrational to `` believe '' in . You can believe in it , but you must accept that the belief is not a rational belief .

You ca n't hand these issues over to corporations with no real national allegiance .

I still find it ironic that so many people actually construe the 9th amendment to achieve a magical number of rights .
Of the court cases that have been decided over 92 % have resulted in convictions . Statistically , it 's highly unlikely that there will be big deviance from this pattern for the remaining cases .

Why must you people come to threads I 'm on and derail them with ridiculous minutia rather than actually deal with the debate that is being argued ?
Well , the simplest refutation would be to say that God is omnipotent within the realms of logic . Everything that is n't inherently contradictory , God could do . Another simple refutation would be to say that since God is beyond the physical realm , the logic of the physical realm does n't apply to him . Perhaps he can create a rock so heavy he ca n't lift it , and yet still lift it . Our logic may simply not apply , the same way that Euclidean geometry does n't apply in cruved space .

You folks ca n't box with God , your arms ai n't long enough . Many arguments are made about whether creation or evolution should be taught in our schools . I believe in creationism because I have never met an evolutionist who can explain where the very first sign of life came from . Can something not alive give birth to life ? Can something not alive change to be alive ? The answer to both questions is NO ! There are many things I do n't know , but two things I do know are science will never create anything from nothing and science will never create life from nonlife . I still think that it takes more faith to believe in evolution than it does to believe in our creator

Your reasoning of the effects of abortion are correct . The liberals who see abortion as a normal , acceptable , right to choose abortion are aborting themselves into extinction . Reverence , and a love of life is not what motivates Muslims . The power of Islam is . There is nothing to indicate that Muslims `` love '' life . They 'll cut your limbs or head off for nearly any reason . They 'll remove your head with a hacksaw so to take the time for `` you '' the victim to enjoy the moment and to voice your opinion and video it for your family and countrymen to enjoy .

Do I have tell you exactly how many rape/incest victims are the ones who decide an abortion is neccessary ? How many of them need to have counseling years afterwards because they had the abortion , not because they were a rape/incest victim ? There are very few if any girls in the U.S. that would have an abortion after an experience like that . It 's the family and relations that force them into it in order to keep the matter hush-hush . No doubt some of those reasons seem good , but abortion is an incorrect solution . The help a victim should get is a hug , some tears and comforting words so that they view their future life in a positive light . Instead , they bury them in words of `` GET AN ABORTION , YOU 'LL FEEL BETTER LATER '' . Yeah right . Oh , I think I 'll add that only 1 % of abortions performed yearly are for rape/incest cases . And some years it may even drop lower than that . Should we keep abortion legal for just that 1 % ?

As to the rest of your post , well , from your attitude I can tell you are not Christian in the least .
It is rather disrespectful but do n't think it is limited to one side . Most protestors on both sides are n't great . one thing did spark my interest , and it is said often , why is it a `` hard decision '' if you are pro-choice ? Is it hard because you do n't know if you want a baby around or not ? Could n't this decision be just as hard before being pregnant ? Even so , why link it to going to an abortion clinic ? You hear `` It was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place '' but how is going through some protestors making this decision harder ? No one would admit to this but it is statements like `` It was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place '' that make me believe that someone realizes it is wrong and the struggle that makes it hard is whether or not to do the right thing or do they thing that would benefit you the most . And in that case , I agree ... that can be a tough decision .

the amendement reads : A well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed . So it could be either with a literal reading of the amendement .
That should be the basis of all laws if it does no harm then it should be permited .
Why not ? There 's no rules that say faith and science must be separate .
Another alternative is design . This involves abstracting the problem to a simpler form with a smaller problem space . This drastically culls the range of alternatives that need to be considered or tested , enabling a solution to be found more quickly . The success of the process depends upon how well the abstraction - the model - of reality matches reality itself .
Again , instead of dealing with the issues someone raises , you respond with wild , unsupported allegations and personal prejudices , not unbiased facts .

Neither of us are promiscious.You are just making inflamitory remarks . Sodomy ? Homosexuals hardly have a monopoly on any sex act , be it with a penis or a `` foreign object '' ; be it anal or oral . Again , you simply lack any credibility .
Abstinence teaching should be taught more , it may seem obvious to the teacher , but to the student , many of them do n't see it as an option , a lot of students think of everything BUT abstinence . Without affirming abstinence in their minds , the idea is quite unlikely to pass their minds . I 'm not saying all students are going to be sex crazy , but from what I 've seen , the minority of them actually consider abstinence .

Heres what I found on it ; Deleted from Wikipedia - Poe 's law ( deleted 15 May 2008 at 06:32 - Deletionpedia ) It lasted 21 days on Wikipedia before being deleted , and it was originated by a Christianforums poster named Nathan Poe . Doesnt really seem like that big of deal to me , but the atheist community seems to be increasingly fascinated with anything at all that allows them to mock Christianity .
Yer lucky you ai n't as old as me . They would have loved you with the M-1 !
In that case , I 'm wondering why you did n't notice that it provided evidence for an aspect of evolutionary theory ... Basically , it provided evidence that a previous ad-hoc hypothesis was unnecessary to explain the development of hands and feet . I 'd summarize the rest of the article for you , but you ought to understand it already .
Not everyone agrees with policy . Afterall look at the Brady Campaign , one of their long time members was leaking classified information to the NRA and other pro-gun groups on purpose .
Evidence or proof for that delusion ?
So ?
people keep saying thats the law in texas , so Im saying that this is the law in New York , He broke the law so he had it coming , next time dont disrespect the law and get a license , Im just showing how some of the people on this board are major hypocrites , you suddenly get all soft on crime when you dont like the law ,
If you choose to claim that you are pro-life , what are you dong about saving the lives of these women who truly want to have their pregnancies continue . What are you doing about their potential babies which you , by your heartlessness , are not allowing to be born because you do n't want to expend a penny in international aid for prenatal care for women all over the world .

My personal views on the subject of marriage have been shaped by my own experience , tradition and upbringing . But as Governor of New Hampshire , I recognize that I have a responsibility to consider this issue through a broader lens . In the past weeks and months , I have spoken with lawmakers , religious leaders and citizens . My office has received thousands of phone calls , letters and emails . I have studied our current marriage and civil union laws , the laws of other states , the bills recently passed by the legislature and our history and traditions . Two years ago , we passed civil unions legislation here in New Hampshire . That law gave same-sex couples in civil unions the same rights and protections as marriage . And in typical New Hampshire fashion , the people of this state embraced civil unions and agreed we needed to continue our tradition of opposing discrimination . At its core , HB 436 simply changes the term civil union to civil marriage. Given the cultural , historical and religious significance of the word marriage , this is a meaningful change . I have heard , and I understand , the very real feelings of same-sex couples that a separate system is not an equal system . That a civil law that differentiates between their committed relationships and those of heterosexual couples undermines both their dignity and the legitimacy of their families . I have also heard , and I understand , the concerns of our citizens who have equally deep feelings and genuine religious beliefs about marriage . They fear that this legislation would interfere with the ability of religious groups to freely practice their faiths . Throughout history , our societys views of civil rights have constantly evolved and expanded . New Hampshires great tradition has always been to come down on the side of individual liberties and protections . That is what I believe we must do today . But following that tradition means we must act to protect both the liberty of same-sex couples and religious liberty . In their current form , I do not believe these bills accomplish those goals . The Legislature took an important step by clearly differentiating between civil and religious marriage , and protecting religious groups from having to participate in marriage ceremonies that violate their fundamental religious beliefs . But the role of marriage in many faiths extends beyond the actual marriage ceremony . I have examined the laws of other states , including Vermont and Connecticut , which have recently passed same-sex marriage laws . Both go further in protecting religious institutions than the current New Hampshire legislation . This morning , I met with House and Senate leaders , and the sponsors of this legislation , and gave them language that will provide additional protections to religious institutions . This new language will provide the strongest and clearest protections for religious institutions and associations , and for the individuals working with such institutions . It will make clear that they can not be forced to act in ways that violate their deeply held religious principles . If the legislature passes this language , I will sign the same-sex marriage bill into law . If the legislature doesnt pass these provisions , I will veto it . We can and must treat both same-sex couples and people of certain religious traditions with respect and dignity . I believe this proposed language will accomplish both of these goals and I urge the legislature to pass it .
Indeed , for several decades , molecular evolutionists have relied on an evolutionary view that abandons the Darwinian presumption of abundant pre-existing variation , assuming instead that the rate of evolution depends directly on the rate of introduction of new alleles by mutation .

The record already acquired is amazingly good . It provides us with many detailed examples of a great variety of evolutionary phenomena on lower and intermediate levels and rather abundant data that can be used either by controlled extrapolation or on a statistical sampling basis for inferences as to phenomena on all levels up to the highest . Among the examples are many in which , beyond the slightest doubt , a species or a genus has been gradually transformed into another . Such gradual transformation is also fairly well exemplified for subfamilies and occasionally for families , as the groups are commonly ranked ... . In spite of these examples , it remains true , as every paleontologist knows , that most new species , genera , and families appear in the record suddenly and are not led up to by known , gradual , completely continuous transitional sequences .

This is a push to promote lawlessness . The San Francisco fiasco is the prime example . People with certain agendas are refusing to follow the laws . This is a devastating precedent for our Nation .
Claims of `` irreducible complexity '' simply are n't that complex , they typically amount to one of two things : 1 ) Defining `` irreducible complexity '' in two different ways , and jumping between the two definitions to produce an argument that looks like it proves something but is actually a logical fallacy . e.g . I wish to use the term `` rotten bastard '' to mean a man who plays cards . Your husband plays cards , therefore he is a rotten bastard , therefore you should get a divorce . 2 ) Finding obscure creatures or organs that for various reasons have not well been preserved in a fossil record , and declaring that since we do not know *precisely* how they evolved , they must not have evolved . I 'm not sure if you can call this a logical fallacy so much as dishonesty or ignorance of the subtleties of evolutionary processes . e.g . `` I do n't understand how a radio works , therefore it must be powered by magic rainbow unicorns '' . It is a waste of time reading lengthy arguments which amount to the two featured above , so if you could perhaps cut down the 7 pages to the paragraph or two which do not revolve around these arguments , it might make for a more worthwhile debate .

Life comes from Life ( basic science ) yet , evolution breaks that rule
Is there anyone who does n't think species come from earlier species ?
The fact is , we all constantly face the threat of potential harm every minute of every day . Risk is a part of living . I would like to know why guns specifically are needed to mitigate the risk of being the victim of a crime , when other methods ( better locks , alarms , non-lethal weapons like pepper spray and tasers ) can be effective .
And since human evolution is where most of the conflict is , I 'd say this is a pretty important .
i think its finally settled that physical ( testable or tangible ) evidence of God can never be found . this is not only because of its elusive nature to science , but also because of religious requirements . from a scientic perspective , nothing ever occurs outside of the realm of phyical law . that is , physical laws are constant and unbreakable , and there is nothing new or unpredictable or inexplicable about them . because the laws of physics completely govern ever aspect of the universe , there is nothing left for a supernatural being to do , at least where the phsical realm is concerned . there is no supernatural phenomenon , and no occurance that natural physical laws do not affect from a religious perspective , knowledge of God can only come through faith . we already know that faith is certainty in the absence of rational evidence , in other word believing without evidence . Hebrews 11:6 says `` And without faith it is impossible to please him . For whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him . '' faith is the key to religion , and only through faith can religion be established . therefore , if some physical observation could verify God 's existence , then it would contradict what religion says about God . this is a real catch 22. you search for evidence to solidify your faith , but if evidence comes you dont need faith , and without faith you can not relate to God in all , as far as i 'm concrned , it is totally futile to seek rational proof of God 's existence . even if it was found , it wouldnt be found . i remember saying that it is possible to prove that God exists ; that is , in the event that God showed up and said `` hey , it 's Me ! `` . but even this can never happen , because such a scenario would contradict the bible , and thus not prove God exists as far as the bible is concerned . and when all is said and done , it still doesnt answer the question `` does God exist ? ''
We all know the logic makes sense . Slowly increasing global temperatures cause a dramatic decrease in global temperatures ! Just compare the early blizzard that just hit the two Dakotas here in the states with that of the 1920 North Dakota blizzard to see if there is a difference between now and then .
Absolutely amazing . And capuchins , although bright relative to most other mammals , are n't as bright as chimps .
How , despite centuries of artificial breeding and decades of experiments , no one has ever observed one species turn into another ( `` speciation '' )

Murdock also wrote that `` although tradition and societal values are important , they can not be given so much weight that they alone will justify a discriminatory statutory classification . '' Without doing any research I would think that this was the same justification given in freeing the slaves . Because , at the time , many slave owners held that this was the way it had always been and because the Bible says its okay ( the same arguments todays gay marriage opponents use ) . Oh that slippery slope .
Now here is where you 'll have to show some verses and then wait to be laughed out of here . Nowhere in the old testament is there any reliable prophecy that predicts the nature or timing of Jesus .
If the flood never happened ( an assumption ) , then it is much more likely that the dating method would be accurate to ages of tens of thousands of years as many evolutionary scientists state .
We supposedly evolved from simplistic monkeys to what we are today .
Feel free to repeat any prior arguments you 've made , Chuz ; I welcome this thread as the 'start anew ' you suggested elsewhere . While I 'll probably use the ideas I 've rebutted with before , I 'm quite aware I was n't as accurate in my wording of some posts as I could have been ; so no assumptions of my position on any specifics , please , just as I will ( try to ) make no assumptions of yours . In light of that - and given that it is you who is defending your position - I leave it to you to make your own arguments , rather than have me rebut a possibly misrepresented one . Fire away . NB : This is in the Challenger 's Corner on request from Chuz , not me . As such , I can not guarentee a swift reply - one is highly likely , but not guarenteed . Hopefully this wo n't make much of a difference . Pasted from another thread ;
Assuming this right exists ... .you could say that you have no right to kill it though , you can only try to starve it . -You have consented sex and get pregnant . The pregnancy is a direct consequence that was known when having sex . -You have consented to a stranger coming into your house to eat dinner . The stranger coming in and sitting down and using your plates and eating your food is a direct consequences of you inventing him in for dinner . -If you say you do n't want the unborn to `` live off you '' anymore then the only thing you can do is starve it because you ca n't kill it as it did nothing that it was not allowed to do until just now . -You have decided the stranger must go , however , you do n't have a right to kill him right there as you did n't give him any reasonable time to leave .
Which Nat'l Parks will now allow guns ?
Thanks Patriot for the well researched response . Although I am not a gun rights advocate , I am also not anti-gun and in the spirit of trying to get the two sides of this issue to reach some sort of understanding , here is what I believe to be the major points of those who support a ban on assult weapons . First of all , I do agree that the definition of assult weapons is a little strange , and it essentially boils down to the guns that look scary . However , the spirit of the law was to try to ban weapons whose main purpose was militaristic in nature . That is , guns that are able to be fired rapidly , have a large magazine , and reasonable stopping power . Thus , although the ban would not eliminate all of the `` dangerous '' weapons ( I assume that an M1 , the rifle that beat the Nazis , would be legal ) it does cover a lot of them . Of course , most 2nd amendment rights supporters would say that all this does n't matter , it does n't matter what purpose the gun serves , it is unconstitutional to infringe upon the rights of Americans to own any gun they want , no matter the purpose . What gun control advocates would say , however , is that the constitution says 'arms ' not guns , and it becomes the job of the goverment to determine what was meant my this . I think that most gun control advocates would agree that the second amendment probably did not intend for people to be able to buy chemical or biological weapons , for example . And , I for one , hope that is not what they meant , particularly in light of the recent war on terrorism . A common remark is `` why would it matter if I had a nuclear weapon if I am a law abiding citizen and would never use it against my neighbor ? '' The problem is that we do n't know what the intention of everyone is , and there are certainly terrorists in this country now who are American citizens and would use such powerful weapons against usif they were able to acquire them . Of course a semi-automatic .223 caliber rifle is not the same as a chemical weapon , but the point is that ( I think ) most people do n't think that you should be able to own absolutely any weapon that you want , so one must attempt to define what is too dangerous for ordinary citizens to own . I do n't think that I covered all of your points , Patriot , but this is getting long , so I will cut this off here , and I hope to get a response from you . I will be interested in your thoughts . -Dan
Normally an incorrect belief of the world would cause you harm or death ( eg . Thinking that you have to eat dirt as apposed to going to the shops ) , and so wrong theories dont hang about for very long ( as any one that knows them is dead ) .
I have gone on record to say I think Christianity does a lot of good in the world . I have even tried to correct Matthew in his anti-Christian tirades . ( Until I gave up realizing it would do no good ... )
they do n't want to except that there is something/someone more powerful than them
Abortion today is used primarily as a birth control of convenience because people are too self-centered to take precautions .
A study published this month in the journal Pediatrics claimed children do better when their same-sex parents are allowed to marry or enter a civil union . According to marriage and family experts , such reporting fails to recognize myriad reports that show kids do better in a home with a biological mother and father .
... to curtail abortions . Any woman who has an abortion for convenience only ( not raped , no incest , no danger to the mother 's life ) shall have both ovaries removed . What do y'all think ?
Because guns are the best method available on the market . Settling for second best when you could have the best is just stupid .
South Africa 's highest court has ruled in favour of same-sex marriages , which are banned under current legislation . The Constitutional Court ordered that parliament amend marriage laws to allow gay weddings within a year . The constitution outlaws discrimination against gays and lesbians , but social attitudes remain more conservative . The court ordered that the definition of marriage be changed from a `` union between a man and a woman '' to a `` union between two persons '' . Last year , the Supreme Court of Appeal had ruled in a case brought by a lesbian couple that the current law discriminated against homosexuals . But the home affairs department went to the Constitutional Court , arguing that only parliament could change the law . `` The common law definition of marriage is declared to be inconsistent with the constitution and invalid to the extent that it does not permit same-sex couples to enjoy the status and benefits it accords heterosexual couples , '' said Justice Albie Sachs in his ruling , AFP reports . After the Supreme Court of Appeal ruled last November that Marie Fourie and Cecilia Bonthuys should be allowed to wed , they later found they were unable to register for a church wedding at the Department of Home Affairs . Keketso Maema , a lawyer for the Lesbian and Gay Equality project , said he was disappointed that the Constitutional Court did not order the immediate legalisation of gay marriages . `` It 's a bit disappointing . It feels like it 's one step forward and still another one step backwards , '' he told Reuters news agency . Church groups in South Africa have argued that the issue should be put to a referendum , and say that most South Africans would oppose the legalisation of gay marriages . South Africa 's constitution - introduced in 1996 - was the first in the world specifically to outlaw discrimination on the grounds of sexual preference .
What price activist judges ?
since you 're the one who wants the taxpayers to foot the bill for this bull .
In some cases , a kind is like a family . Hopefully the site Variation , information and the created kind should be able to answer this question .
I think your point of view is flawed . My perspective is that both mind and body combine to make a person . Each is just as important . Granted , you ca n't really do much if you are in a coma . The other side of the coin is you ca n't do much without a heart , or lungs , or liver . By your reasoning , it would make just as much sense to allow abortions up until the lungs develop . After all , without a healthy set of lungs , you are n't `` you . '' To me , this seems ridiculous . You hit the nail on the head when you said that pro-choicers ( for the most part ) value the fetus less than the value of the mother 's right to her own body . Pro-lifers simply see the value of these two entities as equal . Development of a brain and mind is simply a step along the process of the development of a human being . If we were to translate your reasoning onto the whole of human society , we would value people with superior intellect over those without .
Religious Right Group Claims Same Sex Marriage Leads to Mass Murder By David Corn , Mother Jones Posted on April 10 , 2009 , Printed on April 10 , 2009 Religious Right Group Claims Same Sex Marriage Leads to Mass Murder | | AlterNet Is there a connection between same-sex marriage and mass murder ? That 's what one religious right outfit is suggesting . This week , Morality in Media disseminated a statement noting that the Iowa Supreme Court had legalized gay marriage on the same day that a gunman murdered 13 people in Binghamton , New York . The headline on the release : `` Connecting the Dots : The Line Between Gay Marriage and Mass Murders . '' The group 's president , Bob Peters , notes that the `` underlying problem is that increasingly we live in a 'post-Christian ' society , where Judeo-Christian faith and values have less and less influence . '' And , he continues , this `` secular value system is also reflected in the 'sexual revolution , ' which is the driving force behind the push for 'gay marriage . ' '' Here 's the punch line : It most certainly is not my intention to blame the epidemic of mass murders on the gay rights movement ! It is my intention to point out that the success of the sexual revolution is inversely proportional to the decline in morality ; and it is the decline of morality ( and the faith that so often under girds it ) that is the underlying cause of our modern day epidemic of mass murders . That is , he 's not saying that gay rights activists are directly responsible for the murderous actions of gun-toting madmen . But Peters maintains that those who champion gay rights are undermining the moral fiber of society and that this assault on traditional values creates an environment in which killing sprees can more easily occur . These acts of gun violence , he insists , are the poisoned fruit of the push for gay marriage . Talk about exploiting tragedy to advance an agenda . It might be tempting to dismiss Peters and Morality in Media as marginal , but this group did receive federal funding from 2005 through 2007 . The money supported a Morality in Media project , ObscenityCrimes.org , which paid two retired law enforcement officers to review citizen complaints about obscenity on the Internet and to forward the best leads to the US Justice Department for possible prosecution . A total of $ 300,000 was provided to Morality in Media through two earmarks Rep. Frank Wolf ( R-Va. ) placed into spending bills , according to Peters . And a portion of that money went to cover Peters ' salary . As The New York Times reported in 2007 , no obscenity prosecutions had resulted from the Morality in Media 's obscenity-tracking work . Peters tells me that since 2007 -- thanks to the fuss about earmarks -- he has received no more funds from the US government . After the earmarked grants ran out in 2007 , he did apply directly to the Justice Department and was turned down . Since then , he has raised private funds to keep ObscenityCrimes.org going . That may be for the best -- particularly for Morality in Media . Peters has recently attacked President Barack Obama 's pick for deputy attorney general , David Ogden , as an `` ACLU-minded '' sort who would `` likely weaken '' government efforts `` to curb sexual trafficking and sexual exploitation of children . '' It would be difficult -- or , at least , awkward -- for Peters to blast a Justice Department that was funding his own work . In his statement on gay marriage and mass murder , Peters notes that Christianity and Judaism teach `` that we are to love our neighbors as ourselves and to forgive others . '' But on the subject of gay marriage , he does seem to have a rather unforgiving approach .

Your reasoning of the effects of abortion are correct . The liberals who see abortion as a normal , acceptable , right to choose abortion are aborting themselves into extinction . Reverence , and a love of life is not what motivates Muslims . The power of Islam is . There is nothing to indicate that Muslims `` love '' life . They 'll cut your limbs or head off for nearly any reason . They 'll remove your head with a hacksaw so to take the time for `` you '' the victim to enjoy the moment and to voice your opinion and video it for your family and countrymen to enjoy .
I 'm going to play devil 's advocate for a moment . Suppose this expedition had set out and had n't found the transitional fossil . Would we accept this as falsification of the hypothesis on which the prediction was based ? I suspect not , as we know that fossilisation ( in the first instance ) and the uncovering of said fossils ( in the second ) are contingent , not necessary , events . By Popperian criteria , if we would not accept a nil result as falsification , we can not trumpet a positive result as validation .
It makes more sense to believe in a devine creator , then to believe that every kind of living thing evolved from one another .
The Bible falls completely silent on the issue of abortion . All direct condemnations on abortion found in the New Testament were quickly discarded as irrelevant by theologians . Christianity had it 's chance at condemning abortion in the Bible and choose not to ! For hundreds of years the Vatican supported abortion rights . Even it 's most celebrated saints were not only outspoken supporters but blazed a path for theology to support it . And in early America , it was n't rare for abortion services to be posted on Church bulletinboards . Again , these are facts that the pro-life/Christian-Con movement you never find out about . They would rather have you believe in lies instead for their political agendas .
... the premise of this thread is based on his own anti-YEC/christian bigotry .
What say you now , Sinjin ?
You mention pursuing facts ? I do n't see how that 's possible . For now assume that God created the Earth and the science commnity accepts that . What specific experimentation would you do ? What would you investigate that you feel could further the human pool of knowledge ? How about some specifics ?
Fifty-seven percent ( 57 % ) of Americans say gun sales are up in the United States because of a fear of increased government restriction on gun ownership . A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey shows that just 23 % say gun sales have risen because of a fear of increased crime . Twenty-one percent ( 21 % ) are not sure . Sixty-three percent ( 63 % ) of men say the threat of more gun control is behind increased sales , compared to 51 % of women . Fifty-nine percent ( 59 % ) of whites agree , while African-Americans are more closely divided on the question . Similarly , 65 % of Republicans and 66 % of those not affiliated with either major political party say gun sales are up due to a fear of increased government restriction . But a plurality of Democrats agrees by just 10 points . Seventy-one percent ( 71 % ) of Americans believe it is at least somewhat likely that President Obama will seek tougher gun control laws , including 43 % who say it is very likely . In March , 43 % of Americans said the United States needed more gun control laws , but 47 % disagreed . This marked a slight drop in support for more gun control from last year .

The child could still be born and given up for adoption , and that is a good idea , but maybe the woman will relive the rape throughout the pregnancy by being reminded of it on a daily basis ... .

I will not turn this into another debate that often comes up with this issue . But for the sake of clarification can you tell me if you believe it possible that the rights of the being 's inside the mother are being infringed upon ? That is , when do you deem it worthy of protection ? ( I wo n't debate this , I 'm just curious as to your view ) .

As Mr. Jack said , interesting .
I & # 8217 ; ve never seen this addressed before , I don & # 8217 ; t know if it & # 8217 ; s going to inspire emotion or rational thought , but here goes ; The universe has billions of stars , billions of planets , billions of light years , billions of so many things , yet it only has 5 colors ? Does the scientific community generally believe that & # 8217 ; s all the pure colors that exist throughout the universe , or is it open to the possibility that there could be more , maybe dozens , maybe hundreds , maybe billions ? Could it be that human observation is far more limited than we think ?
No , that is because the courts let the Darwiniacs win in Alabama and not let the stickers be put in the books .
If the child is to be born into a poverty stricken part of the world and is expected to die by the age of 7 by either disease or lack of food , why not spare pain and abort ?
This is a statement written by someone who obviously has not read scripture . One of the most astonising `` proofs '' if you will , that the Bible is of supernatural origin , is predictive prophecy . Science can not , as you claim , `` explain '' everything , and it has no natural explanation for the predictions made in scripture . How can science explain through statistical probablity the over 600 prophecies in Biblical writings that have come to pass ? Also , how can it explain how supposedly uneducated people ( uneducated in the ways of modern science ) wrote about astronomy as if they knew about the universe as we do today . How could they have described the hydrological cycle as we have only come to know it recently ? Ecclesiastes 1:6 The wind goes toward the south , And turns around to the north ; The wind whirls about continually , And comes again on its circuit . How did they know that the earth `` hangs on nothing '' when the accepted norm of the day did not even accept that possibility ? Job 26:7 He stretches out the north over empty space ; He hangs the earth on nothing . How did they know that the `` vapors '' of the earth rise to create moisture , that is seeded by lightning with nitrogen and then falls as rain to fertilze the soil ? Jeremiah 10:13 When He utters His voice , There is a multitude of waters in the heavens : And He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth . He makes lightning for the rain , He brings the wind out of His treasuries. Hydrothermal vents [ 4 ] are described in two books of the Bible written before 1400BCmore than 3,000 years before their discovery by science . Genesis 7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noahs life , in the second month , the seventeenth day of the month , on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up , and the windows of heaven were opened . Even though the Bible is not a scientific text book and does n't purport to be , nowhere is it scientifically inaccurate . In addition , many of the scientific ideas you are so impressed with are nothing new to the Bible . It was speaking of these things long before modern science spoke of them . The story goes `` They ( scientists ) are slowly working their way to the mountain 's peak painstakingly measuring and analyzing every step that they take . After many years of research , they finally arrive at the top of the mountain , scale over its leading edge , only to find a group of theologians sitting there with the answers all along . ''
This is not a case of disagreement on the interpretation of evidence , it is science versus science fiction .
But your way has been tried ZERO times , thank god ... and the current way ( not allowing passengers to bring guns onboard ) has been tried way more times than four ... try millions of times
No they have n't . In the case of the arctic fox it is the ability to change , that is inherited , that is subject to selection . that is nothing but conjecture . Are you telling me that arctic foxes at some point in history did not have this ability ?
If I would have been alive 100 years ago , would I have opposed having evolution taught in schools ? Of course I would have , because I would n't have been able to forsee how the benefits that the study of microevolution , genetics , and other non controversial aspects of evolution have benefited society . Chances are there are equal , undiscovered things about intelligent design that could be discovered it we would give it a chance .
Some evolutionists try to claim that life can indeed climb upward by saying that the organism can draw energy from its environment  which would enable it to defy the downhill slide of degneration [ sic ] .
How do atheists account for the laws of logic in a universe without God ? The Laws of logic are conceptual by nature and absolute . Being absolute they transcend space and time . They are not the properties of the physical universe ( since they are conceptual ) or of people ( since people contradict each other , which would mean they were n't absolute ) . So , how do they account for them ? Examples of logical absolutes are : something can not be itself and not itself at the same time ( Law of non contradiction ) . A thing is what it is ( Law of identity ) . A statement is either true or false ( Law of excluded middle ) . These are simple , absolute logical absolutes . How can absolute , conceptual , abstract laws be derived from a universe of matter , energy and motion ? In other words , how can an atheist with a naturalistic presupposition account for the existence of logical absolutes when logical absolutes are conceptual by nature and not physical , energy , or motion ?
The question one has to ask is it more dangerous for the girl to carry the baby to term or to abort it ?
Please go here . There are some good points on the Archaeopteryx , including a fossil find that shows a more modern bird-like fossil that may predate the Archaeopteryx . Also , from http : //www.answersingenesis.org/docs/1352.asp ( GASP ! ! ! A CREATIONIST SITE ! ! ! ) : In Eichstátt , Germany , in 1984 there was a major meeting of scientists who specialize in bird evolution , the International Archaeopteryx Conference . They disagreed on just about anything that was covered there on this creature , but there was very broad agreement on the belief that Archaeopteryx was a true bird .

Well , that 's generally true of any process that uses energy . Some is wasted .
Yeah , if I were a creationist , I 'd be scared of how fruitful that theory really is too . Coyne 's criticism of `` evolutionary psychology '' as being unscientific . With modifications made by Mike Gene . http : //www.idthink.net/back/coyne/ http : //chronicle.augusta.com/stories ... 24-8577.shtmlb The guy sounds like he 's trying to make a political argument out of this so he can sell more books . This can only be plausible if the victims were killed before they reproduced . But , still evolutionary psychology is tenously at best called `` science . '' Just as most of psychology IMO is barely science , if at all . Exactly . It seems that anyone can dream up hypotheses in evolutionary psychology . Here 's what Coyne said : Sounds plausible . Surely the shoe started simple and became more complex . And surely shoes provide an advantage for survival . According to Coyne and according to Mike Gene , the author of your article , Absolutely NOT .
Undoubtedly dogs ( and other animals ) have an `` emotional life '' but this has nothing to do with morality - which presupposes a self conscious/analytical mind .
From another thread : The head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency is directing people wanting to contribute to give to the Christian charities above . Again , where are the atheist organizations ?
Finally , the ultimate neo-Darwinian taboo has been broken . Wiesmanns barrier has been breached , and in many different forms , some of which I mentioned already ( see box 2 ) .

my question is.. why have n't evolutionists given up already..
That , my friend , is where the wisdom of interpretation - makes sense of the data .
Accidents for one . Just last week a man who was drinking and cleaning his firearm accidentally shot and killed his daughter . Run a google search for `` man shoots self '' the amount of accidental shootings is rather disturbing yet funny . Most of these however are due to improper gun safety though .
Chester- Either answer the question as presented to you , or butt out and shut up . If you 're presented with a question on a school test and you do n't like the way it 's worded , you do n't get to object on the basis that 's it 's a false dichotomy , you have to either answer it or leave it blank .
There 's just enough truth in that statement to keep me from saying it 's false , but if I analyze it , it will help make my point ; The word `` evolution '' has such a broad meaning that it does n't have to mean atheism , but it since it is practically the only weapon that atheists have to combat the religious worldview , that 's what it often DOES mean . If it should n't mean it , but it is used so that it does , then that 's what it actually means . Creationism means religion , but it also involves a belief in the authenticity of historical documents that have been meticulously preserved over thousands of years . That 's not just religion , it 's secular , observed history - something evolution does n't have . So if a person hearing your statement does n't consider it carefully , it 's very easy to be mislead by it . It implies that `` evolution '' ( the branch that declares that the book of Genesis is false ) is somehow a secular , observable truth - while creationism is nothing but a religion , a superstition . Since evolution ca n't prove the book of Genesis ( ancient history ) false , and creationism does have some historical backing , they are comparable and they directly conflict . The problem is , a school teacher can make the statement you made , and it ca n't be legally questioned by anyone . Yet there was a case that I read about somewhere , where a sticker was placed in science textbooks advising children to study evolution `` with an open mind '' , and an ACLU lawsuit ensued . Of all those likely to be mislead by your statement , it 's young impressionable school children . Publicly paid school teachers misleading them with statements like that , without a full explanation ( prohibited by the courts ) does get an establishment of atheism started . It 's what I mean when I say that when church and state are separated , atheism and state are combined . Maybe government could be neutral , if it was small . The U.S. government is no longer small . Do the Christians that you know that believe in evolution , believe that there was no first man named Adam , or that there was no Genesis flood ? The term `` evolution '' needs to be narrowed down - more clearly defined , for these discussions .
You should n't kill children unless absolutly necessary ( and killing them in the womb may be even worse than killing them after they are born , since they have no chance ) .
So I am anti-Christian because I do n't go around posting pro-Christian threads ? Your logic is really skewed . Can I declare you anti-gay cause you do n't frequently post pro-gay threads ?
Better yet , make health insurance coverage , for all but the most trivial of elective procedures , illegal . Treat it for the corrupt and murderous racket it truly is .
at least not the kind you chance-worshiping evolutionists want .
I 'm wondering what it implies that God brought each of the animals to Adam and none of them proved to be a suitable `` helper . '' What exactly does that mean , given the activities that seem to have been carried on between Adam and his proper `` helper '' , Eve ?
How much do you know about it ? You babbled something about `` ... our failure to reason according to evidence and facts , ... '' Did you ? What evidence did you look at for or against evolutionary theory ? What facts did you consider ? Did you , for example , examine thousands of trilobite fossils ? Perhaps you climbed into the Canadian Rockies to look at the fossils in the Burgess shale , none of which represent animals that are living today . Maybe you spent a year or two in the Galapagos with the Grants . So please , tell us how you did not fail to reason according to evidence and facts . But then you continued , `` ... as well as to seek out the constant and unchanging truth contained in God 's Holy Word . '' That has nothing to do with either reasoning or facts . How is that related in any way to evolutionary theory ? Why do you think one must choose one or the other ?

Fundamental Rights This relationship of citizen and state is fundamental to democracy . In the words of the U.S . Declaration of Independence , written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776 : We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . That to secure these rights , governments are instituted among men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed . More specifically , in democracies , these fundamental or inalienable rights include freedom of speech and expression , freedom of religion and conscience , freedom of assembly , and the right to equal protection before the law . This is by no means an exhaustive list of the rights that citizens enjoy in a democracy , but it does constitute a set of the irreducible core rights that any democratic government worthy of the name must uphold . Since they exist independently of government , in Jefferson 's view , these rights can not be legislated away , nor should they be subject to the whim of an electoral majority .
as far as i 'm concerned , marriage is simply a way of providing a stable home life for children , thus giving them a better chance of succeeding outside the home . and it does n't always work !

Indiana Judge Seeks Medical Records AP A court case in Indiana dealing with government access to the medical records of underage girls is getting attention in Kansas . A superior court judge in Indianapolis yesterday said Planned Parenthood of Indiana must turn over to the state records for its clients under age 14 . He rejected arguments that seizure of the records was an unconstitutional violation of the patients ' privacy . The state attorney general 's office wants to look at the records of 84 patients to see if they had illegal underage sex . Kansas Attorney General Phill Kline is fighting a similar legal battle . He says he needs the records of 90 patients at two abortion clinics Wichita and Overland Park for an investigation into child rape and potentially illegal late-term abortions . http : //www.wibw.com/news/headlines/1597431.html
I hear women all the time say its my body so its my choice , but shouldn the father have a say in it . If I slept with my girlfriend and she turned up pregnant , and she wanted to abort , but I want my child to raise and love , I have virtually no legal say in it . This is wrong no matter how you look at it , and yes , I do oppose abortions . Laws should be passed where the abortion can only be performed without the fathers ok if it endangers the life of the mother .

There is a natural need to see clearly , wear clothes , and regulate child birth . Marriage is to promote children bearing and making a family unit .

It is impossible to know if a heterosexual will give birth just the likelihood .
yes , but if we can not even observe the effects of such a deity , what difference does it make to man whether such a God exists or not ? for now , i think we can comfortably conclude that this deity , if he exists , doesnt want to have his existence known . furthermore , this deity doesnt seem interested in interacting with mankind in any physical sense . what good is such a God ? whether he exists or not holds absolutely no bearing on reality .

Even though , evolution is probably simply a tool implemented by God , much of it is simply a matter of consensus concerning vague comparisons of bones declared to be of different ages by people with similar agendas .

By creation we mean the bringing into being by a supernatural Creator of the basic kinds of plants and animals by the process of sudden , or fiat , creation .

This is why we refer to creation as special creation . We can not discover by scientific investigation anything about the creative process used by the Creator. ( italics in original , Duane Gish , Evolution ? The Fossils Say No ! , 1978 , p42 )

Anyone who can quote the Uncommondescent blog as if it were serious science obviously is clueless about evolution . As are the Uncommondescent bloggers . They wear their bibliolatry on their sleeves .
1 ) Refuse to comment upon scientific procedures . 1 . ) Refusing to comment on scientific procedure means absolutely nothing . Maybe we do n't have anything to say . But if you have nothing to say , then how can you refute the point . Yet this does n't stop creationists from attempting to refute established scientific facts with misinformation , ignorance and outright lies . 2 ) When faced with hard facts , move the argument to either a emotional ground , or question the personal , non-scientific beliefs of the evolution believer . 2 . ) Testing your beliefs of your own scientific conclusions is not wrong . Duo_Maxwell 's point is when creationists are incapable of refuting a fact that disproves their worldview , they switch to non scientific tactics that have nothing to do with the veracity of the scientific theory in an attempt to confuse the issue . Such as you did in another thread when you asked `` WOULD YOU BET YOUR LIFE ON IT ? '' Theories in science are continuously tested and in over 150 years the theory of evolution has NOT been falsified . 3 ) Lie like there is no tomorrow 3 . ) I do n't lie dude . Sure you do , probably due to ignorance , but none the less ... ... You said in another thread `` My point exactly . Carbon dating is by no means accurate , there it does not refute creationism . '' Carbon dating and radiometric dating are very accurate . But like any tool , when used improperly , they wo n't give accurate results . But when used properly , they give excellent data . How do we know they are accurate , because they are cross checked , they are verified by other dating methods . Samples that are dated by radiometric dating methods are dated by more than one method before a date is reached . For a sample to be dated by 2 different isotopes and both isotopes are flawed yet give the same date range is simply impossible . Carbon dating ( which is only good for about 50,000 years ) is checked against ice core samples , dendochronology , lake varves , just to name a few other dating methods , and it is virtually always verified . For all these different dating methods to be wrong and still give us the same dates just ca n't happen . 4 ) Refuse to acknowledge anything they simply do n't like 4 . ) Because we do n't give the response you would like is not wrong . No , creationists ignore the data that refutes their points . 5 ) When faced with a point they can not use # 2 on , ignore it completely like it does not exist 5 . ) Do n't think so Then you 've done no research on the subject and have n't read many of the creatinist posts on forums like this one . You did it yourself in the thread where you said this about carbon dating : `` I did n't ignore the quote , I just do n't believe it . There have been many inaccurate test . '' You do n't believe it why ? Have you studied the evidence , do you know how carbon dating works , have you ever carbon dated something and explained the flaws ? No , the only reason you do n't believe it is because it destroys the possiblity of a young earth . You ignore the evidence , sweep it all away with an unsupported `` I do n't believe it '' , that is exactly what point 5 is saying . 6 ) Classical ad-naeseum 6 . ) The only thing classical ad-naeseum is your own preconceived idea 's of creationism and creationist . Preconceived ideas ? ! ? You forget that up until 200 years ago , creationism was the accepted model , based on PRECONCEIVED ideas taken from the Bible . But christian geologists started to look at the evidence and found that the earth could not possibly be only a few thousand years old and there never could have been a global flood . And in all the time since , there has been no evidence found that supports a young earth or global flood and mountains of evidence that refute both . Science is n't about preconceived ideas , science is about finding an explaination for the available data , even if that explaination destroys cherished , PRECONCEIVED ideas that are found to be false . So let 's hear what preconceived ideas science has that are refuted by the evidence ... ... ...

Do n't you care about their `` unborn babies '' ?
as for creationism ... I havent decided how i should define it .
Now tell me , what is wrong with this logic ? If evolution is true , then you can decide anything for yourself . Nothing stops you .
But the interesting thing is evolutionists refer to this survival of the fittest on the level of the INDIVIDUAL . They say that members within the same species are in competition with each other .
When you decide to sin - you are making the decision , not God . He is just allowing it to happen . So you do have free will to make your own choices , but God must `` approve '' those choices .
One group can do a lot more damage because it has a lot more power . The NRA has even been criticized for being a de facto fourth branch of government .

Has the NRA taken away from the power of the people and the representation they should enjoy in Congress according to the Constitution ? Former Supreme Court chief justice Warren Burger complained about the NRA having too much influence in government and misleading the American people :

how many animals do you think were on the Ark ? how many species existed at the time ? the story of the ark does not coincide with contemporary science , but it does work with the rest of Genesis . this is Genesis 2 : 15-23 now bear in mind that all this happened in one day ( day 6 ) . How many species of animals can a man name in a day ? OK , Noah is 9 generations after Adam , and according to the story , a generation was like 200 years on average , plus at the time Noah built the ark , he was some 200 something himself ( cant remember the exact figure ) . so say its 2000 years or so after the creation day . Anyway , its possible that not a lot of speciation took place in that time , plus its arguable that there wasnt a lot of migration away from the Eden area either . so all the animals in the Earth were relatively close-by , and there couldnt have been a great number of new or variant species from the ones originally created . From the Creation to the Flood , the story makes sense . multiply the number of animals Adam named in a day by 2 , and add 25 % for speciation , and thats the number of animals that needed to be in the ark . sounds logical to me but then again , its just a story ...
The National Academy of Sciences studies . Link who issued a 328-page report based on 253 journal articles , 99 books , 43 government publications , a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study . As we can see , this is now undisputed fact .
Whatever , people lying by saying that they lost their jobs because they said they believe in Intelligent Design ? Good ? Bad ? Utterly predictable ? http : //www.expelledexposed.com/index.php/the-truth
Intellegent Design is the study of the idea that certain biological phenomena are too complex to have been evolved from a series of simpler organisms , and therefore must have been created fully functional from the onset . It is based on the idea that if we can observe an organism or an organic function whose existence can not be explained by the successive adaptation of the evolutionary model , then that organism or function is evidence for intelligent design . When intelligent design first emerged , among the long list of examples of irreducibly complex phenomena were the eye , the flagellum and blood clotting . All of these have been shown to have simpler counterparts which also fucntion , and therefore which could have been the evolutionary basis for the emergence of these more complex functions . These examples are summarized in wikipedia 's article Irreducible complexity - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia

Look Bell - your point is made .
Gleick in `` Chaos '' talks of a hypothetical about a scientist who is studying a micro-organism . The scientist describes what he sees under the microscope . Other scientists around the world , with the same organism , can make the same observations , and all concur that organism 'x ' behaves in a particular way . Such repeatable observations make their way into the textbooks . It becomes established as 'fact ' . Yet no one realises that when they are observing this organism , in fact , in order to observe it , they shine a light onto the subject . What if the organism reacts with light . How it 'behaves ' when it is observed is only how it behaves 'when ' it is observed .

I am 50 % sure that God exists and 50 % sure that he does n't . Woo hoo .
I am curious as to why you specifically exclude self defense as a valid reason for owning a gun . Data from the FBI shows that victims who resist an aggressor by use of a gun are less likely to be injured than when they use other weapons for defense . I would think that this alone would validate the ownership of a gun for defensive use . On a related note , as was recently confirmed by the SCOTUS , owning a firearm is an individual right . I am not aware of any other right that you are required to to demonstrate a reason prior to exercising .
But just try and remove them from those that think we do and you will have a war on your hands . It 's too bad we did n't become more like Canada is respect to gun ownership . A lot more people would be alive today and others not sitting in prison for crimes they commited .

Sigh . I knew once I started digging I would unearth NARTH lies ... Let 's start with their claims on the `` twin '' studies , shall we ? From the ACTUAL article they pretend to quote ... Biometric modeling revealed that , in men , genetic effects explained 0.34-0.39 of the variance , the shared environment .00 , and the individual specific environment 0.61-0.66 of the variance ... . In men , the full twin model suggested heritability estimates of 39 % for any lifetime same-sex partner ( 95 % CI:00-59 % ) and 34 % for total number of same-sex partners ( 95 CI : 00-53 % ) , whereas unique environmental factors accounted for 61 % Genetic and Environmental Effects on Same-sex Sexual Behavior : A Population Study of Twins in Sweden Also , quoting the author of the study : Overall , genetics accounted for around 35 per cent of the differences between men in homosexual behaviour and other individual-specific environmental factors ( that is , not societal attitudes , family or parenting which are shared by twins ) accounted for around 64 per cent . In other words , men become gay or straight because of different developmental pathways , not just one pathway. Homosexual behaviour due to genetics and environmental factors Queen Mary , University of London With no surprise , NARTH lied and tried to down-play the genetic results , whereas the ACTUAL STUDY CONFIRMED genetic contribution to sexual orientation . ================================================== ===================== Addition : I saw NARTH quoted `` townhall.com '' , which is absolutely absurd for any scientific pretense . They reference : `` Prager , D. ( 2005 ) . `` College Taught Her Not To Be a Heterosexual . '' Available on the web at : Townhall.com . '' They did n't give a direct link to the article , and when I looked at the article I realized why ... Dennis Prager : College taught her not to be a heterosexual - Townhall.com The article IS NOT scientific by any pretense . Dennis , an editorialist , interviews ONE WOMAN and from there proclaims this individual 's experiences as `` typical '' and proof of his conclusions on millions of college women . And the funny thing is that Dennis reaches this conclusion IN SPITE OF what this woman actually tells him . This woman describes her life experience , and her interpretation of how she came to be where she is today . Dennis , in his thorough lack of knowledge on homosexuals , presumes to contradict her experience . It 's obvious he had reached his opinion long before the interview , and nothing the woman said was going to sway him . And NARTH ACTUALLY CITES THIS in their `` research '' ? ? ? Yet another reason why I think `` NARTH '' should NEVER be confused with legitimate science . They are an organization formed for political purposes and backed by people with political purposes . Political purposes which EXCLUSIVELY revolve around being anti-gay ...

Historically , it is as valid an argument as the argument that some state gun laws were racist after the Civil War . And they could have experienced more without gun control . You 're jumping to conclusions . What is unconstitutional is judges ' interference in matters best left to the legislature . I take a conservative view of the judiciary 's powers under the Constitution .
This is not intended to be a creation evolution debate and I hope folks will refrain from that . I believe that there are characteristics which are solely attributable to humans . Before I post my thoughts I would like to hear others . I do n't wish to influence any answers . So what do you all think . By the Way , `` nothing '' is also a reasonable response , but it will be hard to prove .
Oh , love your sig , btw
Men should n't be deciding because they ca n't get pregnant after being raped . When was the last time a man 's life was ever at risk because his wife was pregnant ?
You have n't done anything to prove any of your arguments . Your disagreements with evolution and science are basically `` I do n't buy it , '' you refuse to refute anything we say , you refuse to back your comments with science , you refuse to back anything you come up with except with weak , vague , factless statements . Heck , you even went so far as to ask us if we would bet our lives on carbon dating ! Our personal belief is irrevelant . What matters is proving or disproving the science factually , something you have failed with flying colors to do .
I 'm now slightly less confused about why I 've never seen this discussed before .
I wonder how far this is going to go seeing how the polls show that a majority in Mass . is in support of same sex marriage . The anti-gay side feels confident that they have the 50 votes to approve this .
Why am I not suprised ? You really should n't have attacked me on grammar and spelling . I 'm going to let you apologize before I make you regret such a action .

By Reduction to the Absurd : Suppose that God is in fact all-powerful . If he is all-powerful , then he can do anything . Yet this raises the question , `` If God can do anything , can he make a rock so hard that he himself can not break it ? '' If the answer is yes , then God can not break this rock , so there is something he can not do . If the answer is no , then he can not make such a rock , and thus there is also something he can not do . Therefore , it is impossible that God can do everything , and it is thus impossible for him to be all powerful . I ca n't claim originality for this proof , but I have never heard any good refutation of it , and yet people still act as if God is all powerful despite the absurdity of such a notion . If there is a refutation , then I 'd like to hear it .

Sure , just as Nicolas Sarcozy , Gordon Brown , Fredrik Reinfeldt , Kevin Rudd , [ et al ] , along with Barack Obama are too . The United States stands alone , at present , among westernized nations , in not guaranteeing health care , and therefore , the only truly democratic nation left on the planet ! At the next teabagging party , they should carry signs of the leaders of all the westernized nations , including the U.S. President , with tiny moustaches . Israel is reputed to have an excellent health care system , and ranks 28th , internationally . See this tape of an anti-semitic woman pathetically shouting `` Heil Hitler '' to an Israeli man speaking highly of Israel 's national health system . Woman Shouts `` Heil Hitler !

Yes , 1 ) It 's against Gods Law-an Abomination . 2 ) God loves the gay people but hates the Sin- there is help- I can get any gay person in contact with someone who used to be gay and has been set free and he will be willing to help , just let me know and i will get his websight to you and his phone number if you like . 3 ) Jesus loves you and you still have a chance to have questions answered that no one in the secular world can answer .
a vaguely defined entity can not be believed in or disbelieved , because it is unidentifiable , and therefore someone that claims to believe in it has nothing to believe in , and does not know what it is they claim to believe in . as such , believing in God is no different from not believing in God , because neither the believer nor non-believer could indentify what it is they believe in or disbelieve in .
Do n't be silly -- no one is voting your family out of existence . Though it might make a fascinating Criss Angel or David Blane trick . This is simply about whether or not any group that wants to come along and redefine marriage should get to do so . I agree it 's not an 'academic exercise ' , but not for the same reason you think . I no more take 'pleasure and joy ' from something like this than any other public act of due process , e.g . voting to change the speed limit . Frankly , I 've always thought it was pretty odd -- if not downright disturbing -- that some gay pride proponents seem to hold up the legality of their union as the determinant of their joy and emotion , when they are completely free to have whatever union they want regardless . After all , no one 's going to block the door to the chapel , and I can guarantee you I 'd be joyfully married with or without that piece of paper called a license .
II am 61 years old , and I can remember when schools filled the gap and taught morals . Now they are not allowed for fear that they might offend someones religious unbelief and be sued . We reap what we sow . If we sow nothing , we reap nothing .
You still have n't showed us where he is a self proclaimed Conservative Christian rather than just a conservative republican OP . Would you care to support that claim with actual evidence or is it your intent to once again just lump everyone on the Right into the same pot of Funamental Christianity so as to slander us all as a group ? Is that your idea of fair and honest debating ? Some might take lies about them as personal slanderous attacks on their character and respond in kind . I thought you believed in elevating the quality of debate to being intellectually honest ?
Some people does n't mean a typical gun owner . Would it be reasonable to say that black people are robbers because a group of three black kids robbed a convinience store ?
Sigmund Freud divided all people into `` believers '' and `` unbelievers. Unbelievers include all those who consider themselves cynics , skeptics , scoffers , agnostics , or atheists . Believers include the rest , whose belief ranges from merely an intellectual assent that someone or something is out there to those like Lewis , Augustine , Tolstoy , and Pascal who have had a life-transforming experience after which their faith becomes the primary motivating and organizing principle of their lives . Freud came down clearly and strongly against the notion that there is `` Anyone '' out there . He described his worldview as secular and called it `` scientific , '' and he claimed that no source of knowledge of the universe exists other than `` carefully scrutinized observation what we call research . '' Therefore no knowledge , he said , can be derived from revelation or from intuition . He stated that the notion of the universe created by a being `` resembling a man but magnified in every respect , an idealized superman , reflects the gross ignorance of primitive peoples . '' He stated that no intelligent person could accept the absurdities of the religious worldview . Freud described the concept of God as merely a projection of the childish wish for the protection of an all-powerful father . He added that `` religion is an attempt to master the sensory world in which we are situated by means of the wishful world which we have developed within us as a result of biological and psychological abnormality . '' He concluded that the religious view is `` so pathetically absurd and . . . infantile that it is humiliating and embarrassing to think that the majority of people will never rise above it . '' Except for the brief time as a college student under the influence of a brilliant philosopher named Franz Bratano , a devout believer , when Freud wavered in his atheism , he stated that he remained an unbeliever all of his life . A year before he died , Freud wrote to Charles Sanger , `` Neither in my private life nor in my writing have I ever made a secret of being an out-and-out unbeliever . '' When we carefully assess the record , however , we find that Freud may not have been quite as adamant in his atheism as he proclaimed . Certainly he did refer to himself often as , `` an infidel Jew , '' and he rejected outright the religious view of the universe , especially the Judeo-Christian view . He certainly attacked this view with all his intellectual might and from every possible perspective . Yet , for some reason he remained preoccupied with these issues ; he just could not leave them alone . He spent the last thirty years of his life writing about them . In an autobiographical study he said that these philosophical and religious issues interested him throughout his life from early youth . A great deal of evidence exists that Freud 's worldview proved less than comfortable for him . Faith was by no means a closed issue for him , and he was extremely ambivalent about God 's existence . Anna Freud , Sigmund 's daughter who died a few years ago , explained to me the only way to know her father : `` Do n't read his biographies ; '' she instructed , `` read his letters . '' Throughout Freud 's letters are statements such as , `` If someday we meet above , '' `` [ my ] one , quite secret prayer , '' and statements about God 's grace . During the last thirty years of Freud 's life , he carried out a continuous exchange of hundreds of letters with a Swiss theologian , Oskar Phister . It 's interesting to note that his longest correspondence was with this theologian . He admired Phister and wrote , `` You are a true servant of God . . . [ who ] feels the need to do spiritual good to everyone he meets . You did good this way even to me . '' He later said that Phister was , `` In the fortunate position of being able to lead men to God . '' Source : : Click Here Armand M.

If abortion is made illegal I predict that you will see across the border abortion clinics , in canada and states that still premit abortion . Are we to fill the prisons with those seeking abortions in places where it is legal if they live in states that do not allow abortions ? Prolifers better becare for what they wish for . Prolifers tend to be conservative and do not like taxes . They better get ready to pay , in taxes , for the extra prisons and social programs needed for all those abandoned children .
Its good to see the senate isnt agreeing .
First Paragraph : `` christianity is living a lifstyle patterned after the teachings , actions and philosophies of christ . '' Sure , not a bad definition . `` in order to do this , you must accept that the records of christ 's life are fact . '' Every single word in the gospels ? No , not at all . Remember , the works which became the new testament were around for centuries before they were actually compiled into the Bible . And none of the originals still exist . Who knows what changes were made to the account of Jesus 's life before they were finally compiled . For example , look at Matthew 10:34 `` Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth . I did not come to bring peace but a sword . '' Does n't sound much like Jesus , does it ? It certainly does n't fit into the picture that 's generally painted of Jesus . In the end the New Testament was written and compiled by mistake prone people . Some may believe that it 's the unadulterated word of God , but looking at the above passage it 's also easy to believe that it 's also the work of common people . The rest of the paragraph rather depends on accepting that line , and I believe I 've shown that a reasonable person might not , so I 'm going to skip to your next paragraph .
Parallels that Are n't Parallel The key question in any slippery slope appeal is whether the two situations are truly similar in a morally relevant way . If not , then the illustration is guilty of a logical slippery slope fallacy . The analogy fails and the argument falls apart . Are there important differences between pregnancy and kidnapping ? Yes , many . First , the violinist is artificially attached to the woman . A mother 's unborn baby , however , is not surgically connected , nor was it ever `` attached '' to her . Instead , the baby is being produced by the mother 's own body by the natural process of reproduction .
the problem then is , how could the universe begin in the midst of absolutely nothing ( no time , no matter , no space , no energy ) ? what could possibly trigger the universe 's beginning ? ( and then of course , where did these triggering events come from ? ) you will end up at negative infinity at some point
This crushes ToE at the most fundamental level .
It 's kind of funny that they claim this happened , but ca n't get the woman to come out and say it ?
ABC aired a special on the effectiveness of CCW on campus . They had a student take a concealed weapons class ( who had never fired a gun before ) . After the class , they put him in a classroom with 20 or so people dressed in protective gear and face shields . They armed him with a simunition pistol ( a pistol that fires non-lethal rubber projectiles used for training ) . In the middle of a simulated college `` instruction period '' , a police SWAT team member charged in and started shooting . This was to conduct an `` experiment '' to see if students carrying concealed weapons was an effective means of stopping a mass killer . Guess what happened ? When the `` shooter '' busted into the classroom , the armed `` student '' immediately went for his gun , got it tangled in his shirt tail , and was shot with a simunition round . The conclusion reached by ABC and `` proven '' was that CCW was ineffective in a mass shooting scenario . DUH ! ! ! What a surprise ! A complete novice with only three hours of basic firearms experience was instantly killed by the TRAINED POLICE OFFICER WITH 15 YEARS EXPERIENCE AS A SWAT TEAM MEMBER ! Yup . Having an experienced CCW holder who is familiar with modes of carry , clearing concealment garments during presentation , basic defensive firing positions , and has practiced extensively with his firearm go against an emotionally imbalanced , drug or alcohol affected , common shooter is n't a real test . You have to put a young , inexperienced , trainee with THREE WHOLE HOURS of firearms familiarity up against a DECORATED SWAT TEAM MEMBER . This is considered `` scientific proof '' that CCW is no good by ABC .
Another theistic evolutionist that I would consider to be sincere could easily have the same ignorance of the Bible as Miller , but the difference is that Miller wrote a book attempting to compare the two ( evolution vs. Christianity ) and he has no excuse for being largely uninformed on one of the two subjects that he 's trying to compare .

First , it neglects to mention that there is a moral code in every society , even atheistic ones . They may not claim divine source or similar for it , but informal rules of `` this is done , and this is NOT done '' emerge . Always .
So many questions arise in the study of fossils ( paleontology ) that even many evolutionary paleontologists put little stock in the fossil record . Basing one 's belief in evolution on the shaky ground of paleontology can scarcely be considered scientific.35 `` We are about 120 years after Darwin and the knowledge of the fossil record has been greatly expanded . We now have a quarter of a million species but the situation has n't changed much . The record of evolution is still surprisingly jerky and , ironically , we have fewer examples of evolutionary transition than we had in Darwin 's time . '' - Dr. David M. Raup , Curator of Geology , Museum of Natural History , Chicago14 ( http : //www.straight-talk.net/evolution/fossil.htm )

What do you mean by call the shots ? I think a mother should be able to cease providing for a child/fetus at any age , but also should not be able to kill it at any age . I do n't think time with regards to pregnancy is a relevant dimension . Realistically this means a mother can decide whether her child lives or not up until some point in the 3rd trimester , since its around then a fetus is capable of surviving outside the womb . This is of course , dependent on technology .
Your god is also the god of deceit . Why else would he erase all evidence of such a flood ? Why erase the bones from the animals that must have died as the emigrated from the arks resting place ? Answer those two and I 'll have lots more

A fairer comparison for science as a whole would be the inner way of thinking and knowing , as contrasted to that based on external empiricism . I think that has far more staying power .
that you cherry-pick just that evidence which seems to support your preconceptions rather than critically applying your hypothesis to all the available evidence ,
Certainly , because with calm empathy you can casually address such a matter simply because the struggle does not pertain to you personally . To be able to put into question the love of another human being is simply not only alarming in nature , but damning to the very definition of love , equality , and freedom in creation of man ... . And to trump this as a question of morality only serves as a mask to curtail the prejudice objections one personally has to a ceremony , right , and relationship that person will not even be personally affected by ... .

Common sense says that if we are all on a downhill slide that mutation/selection  being the conservative/degenerative devicees that they are -- could have never have explained the origin of anything . Our genomes could not have arisen spontaneously . Instead , our genomes were designed by a designer .
Maybe you could show us evidence that your assertion of the `` illusion '' of adaptation and long term evolution has been observed . The burden of proof is on you , my dear . :
After all , a 2 day old baby is no more valuable or independent potentially speaking than an unborn child is 2 days before it 's born , but the 2 day old child has all of the rights that you have to life .

Furthermore , if Mexico is making an earnest attempt to smash the cartels and we 're financing it in part , would n't we want to help reduce the weapons traffic flowing south into the cartel 's arsenals ?
This creation must have been enacted by another power , because to claim that something may create itself is highly circuitous and is the epitome of false logic .

I certainly would NOT want someone forced to do something against their religious beliefs .

I 'll bet it did . Did any of you money go out to them ? Do any of you volunteer to go out to them ? How are you different from me in this case and why is this relevant to evolutionary theory ?
But why take my word for anything ? Since we are talking about children , lets take a look at what pediatricians ( the American Academy of Pediatrics ) say .
Uhhh , congratulations .
That interpretation is fine except that God says , `` I WILL make a helper suitable for him . '' He had n't made the animals yet in verse 18 , but he created Adam in verse 7 .

Why bother when you know logic , rational thinking and womens rights always take second seat to antiquated belief system dogma ?
Thank you Lurch . You have gotten to my point : Evolution ( as taught in modern public school textbooks ) is a religion , not a scientific fact ( as claimed by sarablaze ) .
the baby belongs to GOD , the mother the dr. and any one else involved are condemned , yu see its called murder , purely in the first degree .

im sorry he was killed
It is actually quite simple . The question is `` When can a woman kill the fetus ? `` . I would say that , if it is out of her body , then none of her critical rights are being violated and she has no right to kill it .
It is our contention that it 's the pro-death advocates who misrepresent the facts in order to justify their infanticidal proclivities and justifications as they release women of all personal responsibility and expect the innocent child to be sacrificed at the alter of their immoral lifestyle so they can continue to act irresponsibly .

Many of the Free French forces were initially not French nationals . Overall 65 % were West African conscripts - largely from Senegal [ citation needed ] . The Foreign Legion included many non-French soldiers . Other contingents were Moroccan , Algerian and Tahitian ( the latter serving with particular distinction in the Western Desert ) . 17,000 Senegalese died defending France in 1940 , many being shot by the Germans after being taken prisoner . Finding an all-white division that was available proved to be impossible due to the enormous contribution made to the French Army by West African conscripts . The 2nd Armoured Division was chosen to lead the Liberation of Paris as it had only 25 % black troops . [ 4 ]
I can not agree with Stephen Grescott . I extremely doubt the fact that most scientists do n't know what science is , we learned the definition of science in simple high school biology . Hopefully someone who has a degree in science knows what it is or the college is horrible . You can also not expect the definition given to be accepted as a neutral definition , when it 's from such a biased source as answersingenesis.org . From dictionary.com : `` The observation , identification , description , experimental investigation , and theoretical explanation of phenomena . '' This is the first definitioin , let me know if you disagree and you think one of the lower definitions is the correct one , but they do n't seem to pertain to actual science in the classroom ( packing a suitcase down to a science , etc . ) Science is not `` a murky combination of facts and theories '' in the classroom , but the evidence is taught along with the theories . It is taught that theories are not fact but that they basically mean that the conclusion reached with the evidence we have right now is that theory , since no one has falsified it , and all predictions made have been correct .
I have a little doubt about this cat diet story . My great grandmother had cats , and she always fed them cooked chicken from the farm . I remember her showing me how she used the chicken parts . My grandfather raised kittens from this cat family and he fed them store cat food in cans , which had been cooked . ( My grandmother passed away before I knew her . She drowned the unwanted kittens , according to family stories . ) But I remember playing with the cats . And then my mother inherited cats from the same litters and she feeds them dry cat food and canned cat food . The cats I grew up with in our home had litters , and so our present cat is about 8 or 9 generations along and is perfectly healthy . All along they were house cats and never allowed outside to catch birds or mice , so far as my mother recallls . ( There is only one kitty now , because my Dad does n't like cats and my sister developed an allergy , which seemed related to cats -- but she is over this now . ) All of them were fed cooked food . So the story about cats does not ring true with me . BTW , all the cats I knew from my grandfather to present lived to about 16-20 years old . And none of them died due a specific disease .

No it is not . Darwinists say that evolution happens by way of selection of random variants ... ..what I 'm asking for is for science to make sure the variants do n't arise nonrandomly . I 'm looking for experiments on animals that rule out heritable , adaptive variation .
It 's simple , really . This grand experiment in self rule and governing was based on the ideals of many of the world 's great phiosophers . Make no mistake , many of the framers of our laws were voracious readers of history and world governments through the years , and as such , realized quite early , laws , outlining the functions of government , needed to be spelled out as much as possible to ensure that government was fair and equitable for all .

After all , you do n't judge the quality of a country 's highways by looking at its dirt roads , do you ? The difference now is that healthcare in the US is n't a scarce resource . You can spend as much as you like for whatever tests , etc. , that you want . Put it under government control and cap the spending , THEN it will become a scarce resource .
Think of what our country would have become over the last 100 years without an armed government .
Since we already had one example of a Creationist lowlife tactic in the George Gaylord Simpson quote , I decided to skim the site and see if I could find another . I did .
That 's because you have the wrong premise to begin with . Gays are the ones trying to enact something here by changing the institution of marriage .
Removal of body parts by whatever means does not change the dna of the rest of the body . The sperm cells and eggs are not affected by the loss of unrelated body parts .
You prove my point exactly . Just because 99 % of scientists believe in evolution , why should I ? You are right , by catering to evolutionists we are getting behind in our education .
Why do you say a mutation is a loss of information ?
The death penalty assures that an incorragable criminal never has the opportunity to kill anybody else . In prison , the criminal could a ) kill another inmate , 2 ) kill a guard , 3 ) escape and kill a civilian , 4 ) have their sentence commuted and get out to commit another crime .
You can rattle off all sorts of data ( real or imagined ) .
so how still thinks it would work better in the US ? full story http : //www.smh.com.au/news/national/ ... 455665717.html
The definitions : The actual law : As should be plainly obvious , this is an almost total ban on all semi-automatic weapons in the City of Columbus , not just those that have been traditionally considered 'assault weapons ' ( automatic firearms ) . Note definition ( L ) ( 2 ) . Almost every semi-automatic pistol is included in that definition . Whether an all-out ban on guns is good or bad ( or constitutional ) , or an assault-weapons ban is good or bad ( or constitutional ) , it should be obvious to any reader that the Columbus city council is trying to push through an all-out ban on guns by calling this an assault weapons ban .
Just for the sake of argument , let 's assume evolutionists had trouble explaining away the tongue of the woodpecker . How in any sense is creationism the alternative ? :
Welcome to America where democracy only works when the people are opposing lawlessness and sin ... since the 1950s there has been an exponential progression to kick God out of the land .
But of course , it was absolutely wrong .
Oddly enough I found Thomas 's opinion to be most compelling . The dissent was surprisingly weak ... even for a dissent . It did n't even really make sense . The actual opinion was kinda weak but I got bored reading it so I skimmed the second half . Ha .
Yes . I would .
Now name one country with universal socialized healthcare with a population of 300 million citizens modulus , just one if you can . Your exemplar countries are tiny in comparison to us so lets get realistic and compare apples to apples for once , ok ?
And you believed every word they fed you without a second thought . At least now we know whose line you 're peddling . Please , cite your sources to start with in the future . It 's not just a good idea , it 's the rules .

Yes . Evolutionisim is highly flawed . Lets start with the appearance of land animals . Fishes evolve to form lungs . How ? That would take millions of years . Next , when animals formed .

The most practical triumph of science over religion is not the acceptance of the fact of evolution by the pope , or of the acknowledgement of a heliocentric solar system ... it was in the seventeenth centuary , when churches began to put up lightning conductors
Evolutionists often claim Evolutionary biology has moved past Darwins model but they never specify what it has moved to . Natural selection doing some mysterious thing to a collection of genomic accidents is the only materialist explanation Ive heard for the origin of biological novelty . ( How could natural selection ( premature death ) , possibly create anything ? Natural selection can only select that which is already created , and RM & amp ; NS is the only detailed materialistic explanation Ive heard suggested for such creation . All other explanations include some form of intelligent , purposeful organization . If that organizing intelligence is internal , that would make it no less no less intelligent . Theism is compatible with the concept of a natural organizing intelligence , but theism is not the only alternative to materialism . For instance : All living systems have some ability to respond to stimuli , intelligently and purposefully . Inanimate objects do not . All living systems have some of our own ability to override automatic function in times of emergency , and make novel , fallible , spontaneous , subjective choices . Living systems have ability to monitor their own level of function , recognize weaknesses , and to explore novel responses . Furthermore if function is not immediately restored , intelligently organized biological systems have the ability to explore other possibilities immediately , without being removed from action by natural selection . If some people choose to call the creative intelligence of nature god , I have no objection . As an agnostic , I dont speculate about the origin of mass , energy , electromagnetism , gravity , creative intelligence -- or anything else . Fanatical evangelical atheists would be the only people who feel obligated to do battle against the term intelligent design . http : //30145.myauthorsie.com/

1 . As per nature 's plan ? Minus the interference of those who place more importance on the right to destroy than that of life that depends wholly on them . 2 . The born do not have the ability to dwell inside other people . They would drown or starve to death since the mechanics to achieve this are not in place . Bearing children is the job of women since they are the ones equipped for the job . Responsibility is a choice all must `` endure '' with each new adventure in life . Including the results of a pleasant night .
Guns surely have their uses in situations such as that . I support peoples right to own a gun but I also think there would be more crimes and death if everyone in the whole country owned a gun . Just got to make sure gun use does n't get too out of hand .
I tried to address this in my original post . So I still maintain that reproduction is not a requirement for qualifying as living .
the fact that the world is governed by laws of logic is exactly what eliminates god . since logic exists , god is not needed . i suppose you assume that logic needs an intelligent initiator of some sort in order for it to exist ? why ? logic dictate that adding quantity causes that quantity to increase . this would occur with or without god 's existence and needs no devine intervention to be consistently true . logic dictates that a system in equilibrium has a total of equal opposite forces and that the sum of all the forces in the system is 0. this is not contingent on god 's presmce either . the more explanations of phenomena that can be logically explained , the less god is needed . god and logic are indirectly proportionate . an increase in logic causes a decrease in god

It is quite understandable that religiously motivated opposition to same-sex civil marriage shapes the basis for legal opposition to same-sex marriage , even if only indirectly . Religious objections to same-sex marriage are supported by thousands of years of tradition and biblical interpretation . The belief that the sanctity of marriage would be undermined by the inclusion of gay and lesbian couples bears a striking conceptual resemblance to the expressed secular rationale for maintaining the tradition of marriage as a union between dual-gender couples , but better identifies the source of the opposition . Whether expressly or impliedly , much of society rejects same-sex marriage due to sincere , deeply ingrained even fundamentalreligious belief . Yet , such views are not the only religious views of marriage . As demonstrated by amicus groups , other equally sincere groups and people in Iowa and around the nation have strong religious views that yield the opposite conclusion.31 This contrast of opinions in our society largely explains the absence of any religion-based rationale to test the constitutionality of Iowas same-sex marriage ban . Our constitution does not permit any branch of government to resolve these types of religious debates and entrusts to courts the task of ensuring government avoids them . See Iowa Const . art . I , § 3 ( The general assembly shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion . . . . ) . The statute at issue in this case does not prescribe a definition of marriage for religious institutions . Instead , the statute declares , Marriage is a civil contract and then regulates that civil contract . Iowa Code § 595A.1 . Thus , in pursuing our task in this case , we proceed as civil judges , far removed from the theological debate of religious clerics , and focus only on the concept of civil marriage and the state licensing system that identifies a limited class of persons entitled to secular rights and benefits associated with civil marriage . _____ 31 Many religions recognize same-sex marriage , such as Buddhists , Quakers , Unitarians , and Reform and Reconstructionist Jews . Schuman , 96 Geo . L.J . at 2108 . Amicus curiae Iowa and National Faith Leaders , Communities , and Scholars point out the United Church of Christ encourages , but does not require , its local congregations to adopt wedding policies that do not discriminate between heterosexual , gay , and lesbian couples , while the Episcopal Church permits priests to perform liturgies and blessings at same-sex weddings as a matter of pastoral care . Additionally , many groups and clergy within various religions are working to achieve inclusion of same-sex marriage . Id . at 210809 .
From memory we spent one or two classes on it . We talked about black moths became more common after pollution and how Larmack was dismissed because there is no way for say a giraffe parent to pass on the fact it was always stretching its neck to its offspring .

http : //nytimes.com/2005/02/19/national/19catholic.html Catholic Group Receives 1,092 New Sex Abuse Reports By NEELA BANERJEE Published : February 19 , 2005 WASHINGTON , Feb. 18 - Roman Catholic bishops reported on Friday that they had received 1,092 new accusations of sexual abuse by priests as they released the second annual survey of the church 's procedures for handling and preventing such abuse by clergy and employees . Kathleen McChesney , executive director of the Office of Child and Youth Protection of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops , said the overwhelming majority of the accusations , which were made against 756 priests , concerned incidents that took place about 30 years ago . Twenty-two accusations of abuse were made by children in 2004 , and they were all turned over to the police , Dr. McChesney said . The findings were released on Friday by the national conference , which has hired independent auditors to assess the church 's response to the sex abuse scandals that exploded in 2002 . Dr. McChesney said the costs to the church had exceeded $ 800 million since 1950 . Last year alone the costs from settlements , therapy for victims and offenders , and lawyers ' fees came to about $ 139.6 million , according to the report . The 1,092 new accusations of abuse were made by 1,083 people , mostly men . Last year the bishops released an analysis conducted by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York , based on figures from bishops and religious orders , that found 10,667 minors had allegedly been abused from 1950 to 2002 . The actual number of victims will probably remain unknown because many people never come forward , Dr. McChesney said . `` We were n't surprised by the numbers because many people are still finding the courage to come forward , '' Dr. McChesney said , `` and the church is in a better place to accept those allegations . '' . . .

Let me propose the shoe fetish as an evolutionary adaptation . Well define a shoe fetish as follows : a person , usually male , can only become sexually aroused when shoes are involved in the sexual act . Mind you , Im not an expert on the shoe fetish , so my definition may be inaccurate . But that need not stop me from doing a little evolutionary psychology here .

Senate to vote on concealed weapons measure - Yahoo ! News So what kind of message is the NRA sending ? That it does n't really matter if people who carry around deadly weapons are able to hit a target at the shooting range or if they understand the law about when they can legally use their weapons or if they have drinking problems and sometimes get in fights ? The NRA talks about respecting the right of self defense but it 's clear they want rights without responsibilities . If they really believed in self defense then it seems that they would be pushing for legislation that required people that carry to obtain a minimum level of training so that they would be in a better position to defend themselves rather than supporting legislation that undermines state gun laws . Now come the slippery slope arguments or the `` well it 's a right '' arguments ... .
I think a more telling question would be , why the hell would you rather feel constantly threatened than feel safe ? It seems completely idiotic to me . Smiley
Upon what basis would discussion be acceptable if not scripture ? If we are to debat the topic , what sources for informational purposes do you consider as `` authoritative '' ?
I dont care how many frauds you can copy paste and quote .
As for the other ones , I would urge you to check them for context and get the whole quotes . Not the ones that are spoonfed you by creationist sites . Chances are that most , if not all of them do n't say what you think they say .
I do n't see anyone protesting at this `` joke . '' A good joke is at least based on some reality .
Evolutionists have screwed up in that they have always assumed that the gene is the fundamental unit of life , that complexity goes no further down in the organism and that what determines what or who you are stops at your genes ! FALSE !
And that fear could motivate the criminals to be armed themselves- thus putting the public in more danger . Such a fear could start an arms race . Try looking at the big picture .
Biomorphs are an embarrassing attempt to explain just how a complex structure such as an eye might come about by gradual mutations , except they only do this by fooling you into believing the program mimics a natural possibility - when it ca n't , not when you are running the program and interfering at will .
The bottom line : Evolution can not be disproved as it has already been proven . Creation can not be disproved except in regard to errant conclusions related to the timing of events . Evolution is the method that God used to create all things .
It is not the role of individuals to exact revenge for crimes committed against them . You do n't get to take the law into your own hands . Munir Hussain ran after the intruders and beat them up with a cricket bat in the street . That 's not self-defence , that 's revenge .
The reason for that is , that Creationism can never be proved or disproved .
Democrats have consistently lead the charge for gay equality , consistently opposed by Republicans .
Do you think the God will be happy with abortion ?
The memo is real , nobody has ever been able to disprove it . Handgun Control Inc. ( the people who later became the Brady Campaign ) have claimed that the memo is a hoax and that what was released has never been their official position . However them simply stating this , is no different than Obama making a statement on national news , and then several months later saying `` I never said that '' and trying to reverse his position . Until it can be proven beyond doubt as being untrue and simple propaganda , the memo is real and explains in detail exactly what the gun control groups are after .
Why would such a scheme exist ? People do n't create conspiracies on a whim ; they exist to achieve a goal , specifically some sort of gain that can not be achieved legitimately . At first glance , there seems to be no gain to be made by adoption of ToE : not money nor power nor reputation .
Your argument is a load of garbage to someone who actually has knownledge about the civil war .

There is considerable confusion about the legal theory underlying the `` right to keep and bear arms '' . This is a brief outline for a clarification of the discussion of this issue . > ( 1 ) The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not establish the right to keep and bear arms . None of the provisions of the Constitution establish any `` natural '' rights . They recognize such rights , but the repeal of such provisions would not end such rights . Such rights were considered by many of the Framers as obvious or `` self-evident '' , but they were immersed in the prevailing republican thought of the day , as expressed in the writings of Locke , Montesquieu , Rousseau , Madison , Hamilton , and others , which discussed `` natural rights '' in some detail . Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights . That has turned out to have been a good idea > ( 2 ) The right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government . This was clearly the understanding and intent of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution and was a long-established principle of English common law at the time the Constitution was adopted , which is considered to be a part of constitutional law for purposes of interpreting the written Constitution .
Your post was fine until you started into the `` demonizing '' bit . Why did you feel the need to get in that dig ? It 's sad that the pro-choice movement has resorted to portraying a desire to protect the life of the unborn as `` demonizing '' women . Intellectual dishonesty .
I 'm against abortion but pro-choice . Whether the fetus is human is not something that I think is really relevant to the matter , and in any case where we give it the benefit of the doubt it is still permissable to carry out abortions in order to safeguard a woman 's autonomy .
... Also , the baby has its own blood , its own immune system , and contains its own calories once consumed . theres nothing that the mother has that the baby doesnt other than it just needs nutrtion . Just like you need food everyday ...
Creation science presents the idea that genesis in every detail is just as solid a science as any other . Do `` creation scientists '' actually beleive they can trick new people or is it an attempt to keep the converts .

I am not disputing that Christians forged texts that much is apparent from the historical sources , ( Archie 's obsession with theological sources is misguided here hence the comedy value of his posts , Does he really want me to slap him with the Mahabharata again ? The compilation is a historical event with specific characters , thus his vague theological link misses entirely . ) however that does not hold true for *all* the texts which have been omitted and the decisions were taken by individuals . Frankly I could n't give a rats arse about it , it 's an ancient historical footnote . However the amount of flak coming up from both ends of the religious spectrum does suggest I 'm onto something and their continued attempts to redirect to the canon would suggest that there & # 8217 ; s something in the omitted texts they 're uncomfortable with .
This is a rather ambiguous and misleading request , though I 'm sure you did n't intend it to be . The question is not 'does lamarckian-style inheritence ever/never occur ' , but 'where does epigenetic inheritance fit into evolution ?

I 'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you , but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species .

This assumes that land is equally suited to arable and pastoral farming . In reality that is n't the case , upland areas are generally unsuitable for crops , whilst lowland areas are usually used for arable .
And the reason for this is they do not accept the notion that the environment can cause a mutation . Thus , they simply chicken out when it comes to any testing that would falsify their theory . However , what they DO do , is resort to confusing people by playing around with bacteria and other assorted organisms in the lab .

Shh shhh it 's ok mellow mellow mellow . Relax you have managed to go from legalizing gay marriage to a collapse of our legal system and the downfall of man 's ability to reason and govern himself in two paragraphs .

You may have more in common with gay people than you think .

The Brady Center has released a report on President Obamas performance called President Obamas First Year : Failed Leadership , Lost Lives . The Presidents concessions to the guns anywhere mentality of the gun lobby and lack of leadership for common-sense gun laws has earned him a grade of F . President Obama signed legislation letting people carry concealed weapons in national parks and in checked luggage on Amtrak trains , adopted the gun lobbys empty rhetoric about just enforcing the laws on the books ,  and muzzled Cabinet members who expressed support for stronger gun laws . In addition , the White House voiced no objection to people carrying guns near Presidential events and his White House staff removed statements from the White House website that declared support for gun violence prevention laws . What a traitor !

They should be discredited , and their hypocrisy should be exposed . Here we have people trying to deny other people the right to marry , supposedly in `` defense '' of `` traditional marriage , '' when some of them are out sneaking around , cheating on their wives , and lying about it when confronted . The only reason this guy admitted the truth is because evidence surfaced about his visits to prostitutes . Meanwhile , has has tried to advance his political career at the expense of gay people . Some defender of marriage ! This is a classic example of someone needing to get the log out of his own eye .
You seem to be arguing that a corpse is a human .
They used to keel over regularly before modern medicine and my wife has been on medication for a thyroid condition ever since she delivered . `` During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , between 1 percent and 1.5 percent of all births ended in the mother 's death as a result of exhaustion , dehydration , infection , hemorrhage , or convulsions . Since the typical mother gave birth to between five and eight children , her lifetime chances of dying in childbirth ran as high as 1 in 8 . This meant that if a woman had eight female friends , it was likely that one might die in childbirth . ''
The interesting thing about the 'quality of life ethic ' is that , in a pro-choice framework , it means that we ca n't degrade anyone 's quality of life without their permission . So far from entailing a cull of the elderly , the infirm , the handicapped , and the ugly , the quality of life ethic entails that we can not kill them off . Each person is entitled to the quality of life that they desire where what they desire does not infringe on other 's quality of life .
As I 've stated in the other thread , I 'm not a judge and I would n't rule on this . Life is not a simple matter of black and white , cut and dried answers . There can be extenuating circumstances -- if you have the intelligence to get to understanding that point .

No need to change the verbage : `` ... individuals with variations that are fortuitously best suited to changing local environments .

They just were n't as successful in the long run .

Sunday , July 26 , 2009 Legal immunity set for swine flu vaccine makers : What are the implications ? AP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe got a swine flu vaccine scoop -- yet the news is four weeks old . It turns out that DHHS Secretary Sibelius has not only given immunity to the makers of Tamiflu and Relenza for injuries stemming from their use against swine flu . She also granted immunity to future swine flu vaccines and `` any associated adjuvants , '' which was published in the June 25 , 2009 Federal Register . Here is the start of his story : The last time the government embarked on a major vaccine campaign against a new swine flu , thousands filed claims contending they suffered side effects from the shots . This time , the government has already taken steps to head that off . Vaccine makers and federal officials will be immune from lawsuits that result from any new swine flu vaccine , under a document signed by Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius , government health officials said Friday . Since the 1980s , the government has protected vaccine makers against lawsuits over the use of childhood vaccines . Instead , a federal court handles claims and decides who will be paid from a special fund . The document signed by Sebelius last month grants immunity to those making a swine flu vaccine , under the provisions of a 2006 law for public health emergencies . It allows for a compensation fund , if needed ... However , the compensation issue is more difficult than portrayed by Stobbe . The special vaccine court to which Stobbe refers applies only to specially designated vaccines , excludes most adult vaccines , and swine flu is not a designated vaccine for which compensation can be paid . The 2006 Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act ( PREPA ) allows the DHHS Secretary to invoke almost complete immunity from liability for manufacturers of vaccines and drugs used to combat a declared public health emergency . PREPA removes the right to a jury trial for persons injured by a covered vaccine , unless a plaintiff can provide clear evidence of willful misconduct that resulted in death or serious physical injury , and gets permission to sue from the DHHS Secretary . There has been no government funding of its potential compensation mechanism , to date . Furthermore , a PREPA declaration explicitly shields `` government program planners '' who arranged for the liability waiver . Pharmaceutical companies making swine flu vaccine today may have demanded immunity from liability before agreeing to begin a crash program to manufacture H1N1 vaccine for the government . According to a 1978 report by the National Academy of Sciences , something similar happened with the 1976 swine flu program : ... all manufacturers made plain that they would not insure themselves , not even temporarily . Instead they put off plans to bottle their vaccine ; pending legislation they would keep the stuff in bulk . Each weeks delay in moving from bulk to bottles assured at least as much delay in starting inoculations . Thus ended hopes of immunizing anybody in July or even August ... Behind Merrells firmness , there almost certainly was fear of the intentions of the casualty insurers . In May it was no secret that at least some major firms wanted to steer clear of swine vaccine . As early as April 8 Merck had been warned by its primary insurer that coverage for swine vaccine was considered not feasible at virtually any price. So Merck 's President had written Mathews and everyone else in sight . Merrell , then about to switch insurers ( for unrelated reasons ) is reported to have been told by its new one something of the same sort at about the same time . We do not know precisely what was made of this , where in Merrells management . We do know that the issue was reviewed again , in June , by the insurer with the same result , a no. But we assume that Merrells counsel knew in May what the insurer had already warned in April . However that may be , it shortly would turn out that all insurers saw the swine flu program much alike : not for them . Here is the problem : once the PREP Act is invoked to shield manufacturers from liability , the pharmaceutical firms have no financial incentive to make the safest product , and have a negative incentive to test it for safety . As long as they do not deliberately harm consumers of the product , they will not be liable for damages . Are you following this argument closely ? In order to avoid having prior knowledge of possible harm to users of the product , for which they could be found liable , it is in the manufacturers ' best interest to know as little as possible about adverse reactions caused by their product .

Correct decision ? I would say this woman ' s mental health was at risk . How devastating to carry a fetus to term and deliver a stillborn or a baby who dies relatively soon . I know , it happened to a friend . Cruel , cruel , cruel .
Another Opinion `` mental existence '' - meaning any rudimentary mind in the form of rudimentary thought , emotion , sense of self , perception of pain or other senses , etc . My assumption is the scientific assumption that our minds are determined by the functioning of the brain and by its state of development and health . Of course , one could argue the religious view of a soul external to our bodies determining at least part of our mental existence , but there is no evidence to support any such religious view - it is all taken on faith . Where abortion rights are concerned , separation of Church and state would not allow for women 's rights to be restricted based on a religious argument .
If you have a specific topic from any of those you 'd like to discuss I 'll be glad to talk it over with you .
I 'm very curious to see how many other pro-abortion advocates will chime in and defend this mothers morally corrupted attitude .

Do n't be silly . You claimed that you had done a detailed study ( with an open mind , no less ) of evolution . It turns out that you can not name a single book about evolution that you have read , much less taken an actual course . I do n't claim that you need to graduate from college . I do claim that it is stupid and dishonest to claim expertise that you do n't have and to claim to oppose what you do n't understand . I think that you should at least have the integrity to learn the basics before you comment . You have n't done that . That is true of several topics on which you post .

If the Chicago handgun ban were truly discriminatory then it likely would have been struck down under the equal protection clause- a part of 14th Amendment which you do n't seem to care if states such as Arizona violate in their attempt to deal with illegal immigration . Disarmed blacks may have been victimized by the KKK while state governments looked the other way during the late 19th Century but fast forward to 2010- now blacks are much more likely to victimized by other blacks than by racist whites . If the intent behind the Chicago handgun ban is truly racist then why allow blacks to own rifles ? I recently read that you can learn to shoot a rifle more accurately in one hour than you could shoot a handgun in a lifetime of practice . Areas such as D.C. and Chicago have large populations of blacks and some argue that restrictive gun laws help fight crime in such areas while others argue that it makes crime worse . It 's part of the modern gun control debate- a debate that I think true judicial conservatives would stay out of as Justice Stevens pointed out .
Why do Americans want so many guns ? What are you most afraid of ?
Amazing how regularly they shoot themselves in the foot is n't it ?
There are a few fictional works which addressed this possibility and brought up interesting points . One is Aldous Huxley 's book Brave New World . In it , people were grown in artificial wombs , not born , and they could be genetically designed . In the book , a high level official of this society mentions to the main character that an experiment had been tried in which all the people made were brilliant , athletic and beautiful - anyway , characteristics that we admire in people ( nothing was said about picking their moral character ) . They ended up killing each other in competition for the better jobs and for leadership since nobody was willing to play the subservient menial role . Therefore , this society purposely grew humans who were at different levels ( some very mentally deficient ) to supply a distributions of people who could fit the distribution of roles necessary for society . Therefore , on an individual level , I do n't have much of a problem with genetic engineering ( assuming that we really fully knew what we are doing , which is doubtful since many unforseen side effects could occur ) . However , on a societal level , it could be very problematic .

Ok , so you are aboard an airplane full of people heading to New York or any major city in the United States . Would you be comfortable knowing that someone who wants to crash the plane can legally bring a gun on board , thus making it easier for him to follow through with his plan ? Or would you rather make it more difficult for him to hijack the plane ? Your choice .

I go further , and affirm that bills of rights , in the sense and in the extent in which they are contended for , are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution , but would even be dangerous . They would contain various exceptions to powers which are not granted ; and on this very account , would afford a colourable pretext to claim more than were granted . For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do ? Why for instance , should it be said , that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained , when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed ? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power ; but it is evident that it would furnish , to men disposed to usurp , a plausible pretence for claiming that power . ''
[ size=7 ] [ size=7 ] Not many people close to me know my story but for once I 'm actually ready to share with other people . Maybe I can reach out and help somebody or help people see the reality . When I was 16 I was curious about sex because a couple of my friends had done it and I ( for some dumb reason ) wanted to see what it was like for myself ( peer pressure , I guess ) . So it happens that my period does n't come . I find out that during this most unpleasurable experience he decided to take the condom off . I knew I was pregnant . And I knew that my mom would kill me if she found out so I kept it to myself . After a few weeks my mom started to get bad feelings and confronted me , had me take a pregnancy test , and as I said was ready to kill me . She was ashamed and really did n't give me much of an option as to whether or not I wanted to keep the baby . I also knew deep down that I was not ready to have a baby nor did I have the financial means to take care of one ( unless I wanted to live off of welfare ) . The father was not going to play an active role in this baby 's life , as far as he was concerned this was all a big joke to him . So I went to the clinic ( passed through all the pro-life activists ) and had the procedure done . I was scared but you know , I knew it was the right thing to do . I 'm 27 now and still think back and ask myself if I have any regrets . I would have a child that would be around 11 years old . I wonder what kind if life the 2 of us would be living . I 'm married now and have 2 children that I love and adore . They have a good life . I 'm glad that I had that choice 11 years ago . A second chance to make it right .
Because Satan is a fallen angel . He had a chance to be with God , but he did n't take it . He could go back to God any time he wanted to , but he does n't want to . He has free will . God wo n't take that away , even though He can .

The NT was compiled in the late 4th Century AD , being criticised at the time for the overtly political choice of which texts were included as Canon and which were rejected to become the Apocrypha . Further it is now generally accepted that the text was altered at a later date to comply with OT prophesy . Like The Saxon Chronicles , King Arthur or Robin Hood there is too much romanticisation and mythologising to be certain of virtually anything in the text .

how can family values shift in a nation withint 10 years ? ? 10 years ago america would have never thought they wouldve needed to put Marriage Ammendments on the ballot let alone have less than 60 % of the people actually vote for it .

Its kinda like the germans after slow and steady progress of the nazi party changed the whole nation 's perspective on the jews . people that were against the nazi party 5 years prior found themselves turning jews into concentration camps . i see a similar progression beginning in america to the point that this comment itself will be bashed by those on here whose conscience has been seared to the point that they think 2 men being married is ok .

`` No . Probability arguments such as those Behe uses are pretty meaningless because there is no basis on which to calculate them . '' - i take it you have n't read the book ? `` All we can measure is average observed mutation rates in populations , which are commensurate with the speed of genetic diversification seen in primate lineages . In fact , such rates of diversification are used as the basis of the molecular clock to infer dates of separation of lineages when the fossil record is n't clear . '' -ok `` Behe does n't understand probability . If he were tossing coins , he 'd be absolutely astonished by the sequence of heads and tails he obtained , because each sequence is vastly improbable . '' - I think you are doing yourself a disservice by by such silly claims . If random mutations are `` random '' do n't you agree that the probablity of 2 mutations happening on the same gene at the same time is pretty low ? And that 2 mutations happening on the same gene at different times is lower than one mutation on the gene ? `` He 'd probably attribute that to ID , too . However , biological evolution is based on cumulative and dependent probabilities , not independent ones , which makes them difficult to calculate . The reason biologists do n't care much for Behe is that he 's demonstrated a lack of understanding of some pretty basic concepts in science . '' `` Since the probability is incalculable , then no . '' - So the theory that RM initiated the changes that led from from monkey to man is unfalsifiable ? `` We infer that mutations are random because directed mutations have n't been observed except under very limited circumstances . If some gene or DNA sequence undergoes a point mutation , who is to say it happened because of some random cosmic ray , or because the Creator decided in his infinite wisdom to suspend the laws of nature for that moment and poke molecules around ? The answer is no-one , because no-one can calculate the relevant probabilities . However , the Creator hypothesis is scientifically barren because it explains everything , and hence explains nothing at all . ''
So you see , it is much harder to believe in a fossil record and sediment deposit stratigraphy , than in a giant boat crammed to the gills full of elephants , octopus , and cacti . I hope I cleared this up for everyone . We have found fossils , but they are all fake . We have not found an ark .but it is real .
i think it is because you are too logical because with people things do'nt have to make sence
Of course they 're not the same thing , but you 're dodging the point- the mere fact that bad things happen does not disprove the ineffectiveness of laws that are intended to prevent those bad things from happening .

The Daily Telegraph is in the pocket of big business interests , it 's about as trustworthy on this as Exxon Mobil 's PR department . I can also quote from the information sheets on the website of the unit : `` The year 2005 was the second warmest on record , exceeded by 1998 '' So , in other words , the torygraph is manipulating statistics and talking out of their collective arses . They chose the two warmest years on record and tried to make something out of the fact that the warmest was before the second warmest .
And yet , for most pro-choice folk on these forums , this question really is meaningless . For , even when it is assumed by these folk that the embryo has rights , they nevertheless argue that abortion is still acceptable . Even you believe this Shooter .
SALT LAKE CITY & # 8212 ; A member of Salt Lake County 's SWAT team left an M4 assault rifle in front of someone 's home after leaving the scene of a standoff in the township of White City . Salt Lake County Sheriff 's Deputy Levi Hughes says the gun was left by a veteran member of the SWAT team who forgot the weapon in the grass while packing up gear after the standoff ended . A homeowner found the rifle in the front yard of a house a few hours later and notified authorities . Hughes says an officer on patrol stopped by the home and recognized the rifle as a weapon belonging to the SWAT team . Hughes says leaving the gun behind was an unacceptable , terrible mistake . Hughes says the officer will face disciplinary action , but probably wo n't be fired .

A British couple held hostage by pirates for more than three months have told of brutal treatment at the hand of their captors who they say are perilously close to killing them . In separate telephone interviews with CNN affiliate ITN , Paul and Rachel Chandler pleaded for help and spoke of their fears that they were just days away from death . An emotional Rachel Chandler also spoke of how she thought `` dying would actually be an easy way out '' and how she wanted to see her husband `` at least once before we die . '' The Chandlers were taken by pirates from their 38-foot yacht , the Lynn Rival , just days after setting sail from the Seychelles islands for Tanzania . Their captors initially demanded a ransom of $ 7 million , but the British government -- in line with longstanding policy -- has refused to pay . `` Please , please find a way of helping us because it really is a very desperate situation here , '' Rachel Chandler said in the latest interview , in which she said she had not seen her husband for two weeks since they were violently separated . `` I 've broken a tooth because I was hit on the head with something , probably the butt of a gun ... I do n't know ... and yes , so we have been physically attacked . '' Rachel Chandler , 55 , who along with her husband has been held for nearly 100 days , said the pirates had issued a new deadline . `` They 've just told me that if they do n't get the money within four or five days they 'll kill one of us . '' Audibly close to tears , she also asked for a message to be passed on to her husband . `` The message to him is hang on for me because I hope -- my biggest hope -- is that I shall see him at least once before we die . '' She added : `` It 's hard not to feel , well , dying would actually be an easy way out . It 's hard to explain but it is when you 're all on your own in this country and you 've no idea where you are and no idea when something might happen and whether I 'll see Paul again . It 's just very , very despairing '' In a separate telephone interview 24 hours earlier , Paul Chandler , 59 , described how they were separated and savagely beaten . `` We tried to stay together and they threw us to the ground and whipped us and beat Rachel with a rifle butt and I was dragged off , taken to a different location . `` I was allowed to telephone her about 12 days ago . Se said she was being tormented all the time and then she said she was giving up . They 've lost patience . They set a deadline of three or four days , if they do n't hear , then they say they will let us die . `` We 're held in solitary confinement effectively . You know it 's just [ like being ] treated as a captive animal . '' It was not clear under what conditions the captives , who have been in sporadic telephone and video contact with journalists , had been allowed telephone access . ITN said both conversations had been shared with the British Home Office and his family . Britain 's Foreign and Commonwealth Office 's official line on hostages says `` the government will not make substantive concession for hostage takers , including the payments of ransom . '' Pirates have been very active off the east coast of Africa in the past several years , operating out of lawless Somalia . Last week , pirates attempted to hijack an Indian crude oil vessel 105 nautical miles from Somalia , the EU 's anti-piracy naval force said . The pirates opened fire on the ship and were later arrested . Piracy on the high-seas reached a six-year high in 2009 , according to the International Maritime Bureau , which monitors shipping crimes .

Abortion targets a very specific group of human beings : unwanted , unborn children . Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide . The Convention defined genocide as any of a series of acts designed to `` destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group . '' The acts listed include among others , causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group , imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group or forcibly transferring children out of the group .

I think that you missed the point of the argument . VT is arguing that the low birth rate in the West is attributable to high abortion rates and the high birth rates amongst Arabs creates a numbers game in favor of the Arabs . Since they respect life ( their own , that is ) more than the West , their numbers are growing much quicker , while our lack of respect for human life is causing the gap to widen .

From memory we spent one or two classes on it . We talked about black moths became more common after pollution and how Larmack was dismissed because there is no way for say a giraffe parent to pass on the fact it was always stretching its neck to its offspring . This was hardly contraversial and the television teachs me far more anyway . How was evolution presented at your school .
Translation : `` Shut up , I 'm right ! '' That 's a bit of a sidestep . Abortion is not genocide because abortion is not destruction of a certain group of people based on race , religion , ethnicity , etc . There is no way to make a case for abortion being genocide without making capitol punishment qualify as genocide . Frankly , I think it 's easier to do the latter ( yet most pro-lifers are also pro-death penalty ) . If you want to make an argument , then make an argument . But do n't call abortion genocide ; that 's just dumb .

Any novel change/mutation in `` expression '' at the organismic level that can not be directly linked to a novel genetic mutation can only be EAM , aka Devo-Evo , ( that is , developmental evolution ) , a neo-lamarkian phenomenon . Why ? Because such a phenomenon nothing whatsoever to do with the darwinist , `` ToE '' , that is , that such novel trait changes/'expressions ' originate from -- `` Random Genetic Mutation '' , coincidentally expressed as some lucky organismic trait that `` Natural Selection '' does not eliminate before it is inherited by offspring . And there simply is no genetic mutation here . What it does show , empirically , are that organismic tyraits are not determined by genetic chemicals , but by the organism 's usage of those chemicals to its own purposes and advantage .

... . It was a reassuring message that Mr. Obama takes seriously his duty to safeguard womens lives and basic rights , including free speech and the choice of whether to bear a child . The gag rule was first imposed by President Ronald Reagan . It barred any health care provider receiving American family planning assistance from counseling women on abortion , engaging in political speech on abortion or providing abortions , even with its own money . ... . That seriously disrupted the best quality and most accessible family planning services in poor countries . It denied women access to desperately needed contraceptives , help in preventing H.I.V.-AIDS , and maternal care . Mr. Obamas executive order lifting the financing ban will mean fewer deaths from unsafe illegal abortions . Mr. Obamas stated intention to work with Congress to restore financing to the population fund also is a life-saving step . It ends the sorry exercise by which Mr. Bush repeatedly blocked money approved by Congress to advance poor womens reproductive health , reduce infant mortality , end sexual trafficking and prevent the spread of H.I.V . and AIDS . To justify this cruelty , the Bush administration perpetuated a bogus charge that the population fund has either stood by or helped with coerced abortions in China .
All sin undermines society , including illicit gay sex sin . Or have you forgotten Sodom and Gomorrah ? Coming to a San Francisco bath house near you .
Who was it that said `` Americans will tolerate anything so long as it does not disrupt traffic '' ? If it was simply a question of putting one abortion clinic out of operation , then yes , protesting wya from that clinic would be inappropriate . That is nto what we are talkling about here , though . They are protesting abortion as an institution . With that being the case , restricting their protest to that clinic would be inappropriate . I take it you found the pictures disturbing ? That is pretty much the point . People genberally have a lot of trouble getting their heads around things like abortion , war , etc.. I had a dinner party not long ago and invited an army buddy of mine who hapened to be in the area . After dinner , there was a `` loud conversation '' between my army buddy , a staunch conservative , and a guy who was pro bush ( which pretty much makes you automatically NOT a staunch conservative ) . They were arguing about the Iraq war . My army buddy , who just served a hitch in Iraq , pulled out a stack of photos when the guy started parroting the bush administrations line about helping the iraqi people . They were photos of civilians , mostly little kids , who were blown apart by US troops . My friend had taken them in Iraq , then mailed them while he was on leave because the US ARmy does NOT allow you to go home with pictures like that ( another of those new secret policies ) . The pro-war guy ran out the back door and puked on my lawn . When he came back in , I jokingly said `` so did he change your mind , Chuck '' . to which my buddy replied `` I think he just changed my entire life , political affiliations , and religon in 30 seconds '' . Someitmes that is what it takes for people to sit up and take notice , especially when you are talking deaths or body counts .

This does n't mean its the right thing to do but this is a flaw of democracy .
Ugh , the stupidity . I read the first chapter , here 's some good excerpts . It 's helpful if one understands evolution before one attempts to debunk it . That 's just a blatant lie . The vast majority of mutations are actually neutral . One word : archaeopteryx .
Now , who should we believe , the creator of the universe , or some scientist freaks who dont even believe in God ? Astronomers claim they can see galaxies so far away , their light must be even older than the earth for them to be visible . But the Bible proves thats impossible . When God created everything , he must have set the light from those galaxies already beaming towards the earth , j so that when he later gave us telescopes , wed have more stuff to look at ! Heh , heh , is God unbelievable or what ? Now if you think that isnt the work of a conscious , omnipotent being whose son on earth was Jesus Christ , you must be deluded or something .

The treaty requires countries to take a number of steps to reduce the illegal manufacture and trade in guns , ammunition and explosives . In addition to making illegal the unauthorized manufacture and exporting of firearms , the treaty calls for countries to adopt strict licensing requirements , mark firearms when they are made and imported to make them easier to trace , and establish a cooperative process for sharing information between national law-enforcement agencies investigating arms smuggling .
a coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena . and databed you should be ashamed to say rock solid while at the same time failing in every way to defend evolution from a `` crackpot '' and his insane catholic overlord .
They assume that as evolution progressed - lots of elements of life are no longer useful .
If I did n't have my religion I would probably be a humanist as well . What gets me is when people asume that people like myself are simple or have been brainwashed . But the reality is that the accusers are the narrow minded ones who 've been textbook ( old style ) brainwashed .
Most of the time one should be able to tell the sex of the baby by about 20 weeks and very often even at sixteen . Second trimester starts at 12 weeks . You cant get an abortion after determining the sex because its illegal . Where are you getting your data ?

If we think it 's Homer then for this book , that 's good enough . But not so with the Bible . There can be absolutely no kernel of uncertainty , which in ancient texts , ambiguity is unavoidable .
Some people attempt to explain unknown causes in nature by God 's direct intervention . This has been called , `` the God of the gaps . '' While God could certainly intervene in the natural process ( called a miracle ) , to make God responsible for common natural phenomena means that as each scientific discovery finds a natural explanation of what was previously attributed to God , the direct intervention of God becomes unnecessary . That is , as the gaps in knowledge become smaller , the God of these gaps becomes correspondingly smaller . People with this mentality see science as a threat to their faith . Obviously , were such a view held by the founders of modern science , there would have been no incentive to find answers to the natural phenomena . Understanding these natural phenomena as secondary causes , places God above them where increased ability to explain how they occur not only does not `` decrease '' God , but adds wonder to His creation .

How can there be a gap in a theory that does not discuss what that subject in which the gap resides ? Evolution is the study of the change in allele frequencies . Non-life does not have alleles . Therefore evolution can not address or study the origins of life as those do not have alleles . You can not have a gap in something you do not study . Your argument is like saying that subject X is a gap in accounting when subject X is clearly a marketing issue . For someone who criticizes those who study and accept evolution for not studying ID , you seem to be guilty of the same .
I 'm not sure I see the comparison ? Explain .
theft is done illegally in spite of the law as well , maybe we should legalize that . A very bad argument .
First of all any XXXXX who has hung out on the beach knows jellyfish [ and similiar creatures ] are not real prone to fossilization in the first place . Leave one on the beach for a couple hours and observe , I mean vote , on what happens to it .

Guns do n't kill people . They just make people want to kill .
It seems to me that theres a divide between Creationists and materialists ... ( well lots of them , actually ) . < snip > Thats why anytime a Christian points to any evidence such as the power of prayer , the mind , the mind/body connection , the placebo effect , consciousness , mental abilities , spirituality , or any other trait that can not be explained materialistically , its quickly asserted that these are not science.
Sina mostly followed instructions and smiled alluringly at men because she would have been beaten if men didnt choose her . But sometimes she was in such pain that she resisted , and then she said she would be dragged down to a torture chamber in the basement . Many of the brothels have these torture chambers ,  she said . They are underground because then the girls screams are muffled. As in many brothels , the torture of choice was electric shocks . Sina would be tied down , doused in water and then prodded with wires running from the 220-volt wall outlet . The jolt causes intense pain , sometimes evacuation of the bladder and bowel  and even unconsciousness .

3 . The Bible has at least 3 stories of how the universe began . That 's one sure tipoff that the Fundie interpretation is wrong .
I think this is unlikely under the current makeup of the Supreme Court . But that of course is the fear that many have , i.e. , that gay marriage would be imposed via judicial fiat ( whether at the state or federal level ) rather than through legislative means .
Preliminary figures indicate that , as a whole , law enforcement agencies throughout the Nation reported a decrease of 4.4 percent in the number of violent crimes ... .
This is n't my position . I 'm arguing that your attempts to demonize magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds is foolish . Furthermore , if no honest citizen needs a 15 round magazine , then no police officer needs them either . If we can reload them quickly enough for it to not matter , then the police can do it too .

Firstly , there are plenty of non-dictatorial countries with gun ownership in place . It 's this that you 'd have to look at , rather than look at features of already existing dictatorships - I bet all dictatorships banned murder , as well . Secondly , gun ownership would not prevent a dictatorship , just make it harder . If `` guns do n't kill people , people do '' , then surely `` gun control does n't cause dictatorships , people cause dictatorships '' ?
What about the translations ? Why are there differences in the translations ? There is a big difference in kill to murder .
`` Back in the Roman era , Mithraism was perhaps Christianity 's leading competitor for the hearts and minds of others . Today Mithraism is religiously a non-factor , but it still `` competes '' with Christianity , in another way : It is a leading candidate for the `` pagan copycat '' thesis crowd as a supposed source for Christianity . What has been the point of this diversion ? The point is to give the reader a warning , to be on the lookout any time a critic makes some claim about Mithraism somehow being a parallel to Christianity . Check their sources carefully . If , like Acharya S , they cite source material from the Cumont or pre-Cumont era , then chances are excellent that they are using material that is either greatly outdated , or else does not rely on sound scholarship ( i.e. , prior to Cumont ; works by the likes of King , Lajard , and Robertson ) . Furthermore , if they have asserted anything at all definitive about Mithraic belief , they are probably wrong about it , and certainly basing it on the conjectures of someone who is either not a Mithraic specialist ( which is what Freke and Gandy do in The Jesus Mysteries ) or else is badly outdated . Mithraic scholars , you see , do not hold a candle for the thesis that Christianity borrowed anything philosophically from Mithraism , and they do not see any evidence of such borrowing , with one major exception : `` The only domain in which we can ascertain in detail the extent to which Christianity imitated Mithraism is that of art . `` `` http : //tektonics.org/copycat/mithra.html Of course what I find even more disturbing than the errors of the copy-cat theorists , is the fact they seem to feel the constant need to single our Christianity for these sort of attacks . As if it has EVER worked to do so ( it 's nothing new ) , and as if it does n't reveal a deep-seated prejudice . There 's just no other logical reason for the obsession .
What great scientific discoveries will we make with it ?
Humans attempt to create new species , such as breeding donkey with horses to get mules and lions with tigers to get ligers , but these `` NEW '' species are almost always born sterile and unable to perpetuate themselves .

On the subject of analogies for genetic information , would `` computer language '' ( code ) be a better analogy ? Indeed mutation and evolution *could* be shown with computer viruses . Of course this would require some familiarity with computer code . http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language
the idea is correct . creation cant compete with evolution . wan na know why ? bcecause creation explains itself so well and has actual dates . evolution cant even begin to compare with it . creation is so easy to know .
Evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin said : we have a prior commitment to materialism . It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us to accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world , but , on the contrary , that we are forced by our priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations , no matter how counter-intuitive Moreover , that materialism is an absolute , for we can not allow a divine foot in the door.
NOBODY refused to treat her , the first hospital just flat out misdiagnosed her .
We talk a lot about media bias , but sometimes the mainstream media goes so far beyond what should be acceptable fair and balanced reporting as to call into question their integrity . Like every other gun banner , she apparently sees the solution to gun crimes as taking guns away from the people who did n't commit the crime in the first place . ABC did n't stop there . Yesterday morning on `` Good Morning America , '' reporter David Muir continued the agenda-based `` reporting '' by proffering Michael Wolkowitz , a board member of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence , as an expert on firearms without bothering to mention that he was basing his whole argument on propaganda . In neither segment did ABC present the opposing viewpoint , choosing instead to promote their own biased agenda , including promoting yet another anti-gun piece they are planning to air this Friday entitled , `` If I Only Had a Gun , '' which Sawyer noted included a segment highlighting that `` since there is an impulse to think if I had a gun I could protect myself and others , we have an experience we 'll conduct based on a real incident in which we show you what happens . '' I 'm sure that reenactment will be completely unbiased and realistic , right ?
Thiest : I believe in God ? What is God as best defined by you ? Describe the nature of God . What is it that you believe in ?
Sticking a pair of scisors in the back of a full-grown , half born , fetus ' head , with the doctor holding in his hands a fetus about to be born , is not just wrong in a Christian belief . YOu 're sick if you support it .
I believe Lucy was just another species of Ape , Monkey or Chimp that went extinct due to either a change in her ecosystem , environment or as part of the food chain by a more powerful animal of the period .

SS 's theory predicts that DNA is unpredictable since there is no requirement that some designer entity would be required to abide by some nebulous rule as to the form of DNA .
Nope not at all . Did you even read Genesis 1 and 2 ?
At first the christian church was small . Then , a little later , it grew and as it grew and spread , it changed a little . Then , a little later , it unified and was called the Catholic church . Then later , there was a split , The Great Schism , and the Pretestant church was born , and it allowed some different sects and orders and eventually denominations to emerge . Today , we see a very diverse and widespread variety of christian churches that vary with geography .
Sorry to just barg in but I believe in our forefathers and I realize not every one does but hey , they did start a country people . So if anyone disagrees that the signers did n't mean it as a individual right I 've got more proof then I know what to do with .
True - most abortions are not due serious health/life risks - and there is much room for debate as to what other situations are valid enough to warrant abortion or could be addressed in other ways ( my favorite method of decreasing abortion ) . However , the claim that all other abortions are carried out because women are partying or vain is vile , insulting , false and one of the worst examples of misogyny I have seen in a long , long while . ( Pity whatever fool of a woman ends up or ended up with you . ) Granted - this is typical of a lifer who really cares not a whit about women or children - only in maintaining their supposed moral superiority . There are lots of reasons women abort - you can help by trying to address them or you can generalize , trivialize and insult . One will actually help the women and potentially her baby - the other allows you to pat yourself on the back .
Job 26:7 He stretches out the north over empty space ; He hangs the earth on nothing . How did they know that the `` vapors '' of the earth rise to create moisture , that is seeded by lightning with nitrogen and then falls as rain to fertilze the soil ?
To apathy : Call me crazy , but I still do n't see any evolution in the peppered moths ! ! We had light and dark moths before the industrial revolution , we now still have light and dark moths . The only thing that has changed is the population ratio , assumably by *natural selection* . Natural selection is not proof of evolution by any means . Creationists recognise it and accept it as it goes in nicely with the creationary model . Natural selection is basically the death of a particular type of animal if they are unsuited to the environment . In a given environment ( e.g . a very cold region ) , some ( e.g . the long-haired dogs ) will be more likely to survive , and so pass on their information , than others . Natural selection can favour some sets of information above others , and can eliminate some of the existing information in the population , but it ca n't create any new information . An example , consider the cold environment mentioned above . We take a population of both long , short and medium , haired dogs to this environment . Over time , very short time , the population will only consist of the long haired dogs as the short and medium haired dogs would freeze and be wiped out by the cold conditions . So , as a result , the population as a whole has lost the information for making short haired dogs and has not gained any new information . What did we have when we first took the dogs to the environment ? Dogs ( varying in hair sizes ) . What did we get after a short amount of time ? Dogs ( only the long hair size ) . There is no evolution occuring here , we had dogs before , dogs after . The only difference is that the gene for making short hair has been eradicated from the population by natural selection -- that is it . This is the essense of natural selection - and goes in nicely with the Biblical account of our origins , i.e . variation within a kind and that kind 's have the ability to only lose information - not gain it . So even if the peppered moth case was really true , and not a fraud , it still would not be evidence for evolution as opposed to creation . Anyone who says other wise , does not really know what they are talking about unless new genetic information is somehow being added to the moth 's total DNA content , i.e . their genome , in which case you might have a point . Would any creationists like to challenge anything about this article or the concept ? His method appears to be good , i.e . using observations and experimental data , as well as repeatability . He is using the scientific method ( in reverse as he is collecting the observations and experimental data and then will draw a conclusion based on the evidence and possibly his own bias . This is yet to be determined , however . Can you keep us informed of his progress ?
There has been a decrease in diversity ( probably due to global catastrophes ) . This is the reverse of what evolutionary theory predicts.38

You 're saying it 's impossible to take marriage out of the government ? Give all people currently married a civil union , and let people from now on get a civil union from the government , and marriage from the church . It really would n't be that hard .
Many on the religious right claim a belief in the existence of Satan and blame him for many of the evils in this world . I am curious why people believe that Satan is responsible for those evils , not men and their weaknesses . If you believe that Satan exists , can you give a specific example of some human event where you think he had to have played a role ?
You claim that the distinction between a baby being a bodily function of a woman or not is a matter of empirical fact , this is just not so . I think you should rethink what empirical fact is . Empirical fact , are facts that are said to be true on the basis of empirical observation . If I see a light on in a room , that is an empirical observation , and for me , that the light is on , is an empirical fact . However , if you and I both empirically observe at a fetus in a womb then the only empirical fact we could both agree on , I think , is that there is indeed a fetus in a womb . I say that fetus is part of a persons body performing a function , you say its something else , and thats a mater if ideology , not mere observation .
Actually , Simone , if you spend more time on their website and research a little deeper , you will find that they are also `` right wing wingnuts '' but they happen to want `` sensible '' gun policies in order to eliminate violence ( clearly delineated from war ) with the use of guns in all countries . Essentially they are the ones you are griping about and stereotyping . Provide a decent basis of argument besides a stereotype please .
The bahavior is only `` morally corrupted '' if there is , in fact , something wrong with what they did . I do n't see it .
At least I & # 8217 ; m not advocating hauling astronomy to court and getting it thrown out of significant parts of the public realm . Do you think they & # 8217 ; re all genuinely mystified that someone would suggest that other branches of science be held to the same criteria that evolutionists have set for ID ?
After all , when I tried to engage marc in a discussion totally independent of evolution -- morality -- he ran .
I believe in the teachings of Jesus .
I thought I got to the substance of your argument quite well , and prefer not to drone on with a million quotes . If you want to press your argument further you will need to construct an argument as to why `` putting someone in the position '' obligates you to sustain their life , and when doing so you may want to examine the consequences of that position , to see if you can apply it consistently . You put it there therefore you are responsible for it is n't , in itself , an argument .
It becomes more and more clear why atheists are comfortable with theistic evolution . If there was no Adam , there was no original sin , and no genealogy as described in the book of Genesis , only monkeys . Except for his amazing exception to science in the virgin birth of Jesus , he seems to allow evolutionistic pronouncements to have priority over Biblical statements . Then ALL the basics of Christianity , the nature of God and central New Testament teachings , including the way the sinner Adam ( one man ) and the Savior Jesus ( one man ) are linked together in Romans 5 , 16-18 , are trivialized just the way atheists love . No wonder they 're so comfortable with theistic evolution !

I thought that crocodiles and alligators were in about the same state as they were millions of years ago and that was because thier habitat did not require them to change therefore the odd slight mutations that gain the advantage and lead to change was of no advantage .

The problem is that a lot of people feel that there has been a concerted effort for a long time now to get homosexuality in the face of people as much as possible . How many children 's books are about two people falling in love , period ( regardless of gay or straight ) ? I 've got children and we run across a LOT of books . Few are about that . Now young adult books are a different story . But not children 's books . So if these children 's books are about gay people falling in love , they were written that way on purpose . So my question is , why ca n't gay people just write honest children 's books with NO agenda ? If these books have gay relationships in them , and they are children 's books , then there is every reason to believe they were written that way as an agenda . And I 'd say for a book titled Heather Has Two Moms , an agenda is pretty obvious . Sheesh , whatever happened to good 'ol Dr. Seuss ?
If the Senate does agree to the legislation , Connecticut becomes the first state to voluntarily establish civil unions .

Wow , I just have to say that Sinjin , Trebor , And Colonel , have shown me what a fool I have been for believing in God , and trying to live my life as a good and God fearing person , I guess now since there really is no God , I can just act like some kind of hate mongering heathen with nothing to fear from a higher power who says not to act like that ( heathen ) . Man if we had leaders like you , and our kids were taught to believe as you three do , our society would be so much better off . We would have more crime , less morality , churches could shut down and not help strugling people with things like food and bills , we would be able to remove `` In God we Trust '' from our money and replace it with `` We dont trust or believe in squat '' . And by the way , if God is not real as you have plainly made me see , why is Gods name on our money , why is Gods name in our pledge of allegiance , why have people believed in God and the bible since before you and I were ever thought of , before your fancy psychology was ever thought of , for that matter why do we have AD and a Bc eras . I once heard on the news that Nohas Ark had been found , but hoe is that possible . I guess I will just keep on being the fool that yall think I am by believing in God , I am a lot better off in many ways .

Do n't you dare try and give me a lecture about cherry picking ! All you ever do is cherry pick ! You come around about once a month , scour the news to find a crime committed with a gun , and you use that single incident as if it 's evidence that there 's a serious problem that threatens the entire nation . If that 's not cherry picking then I do n't know what is . As a gun owner I 'm also a property owner . Or are you denying that guns are property ?

Dont expect the recent retractions and exonerations to change that . One of the strongest , most-repeated findings in the psychology of belief is that once people have been told X , especially if X is shocking , if they are later told , No , we were wrong about X ,  most people still believe X . As Twain and Churchill knew , sometimes the truth never catches up with the lie , let alone overtakes it . As I wrote last summer in a story about why people believe lies even when theyre later told the truth , sometimes peoples mental processes simply go off the rails .

As many polls have shown , the more educated a person becomes , the less likely it is that he/she is a creationist .
5 , By L. LEWIS WALL MOTHERHOOD is a blessing , but in many parts of the world childbirth leaves women permanently injured and turns them into social outcasts . In West Africa , only about 1 percent of pregnant women have Caesarean deliveries because the procedure isnt widely available . When labor is obstructed , the baby is trapped in the pelvis , and labor can last up to a week . Women who survive this ordeal can develop a hole in the bladder called a fistula . This injury  caused by the prolonged pressure of the babys head on the soft tissues of the pelvis  causes continuous and uncontrollable loss of urine . The millions of women in Africa and Asia who suffer from fistulas are often shunned by their communities for the rest of their lives . In Liberia , I operated on a woman who had endured a fistula for 35 years , and it took only 20 minutes to repair her injury . Including a month of hospital care and the surgical supplies needed , the operation costs about $ 300 to $ 450 . All a clinic needs is spinal anesthesia , intravenous fluids , basic surgical instruments , sutures and a catheter for draining urine . Its even easier to prevent these injuries from happening in the first place . With supervision , local village labor monitors can learn to track the progress of a birth and send the woman to a hospital when labor lasts too long . Trained birth attendants can detect abnormalities in labor by using a partograph  a simple graph that charts the progress of labor and tells attendants when to intervene . The World Health Organization tested the partograph in 35,000 births in Southeast Asia and found that using it cut the number of prolonged labors almost by half . Widespread use of this simple early warning system would go a long way toward saving babies and mothers lives  and making fistulas a thing of the past .
A second chance to make it right .
The `` Big Bang '' theory is just a story that somebody made up ...
In the first trimester there is no consciousness and no possibility of pain . This method is safe for the woman .
Why are you blaming me ? What did I do ? How can you stop it from happening ? You are good at flaming rhetoric but apparently you do n't have an actual clue on what you are asking . You want us all in the exact same position as Ms. Ross ! Peaceful , compliant victims of vicious predators ! By the way , did you see this ? If you had your way , I would be dead too ! Na ! I think I will keep my rights , and you can keep your pipe dreams of a violence free society !
For those who are pro-life , how much of a role does your belief in a soul ( assuming you hold such beliefs ) play into your views on abortion ? To explore this , would your views on a particular abortion change if you knew for certain that a particular fetus has no soul ? The reason I bring this up is that , for those of us with largely secular views , the idea of the soul is closely analogous to our idea of mental existence , sentience , etc . I suspect , therefore , that much of our thinking may end up being similar but that you view this mental essence as starting at conception and we take the scientific view of it happenning much later in a pregnancy . I know that , apart from that arguement , you value potential more than we do . However , I suspect that concepts of the soul do play a role in the views of most on the pro-life side . Would you be willing to discuss such ideas ?
3 . The scientific effect involved is always at the very limit of detection .
It predicts that man has always been intelligent and ancient language and buildings confirm this .
Exactly . Also , `` traditional '' marriage was adopted from pagan ceremonies that allowed same-sex couples to be wed along with hererosexual couples . Either way , his traditional marriage statements are flawed greatly .
Many contemporary authors prominent in bioethical circles distinguish sharply between being a human being and being a human person . These authors claim that for an entity to be regarded as a person , it must have developed at least incipiently exercisable cognitive capacities or abilities ... ..

YEC really si n't an issue here .
My life was a gift from my parents , no more , no less . When i look in the mirror , i do not see an embryo . If someone gives you something , they have every right to take it away if they feel you are not suited to handle it , or if they had second thoughts . I would think this was ok if the baby was stopped in an earlier stage , but once its in its third trimester , you have no right to kill it .
Wow , what a group of rude , self important , pompous , pseudo intellectuals who will insult and personally attack a person for one grammatical error . I meant to say the UNIVERSE has aged from 4 to 14 billion years old since I was in school but rather than deduce that you call me dumb and ignorant ? With all of your so called intelligence can you prove the Universe is now precisely 14 billion years old ? Can you prove Neanderthal Man was a human descendant ? because DNA tests dont prove that out and yet PHDs and Masters Degreed scientists insist they are . That 's why the bible say 's that the wisdom of this World is foolishness to God .
then why ca n't a man opt out of fatherhood when a mass of tissue is just that a mass a tissue .
`` Abortion on demand and without apology '' was the mantra of the pro-abortion crowd at the 1992 Spring of Life rally here in Buffalo , NY .
Then be troubled because ID is clearly creationism . For example , an early draft of `` Pandas and People '' stated : `` Creation is the theory that various forms of life began abruptly , with their distinctive features already intact : Fish with fins and scales , birds with feathers and wings , mammals with fur and mammary glands . '' After attempts by `` creation science '' to get religion taught as science failed in the courts , the text was altered . The published text reads : `` Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency , with their distinctive features already intact : Fish with fins and scales , birds with feathers , beaks and wings , mammals with fur and mammary glands . '' And yet you are n't troubled by the fact that these two non-synonymous ideas can both be explained merely by exchanging either `` creation '' or `` intelligent design '' and `` God '' or `` intelligent designer . '' And , of course , there is the view of Judge Jones of the Dover , PA trial who stated in his decision , `` The evidence at trial demonstrates that ID is nothing less than the progeny of creationism '' and `` The overwhelming evidence at trial established that ID is a religious view , a mere re-labeling of creationism , and not a scientific theory . '' Oh , let 's see . How about the fact that both ideas rely on some magical invisible being that brought everything about by some unspecified means . What is funny is that for public consumption ID claims that the identity of the designer is unknown ( wink , wink ) . However , as is stated in the Discovery Institute 's private Wedge document , one of the goals of ID creationism is : `` To replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and hurnan [ sic ] beings are created by God . '' That sounds like creationism to me .
Bingo . This is spot on . Why suggest a repeal of the entirety of DOMA if you support the policy established by part of DOMA ? And I repeat my earlier observation : if DOMA is such a travesty , why not go ahead and try to repeal it as a Senator . Such a repeal would have to be initiated by Congress anyway . It 's highly unlikely that he could accomplish a repeal of DOMA as President .
How can we test it ?
Yes , thanks to todays science , the study of individual , whole organisms has been replaced by the study of genes . Instead of real-life representing bilogical reality , theyve created their own fairytale of biolgical reality . The fact is , genes make sense only in the context of the organism  and the organism only makes sense only within the context of the environment they live in . Animals , in fact , seemed to have completely disappeared from the realm of evolutionary biology . Nobody talks about animals anymore ... and they certainly do n't talk about how they interact with their environment .
Whats the difference ?
Surely you understand that this is not the same as providing evidence for creationism . Disproving one theory does not prove another . All it does is disprove a theory .
What would you consider as constituting the soul if it does not include our personalities ? As for god , I agree that the existence of god is not disproven but the discoveries of Science have very much limited the detailed roles that were originally ascribed to him . What , then , is left for the role of god ? What `` evidence '' is there for God ? Are you speaking of people 's personal experiences ? I always wondered what specifically in those experiences made people think that they were experiencing God - where they thought that no other explanations could be valid . I agree that one can always think of ways to claim that scientific evidence of , say , Evolution was purposely planted by God as a test of mankind , and other such explanations . If one assumes an omnipotent God , then ANY evidence or logic can be discarded . It just seems that many of those who discard scientific findings jump through tremendous hoops to avoid addressing the evidence .
What is a Christian agnostic ? ( Never heard of them . )
All I 'm saying is that it is a lot larger leap , based on common sense , to say `` The Universe began when an uncreated atom exploded causing a chain reaction that eventually lead to the creation of all in the Universe through mere happenstance ...
Same number of grains of sand , same number of blades of grass , same number of humans who look exactly like each one of us , doing exactly the same things at exactly the same times .

One can live off the other ... and if so do you kill the non-dominant one . They did n't say anything in this video but one is more dominant than the other normally . Does the dominant one have the right to kill the other for living off of them ? Can one girl kill herself or do harmful things to her body if she chooses ... even against the other heads will ? So many questions and since the pro-choice stance is ever complex I figure this would be an interesting response .

Actually , society has n't said this . 5 judges , in very recent times , have . I for one think that some 17 year olds fully comprehend the full implications of murder , and therefore should be held accountable in the same way as an 18 year old .

which can quickly alter shape , color , size , structure , and behaviors of animals ?
Creationism starts with a conclusion , and finds data to support it . According to the scientific method , one is suppose to look at data , and draw a conclusion from it . Therefore , creationism is not science , and needs not take any scientific consideration . The end .

You 'll have to ask gnojek that . It appears he thinks that any pronouncement by a scientist suggesting CO2 production is a problem is a conspiracy theory by scientists to get bigger budgets : `` As scientists we will tell you that there is a major problem that can only be solved through science , which can only be done with money . We 're scientists and we really like grant money to do research . Would n't it be great if we had a global initiative to fund this research indefinitely , or until the global warming problem is solved ... '' It 's the YEC movement all over again : there 's no proof , the evidence could be interpreted either way , it 's a scientific conspiracy theory , the Devil is behind it : it 's un-Christian to cut back on fossil fuel burning etc
Yes it is patent that you would assume that . Your wish to advertise this and tell the world , repeatedly must make you of some import . Repeatedly you make this a personal issue . I have addressed posts and say 'another poster has said ... such and such ' . But you insist that I address YOU in such posts . Now you are going at it again , saying I 'm not answering questions . This is an attempt to take the moral high-ground , and is itself highly deceitful , especially in light that you have in the past accused me of saying things that I did n't ... see our discussions re : Archie , the transitional bird-beast . Also , you name-call , and then chuck a tantrum if anyone does the same back . I must say here that I do wish you 'd stop personalising this , as it only leads to more confrontation , not discussion . Calling people names is just grand-standing . It is the sort of behaviour that suggests someone who is just interested in making themselves heard , regardless of anyone else .

Because naturally the man should be responsible to pay for it ... one way or another , to support it ... and her in marraige , or provide child support , as provided in the law ... he did the deed , and must be made to pay..

Steeeeve , ALABAMA voted out `` miscegenation '' in 2000 `` by act of legislature '' . http : //www.usatoday.com/news/vote2000/al/main03.htm Loving v Virginia ruled Alabama 's law as unconstitutional over 30 years prior . The truth is that when the court notes that a law is unconstitutional , the law becomes unenforceable . The COURT does not remove the law from the books . The legislature must accomplish that act by its actions . But the action of the court , invalidating the law , PRECEDES the action of the legislature ... I am asking about states where the legislature , without having the courts already striking down the law , took it upon themselves to remove the miscegenation law all by themselves . That is the point .
EveryTown , USA - - ( AmmoLand.com ) - In just 3 months Americans bought enough guns to outfit the entire Chinese and Indian armys combined .

This is an evaluation of overall firearms and ammunition purchases based on low end numbers per Federal NIC instacheck data base Statistics . The numbers presented are only PART of the overall numbers of arms and ammunition that have been sold . The actual numbers are much higher .
Really ? ? ? You think most people would incorporate the golden rule ? I do n't think so -- I think most people are willing to make a buck off of others ( business ventures ) , land that job they want before someone else gets it , curse someone for cutting them off in traffic , get that parking spot before the guy coming around the corner gets it , or even get in an intentionally insulting dig to someone in a discussion forum such as this . The examples could go on and on ... I think a lot of people like to THINK they incorporate the golden rule , but at close , honest examination would find that they rarely do .
And then there 's the fact that registration databases are nothing more than money pits that serve no crime fighting benefits , Canada has stated such .

Oh and then we come to the fact that criminals will never register their weapons , leaving them untraceable !

Wow marc . You spent some time thinking about this video . Just a question for you - hypothetical What would happen if we took a bunch of people , stuck them on a planet with no access to any knowledge of God or Christ - and say we left them there for a couple hundred thousand years . Are they more likely to come to the conclusion that Genesis 1 & amp ; 2 happened , some other random story of religious creation , or something a little closer to what scientists have come up with ? Be honest !
As unlikely an excuse as there could ever be . In most other places around the country , federal standards are more than sufficient for the job . Federal standards on imitation and toy firearms dictate a blaze orange muzzle/barrel to immediately alert everyone that it 's just a toy . Just about every other location in America has no problem with this being the standard . If New York City is worried about kids accidentally getting shot , because their officers simply ca n't tell the difference between a squirt gun and a real gun , then should n't they instead be looking into better training methods for their officers to teach them better control ? If the police currently employed by NYC ca n't tell the difference between a real gun and a toy gun like what you can get at Wal-Mart in the kid 's section , then they 've got no business being police in the first place .
As you noted , Supersport 's theory predicts DNA from extinct species to be the same as modern DNA .

Obviously the question every debate on abortion boils down to is when does one get the right to live , so I 'd like to use this thread as a debate on that subject . Since I 'm mainly concerned with whether abortion is legal or not , I 'd appreciate it if religion was kept out of the debate . So the questions are : a ) What creatures have the right to live ? b ) When do these creatures get the right to live ? c ) Why do these creatures have the right to live at the time you give for question b . Please answer all questions rather than just one since all three are essential to the debate .

Well , there is a new discovery on the block . This time , evolutionary psychologist David Buss , from the University of Texas , argues that murder is also an adaptation . Murder could be traced back to the ruthless evolutionary drive to reproduce , he said . Thousands of years ago killing an enemy would boost a mans social status and improve his chances of attracting a mate , the book argued . Murderers genes won the evolutionary battle over those of their victims and the instinct to kill now lies dormant in all of us , Prof Buss argued . I dont want to comment on Busss argument as I have not read the book . Nevertheless , since it is so easy to create a new field of scientific exploration about human behavior using Darwins theory , I am inspired to try my hand at it .
Now what was a fossil cow skull doing in a place like this  an area rich in dinosaur bone more than 100 million years old ?

That is one definition of creation . There are many . You again make a mistake of making an assumption about what you want to argue about , and argue against that . If you want a ( non-exhaustive list ) see http : //www.crystalinks.com/creation.html You have simply picked one model , treated it as the only one , and constructed a ( thus false ) argument against it .
Actually , society has n't said this . 5 judges , in very recent times , have . I for one think that some 17 year olds fully comprehend the full implications of murder , and therefore should be held accountable in the same way as an 18 year old . I guess I just do n't see any reason why a jury could not address the issue on a case by case basis . I do not see the `` 18 and over execution rule '' in the eighth amendment . The point about abortion that I brought up is that it questions the premise offered by thelmoose with respect to juvenile development . In fact , this point was made in the dissent of a Supreme Court opinion dealing with executing juvenile offenders . On the one hand , it is argued that juveniles do posses enough moral maturity to be able to have the same right to abortion as an adult , but on the other hand , it is argued that they do not posses enough moral maturity to be able to be held to the same standard as adults when it comes to the decision to commit cold blooded murder . For your convenience , I underlined the key parts . We have here two contradictory statements . That is what I was pointing out .
Irreducible complexity proves this is incorrect ,
My point is , people are prepared to admit that the creation story , and the story of noahs arc are metaphors . They read them , and then look at the evidence to hand and say `` Well , it ca n't be really true the way it is written , so it must mean this ... '' But the bias of the church against homosexuality is based of a small passage of text which , it seems , can not be interpreted away . That part that condemns homosexuality is accurate , straight-from-gods-mouth truth . Again , why the dichotomy ? Why are some parts of the bible open to interpretation , but others are rigid ? .
Pro choicers claim they are for the rights of women . If that is true why do n't pro-choicer want the pregnant women who seek abortion to be informed . I read yesterday , how the pro-choice people are trying to block legislation that would help women make better CHOICES about their pregnancy . If I find the link , I 'll post it , but the legislation was anyone who seeks an abortion , must have access to a sonogram before the abortion . That having an abortion `` may '' cause post-abortion stress syndrome , which for some it does ! It 's sad , pro-choicer , do n't want women to be `` informed '' to the best of their ability . Sonogram can be helpful tool to the WOMAN in helping her make a better CHOICE , and are n't pro-choicers all about CHOICE . So why block this legislation ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? I do n't understand why pro-choicers have so much hate .
Nice emotional argument , but unfortunately , lacking in fact . The chances of pregnancy as a result of rape are extremely small . Lots of research is available should you doubt the veracity of my statement .
Well , as the Christain Zealots say , `` Eve ate the apple '' .
I have common sense and I use it .
who knows but recent studies do show an increase in depression/substance abuse ( and things of that nature ) after abortions ... a study came out in January suggesting this might be the case but the study did not that more research needs to be done on the subject .

That 's horrible . That 's part of why I 'm for abortion , the result of making it illegal .

So again , I do n't want to know the things you can disprove or philosophize about . I want to see the evidence . Given that , you will surely begin to change my mind .

The memo is real , nobody has ever been able to disprove it . Handgun Control Inc. ( the people who later became the Brady Campaign ) have claimed that the memo is a hoax and that what was released has never been their official position . However them simply stating this , is no different than Obama making a statement on national news , and then several months later saying `` I never said that '' and trying to reverse his position . Until it can be proven beyond doubt as being untrue and simple propaganda , the memo is real and explains in detail exactly what the gun control groups are after .

Article : http : //reuters.myway.com/article/200 ... ORTION-DC.html . As I foreshadowed in this thread and this thread , South Dakota has passed a ban on abortion . According to the articla , the South Dakota law punishes those who perform an abortion with a 5 year prison sentence and a $ 5,000 fine . There is a life exception as I understand it .
The difference then could be construed as pro-life being in favour of all forms of life , no matter how degraded , and pro-choice being in favour of a particular minimum quality of life .
I 'm saying that given ADEQUATE EVIDENCE , science , IN PRINCIPLE , can answer all questions concerning the MATERIAL world . That is actually quite a limited statement if you bother to read it carefully .

This Pauline gospel of a dying and rising savior bore unmistakable similarity to many of the Greek and Roman mystery cults which had similar stories . Pauls description of the eucharist as a Christian mystery lent further support to this view . But there were notable differences as well . ( Paths of Faith : Fourth Edition , John A. Hutchinson , McGraw-Hill , 1991 , p417 )
Interestingly enough one of those above also states ... 1. artificial selection Definition : The selective breeding by humans towards a desired trait in a plant , animal , or other organism which is of value ( usually economic ) to the humans . The process operates on the same principles as natural selection . But man has a purposeful process . This would mean 'nature ' also has purpose in it 's 'selection ' process .

Pregnancy is n't expensive at all unless you 're conned into thinking it has to be . If it were , poor people could n't have the kids they do . Medical costs can be paid for by others . It 's the luxuries many yuppy types seem to think they need that makes the after effects costly . In most cases of putting a pregnancy up for adoption , there is NO cost incurred to the mother .
You need n't be far left to support reasonable gun regulation . What current firearm related issue would drive an `` anti-gunner '' to commit a terrorist act ?

I ca n't judge women who decide their fetus is not a person at the time of abortion . I do know that first trimester is a `` no-brainer '' for me as far as the legality for abortion . Second trimester is probably okay and the third is not in my view . However , the third trimester should not be a deterent if the health of the mother is at issue . She 's most important or the rest of the family will not survive .
Besides , I 'm not discussing personal morality here , I 'm discussing what should be legal , and what is practical in a society where not everyone shares the same moral views .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- A U.S. judge Thursday became the second in the nation to rule that a federal ban on a particular type of late-term abortion is unconstitutional . In his ruling on the law dubbed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act , Judge Richard Conway Casey cited a high court ruling and a lack of exemption to protect the health of a woman . `` The Supreme Court ... informed us that this gruesome procedure may be outlawed only if there exists in medical consensus that there is no circumstance in which any woman could potentially benefit from it , '' Casey wrote in his ruling . `` A division of medical opinion exists , '' Casey wrote . `` Such a division means that the constitution requires a health exception . '' The plaintiffs in the suit -- seven physicians who perform abortions and the National Abortion Federation -- were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union . `` We 're quite pleased that the court recognized that this ban brought an attack on second-trimester abortions as early as 13 weeks in pregnancy , '' Lorraine Kenny , a spokeswoman for the ACLU , told CNN . The ban included no health exception and therefore would endanger women 's health , Kenny said . Planned Parenthood also applauded the decision . `` The abortion ban is a brazen affront to women 's health , the right to medical privacy and the U.S. Constitution and was rightfully struck down , '' Planned Parenthood President Gloria Feldt said in a statement released by the group . `` This ruling is a critical step toward ensuring that women and doctors -- not politicians -- can make private , personal health care decisions , '' Feldt added . The National Right to Life Committee came out against the judge 's decision . `` Judge Casey said his ruling was dictated by a 5 to 4 Supreme Court ruling in 2000 , which held that Roe v. Wade protects partial-birth abortion , '' said Douglas Johnson , legislative director for the NRLC , in a statement . `` Future appointments to the Supreme Court will determine whether it remains legal to mostly deliver living premature infants and painfully puncture their skulls , '' he said . Penalties and procedures A federal judge in San Francisco previously ruled the act unconstitutional , and a U.S. court in Nebraska is to rule on another case by August 31 . The law would have imposed criminal and civil penalties on `` [ a ] ny physician who , in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce , knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion . '' The law affects abortions carried out late in the typical 40-week pregnancy , but before the fetus is considered viable . Such primarily second-trimester abortions usually involve a procedure known to doctors as `` dilation and extraction , '' but referred to by opponents as `` partial-birth abortion . '' During the procedure , the fetus is partially removed and its skull collapsed . Most medical organizations opposed the law . In the San Francisco ruling , Judge Phyllis Hamilton wrote that the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology expressed the belief that there are circumstances in which partial-birth abortion `` may be the most appropriate and safest procedure to save the life or health of a woman . '' The federal government contends that it is never necessary , refuting the Supreme Court 's rejection of a Nebraska law in a 2000 decision . Since 1995 , state bans against late-term abortions have been enacted in more than half the states . They have been challenged in courts throughout the country . The ACLU says courts considering these laws -- including the U.S. Supreme Court just three years ago -- have consistently struck down the bans because they do not take into account risks to the woman 's health .

They are utterly nonproductive , they waste health care dollars , they do not begin to adequately provide health care . Truth be told , health insurance companies do more to prevent health care than they cause heath care to occur . Profit and greed and enormous CEO salaries and excessive CEO bonuses are the only reasons for being of health insurance companies . Those who are insured by health insurance companies are almost always totally screwed . They pay and pay premiums and get very little in return .
Of course they do .
You keep bringing up the Red Cross . The majority of donators to the Red Cross are most likely Christians as well , so what 's your point ?

let me try to translate into words 1. if there is a god in this world , there is a god in all worlds 2. there being a god is a possibility 3 . If there 's a god in all worlds , there 's a god in this one 4 . There not being a god in all worlds implies that there 's is n't a god in any world ( all or nothing ) 5 . There is either a god in all worlds or there is n't a god in all worlds 6. from 4,5 there either is a god in all worlds or no god in any world 7. if there 's no god in this world then there 's not a god in all worlds 8 . There 's either a god in all worlds or there is no god in any world . 9 . Since god is a possibility we know the statement < there is no god in any world > is false . 10 . Since there 's a god in all worlds there 's a god in this one from 3 Is this the right interpretation ? If it is there is one flaw in it . # 9 is flawed . Just because there 's a possibility of a god does n't mean that there is a god in some world , just that there 's a possibility of him being in some world .
A facinating way of framing it I should say . I could simply reply that pregnancy is preventable , that it is not a permanent condition and if one is patient it will end with the child 's birth . I could also point out that the fetus is not responsible for the pregnancy in that it did not decide on it 's own to come into existence and plant itself in the mother 's womb but rather it was the mother and father that made the child through their actions so why is it made to pay the ultimate price ?
How about a sin tax of $ 100 each time you buy a gun and $ 10 each time you buy a bullet ? Its fair because it would help pay for all the damage guns do to society . Rights come with responsibilities .
All of the British papers keep going on about how bad it is , how more people than ever are being gunned down in the streets , how guns are being imported into Britain and resold through underground channels , how criminals employ young women to act as gun mules for transporting and storage , etc .

Right now , the majority of Americans DO believe that gay marriage IS wrong . This has been demonstrated in 19 states that overwhelmingly voted against gay marriage .

Congrats , may your marriage continue to be a happy one . If I may deviate from the original thread a bit I have a couple of questions that pertain to your specific situation . If they are too personnal please feel free to say so . Do you consider yourself to be any particular branch of Christian ? ie . Lutheran , Catholic , Apiscopal ( sp ) , etc . How do you reconcile your Christianity with the portions of the bible that specificly deal with homosexual activity as a sin ? ( If this question sounds rude please excuse me , I could n't think of a better wording . ) Thanks
The dino would be to heavy to glide or fly with them if they were n't fully developed , and even then only a few yards could be gained when jumping off a hill , ect , and when not fully ready . the would hinder the dino by hunting , by giving it a larger profile , and something else to get wounded for no benefits in return .
You did n't answer her question , nor did you address her point . You simply sidestepped them because they make your argument look as stupid as it really is .
Then you would have to be believe that out of the supposed millions upon millions of people who walked the Earth none of them were pregnant and there were no newborns either . Then again , to be Christian , you also have to believe the world was created in 7 days and their was a Biblical great flood too . The best part about writing a fairytale is that the author gets to make up everything as they go along .

My opinion is that it is an excuse to sin .
That much can be said . But we can provide evidence for the existence of God in other ways that require us to use logic and reasoning . We might reason for instance , say that if Jesus ' body was still rotting in the tomb , then it is most likely that the authorities would have displayed it in order to crush the Christian faith ( for they had every motive to ) . And if they had produced the corpse , then it is almost certain that Christianity would have been destroyed ( for the early Christians believed in nothing less than the literal bodily resurrection ) . Given that the faith was not destroyed , it is implausible that His body was still in the tomb . Of course , there is a whole lot more to consider than this . Furthermore , a miraclous event ( such as Jesus ' resurrection ) is improbable on the assumption that the miracle did not occur - but is to be expected on the assumption that it did . That is , if there was no resurrection , the emergence of Christianity is highly improbable ; but if there was a resurrection , the emergence of Christianity is very likely . This is in the form `` if A happened , then it is most likely that B '' .

It turns out that the fossil record is excellent evidence in favor of evolution . This because not only are transitional fossils found , that is fossils that have `` in between '' characteristics that link later groups with earlier groups , but these transitionals usually have precise characteristics that were predicted by the theory of evolution even before their discover .
As the floodwaters advanced during the global Flood , humans would have fled to higher ground , swam or held on to floating debris for as long as possible . Also , human corpses bloat and therefore float on the waters surface . Hence very few , if any , humans would be buried by sediment . Instead they would have rotted and decayed without fossilization .

In Antarctica , penguins had plenty of fur , enough to die when they progressed to the tropics . However , penguins also had variation in their fur , so when a current brought them to the Galapagos , they quickly started to evolve . The few nucleotides that controlled fur thickness made a large difference to the survival of the penguins . In this case , they were important enough to make a difference easily . The DNA was inherited as a single unit , but some single units had single parts that made a difference .

4 . One misconception is that Evolution does n't explain how life formed originally or came to be . It explains how life changed after already being . Evolution is basically the change in allelle frequency over time . It helps explain how life adapts , changes and how we and modern animals came to be , not how life orignally started . That 's another topic and theory . Life probably started through abiogenesis , which God conflicts with more . Life probably started with one molecule and went on , forming more complex organisms due to certain conditions and stimuli .
7 Teens Shot Near Detroit High School By JEFF KAROUB , AP DETROIT ( June 30 ) - Gunmen in a green minivan opened fire on a group of teenagers waiting at a bus stop near a Detroit school on Tuesday , wounding seven including three who were in critical condition , authorities said . Five of the teens had just left Cody Ninth Grade Academy , where they were taking summer classes , when they were shot at the nearby bus stop . The gunmen exited a vehicle and `` asked for a person by name '' before they `` opened fire at the crowd , '' said Detroit Public Schools Police Chief Roderick Grimes . Detroit Police were looking for two suspects in a green minivan , said spokesman Rod Liggons . The teenagers , four boys and three girls , range in age from 14 to 17 years old , Liggons said . Three of the teens were in critical condition , he said . Another summer school student , 15-year-old Bria Wilson , said she was standing at the bus stop when she heard the gunfire . She said she was facing away from the shooters and ran away after the shots were fired . But she saw a 16-year-old male friend lying on the ground , bleeding . `` They were so close  it almost hit me , '' she said . Schools spokesman Steve Wasko said there was `` nothing that we 're aware of at this time '' linking the shootings with any fight or dispute at the school . He said the shootings happened about 2:15 p.m. , about 15 minutes after summer school students were dismissed for the day . Imam Abdullah El-Amin , who co-owns the Numan Funeral Home near the intersection where the shooting took place , said drug-dealing , prostitution and `` hopelessness '' are common in the area , he said . `` It 's terrible that these things are just laying there , festering , in society  time bombs waiting to happen , '' said El-Amin , a Muslim minister and candidate for Detroit City Council . Associated Press writers Ben Leubsdorf and David N. Goodman contributed to this report .
tell me this and ask as many questions as you want , I can answer and truthfully .
George Washington was quoted to say `` You can not call yourself an American and subvert the word of God . ''
the formation or expression of an opinion or theory without sufficient evidence for proof .
Granted these are all not necessarily plausible , but never-the-less they are just as plaussible that the dog was subject to a random bout of evolution . Further , you said ... `` Just to show what my personal feelings are on God , if I seen him appear in the sky right now and waved at me , I 'd drop all my previous ideas and accept that he exists without hesitation . '' I doubt it . You 'd go over what you had that day and see if there was any contamination in the food - or you 'd say you were suffereing some other sort of thing that you could rationalise away they mystery of this event .
If I am to believe in something even if it 's scientific , I should be able to challenge the belief 's of the person who 's pushing it . If they do n't believe what they 're selling , why should I .
Were n't you guys doubting the destruction of those records just a little while ago ?
You can preach about abortion being bad and even protest it , but why should you try and force your beliefs on others ? I know this is the essence of Christianity , but why should it extend to society ?
Ironically , when I have publicaly advanced the idea that God is generally compatable with evolution , I find that my agnostic and atheistic colleagues are generally comfortable with such ideas , but many believers are dumbfounded .
Substitute the word `` segregation '' for `` guns '' and you will see just how utterly ridiculous your point is .

Man has changed significantly in the past few thousand years . I see you opted out of history classes and took it upon yourself to make up your own version .
So suddenly , being supervised by not one , but two law-abiding qualified ( in one case an instructor ! ) adults is not safe ? Who administered the training and qualifications of the instructor ? Who drew up the regulations which allowed this to happen ? Who pays lip service to `` safety '' in the use of their deadly toys ? We constantly hear that only criminals with guns are a threat , and the law-abiding gun owner is a paragon of rational safe behaviour . This is all too obviously not so .
Your definition is that those creatures with survival advantages and characteristics will survive .
That 's true , as long as ones pursuit of science is really science . In the case of `` creation science , '' there is no science involved . As trebor has said , `` creation science '' is an attempt to find scientific sounding reasons that can be used to justify the conclusions that have already been reached and that are not subject to change . That 's how `` creation science '' works . Begin with the conclusion and then search for scientific sounding justification . Real science is a process and a way of learning .
a belief held by a majority does not mean it is superior to that held by a minority . there is no numerical superiority when it comes to truths , values or morality .
Makes quite a difference . Still a third trimester baby .

Scott , You missed Monty 's point . Catholics ARE Christians . I 've heard that there are more than 1000 different sects that claim to be Christian , including Orthodox Christians and various and sundry Protestant sects . It would have been more correct for you to state that basically everyone you know is Christian .
The wewll-known scientist , Lee Spetner , picks up on this dishonesty --

Sorry to disappoint you , I do n't believe anything about anything unknowable .
So if Utah made a law or a governor stated that christians did n't need protection because of their beliefs even if there were incidents of anti chrisitan beating and harassment let alone murder for their beliefs you would just say let states have their own laws ?
Regarding the Exodus passage : Why should men fighting each other , hitting a pregnant woman , and thereby causing her to miscarry or give birth prematurely ( take your pick on which is the better translation ) be considered `` abortion '' in the first place ? It seems to me the position of the woman is rather different in the two scenarios ! I 'm not saying abortion is always morally acceptable , not by a longshot . But I 'm also not saying it never is , either .
So what . Congress can pass any law it wants . Does n't mean it will stand up in court .
First off , Congratulations are in order ( HUGZ ) ! As for a ceremony : If were to ever get married , I think it would be relatively small ( 50 to 100 people max ) and out in a an open meadow ( weather permitting ) , or at least a lush green park or back yard . My partner and I would escort each other up the aisle in matching grey tuxes , to a simple platform with a white garden archway decorated in white flowers , where a justice of the peace presides over a simple ceremony . We would read vows to one another and then be pronounced partners in life , and then just have a fabulous garden party . How doeas that sound ?
Let me simplify this for you , does ones personal beliefs about how oil got there effect ones ability to locate it according to the known applications of the science of Geology ? Of course not , but you will never cease to ask the dumbest questions if you think it will insult creationists .
Bad comparisons . A fair comparison would be comparing the total number of defensive gun uses to the total number of gun crimes ( not just limiting it to gun homicides ) .
I heard just shortly after the official passage that the nutters at the ACLU were already poised to argue that the State Supreme Court reverse the decision for the exact opposite reason they argued to block Pro 22 , geeez talk about get your arguments straight . It will get dismissed as frivolous just like last time ... these big babies are suffering from `` shallow hal '' disorder ... they somehow believe of the majority votes in their favor - then it is a mandate , but the minute it is n't in their favor ... [ well ] they fall into a grand mal seizure . There must not be something `` fair '' in it as far as they are concerned - Fair has nothing to do with it , our laws do n't exist for fairness sake ... they exist for clarity . Let 's not forget the most important over arching reality here ... this is something that is n't even supposed to be up for discussion for legislative agenda . We have no business even talking this nonsense ... gays are not some `` class '' that need to be protected . They are citizens engaging in a behavior that falls wildly short of the overall purview of not only the electorate as the existing status quo [ regardless of political affiliation ] but is nothing short of a deviant sexual proclivity , that ... and our laws do n't ' exist to morally equivocate deviancy with that of the morally clear . It is a simple matter of constants vs. variables ... our laws protect what you are [ the constant ] not who you become [ the variable ] , what then do we say ? do we create laws and burden our courts with personal subjectivity ... or do we look to the objective as we have , and should continue to do so . These radical homosexual activists are literally insane to think people are simply going to let them walk all over the natural order of things in favor of a bio [ illogical ] behavior ? The US Constitution does not guarantee the equality of feelings , nor does it behavior . People have to start clearing the closet ... so to speak , and simply be down to earth and accept that not all your decisions are going to be popular ones , and homosexuality is one of them - and you certainly do n't win fans by thinking you can leverage the guilt game on people even thinking you can draw comparisons between color [ innate ] and sexual preference [ choice ] as a basis for some perceived civil right , it is just plain and utter nonsense .
It actually saves us money . The death penalty ( because of appeals ) costs more than solitary confinement for life , both of which would ensure that the person would never kill again . Also I have the same question for drug users , gamblers , etc . Why make society pay to imprison them when all they are doing is hurt themselves ?
The reality is we all live on faith .

Are you incapable of reading , as well as being mind-numbingly assinine ? The thread is about creationism , not evolution . Attacking evolution does not defend the lies of creationists . Your failure to defend biblical creation shows that you can not support your own position and instead have to resort to petty nit-picking of your opponent 's position . This is both stupid and intellectually dishonest .
What makes you think the politics of the parents will be the politics of the children ?
The people that already own weapons do n't seem to be doing much to combat crime
Any time you have a benefits plan , you are going to have to have limits on it . Try actually READING your article and THINKING as you do . So , you are talking an incredibly expensive drug that MAY work 20 % of the time when it is used . Are they just letting these people die ... .giving them morphine for the pain and letting them waste away ? No So , what is the current treatment and how effective is it ? Obviously it is more COST effective . We dont know what the current treatment is , or how effective it is , because what you posted here is a one sided opinion piece masquerading as a news article , and you ate it up .
But how often do contraceptives fail ? Planned Parenthoods Alan Guttmacher Institute reported on 10,000 women getting abortions . Of these , 57.5 % said they were using a contraceptive the month they became pregnant . In a similar study in 1987 the figure was 51.3 % .
I guess that is your opinion , so if you ever get raped do n't get an abortion.The point is , is that it is a choice and not yours.If a women ( girl ) is molested or raped and does n't feel comfortable keeping the baby who are you to decide that for them ? Personally if I were raped and became pregnant I WOULD NOT keep the fetus , if someone else thought differently and they decided to keep a rape fetus more power to them , but do n't expect everbody to feel the same as you do.The best person to make that choice is the one that has been through the rape/incest and has to live with the outcome .
Omegamon_X said something in another thread that that raised some questions in my mind : Mainly : why ? Specifically , why worry about the threat of potential harm from criminals ? Statistically , the risk of such is relatively low compared to , say , the leading killer in the developed world . You face a much greater threat of potential harm from that than at the hands of a criminal . Are you as adamant about eating healthy as you are about the need to have a gun ? The fact is , we all constantly face the threat of potential harm every minute of every day . Risk is a part of living . I would like to know why guns specifically are needed to mitigate the risk of being the victim of a crime , when other methods ( better locks , alarms , non-lethal weapons like pepper spray and tasers ) can be effective .
No , you need to read more carefully : Botched abortions are one of the causes of death , but the primary causes of death are bleeding , infection , high blood pressure and prolonged labor . And , if abortion were safe and legal and offered as an option during the early term of a pregnancy , particularly in the case of young girls , that cause of death would be dramatically reduced .
I have brought up the following item for discussion before , but it seems relevant here , too . Assuming abortion is justified as one means of acheiving the goal of population control , is it outrageous to consider 'removing ' non-productive members of our society as another means of achieving the same goal ?
You know , I 'm an evolutionist too , but I do think there 's entirely too much vitriol toward creationists out there right now . I rarely read a post , blog article , or editorial where ID'ers are n't insulted and intentionally belittled . People are making heroes out of hateful people like Dawkins who seem to get a lot of glee out of belittling and insulting people . For some unfortunate reason , a lot of scientists seem to have moved from being fact-driven , objective observers to being what amounts to belligerent ideologues . I have n't seen Expelled yet , but I think that 's part of what it 's trying to get across , according to what I 've read . This change in tact by scientists is too bad , because I think evolution and the facts would be better served by taking the high road . The facts do n't NEED insults to be facts ; science does n't need evangelism and crusading to be science . If scientists think that it does , then these scientists must think it 's pretty weak science to begin with . I think this new culture of ridicule among scientists is probably doing as much to hurt what they think of as a cause , rather than helping it .
Many posts ago I told you that I could n't relocate the link , and so to forget about it , but you keep bringing it back , like a puppy with a chewed up slipper . Why is that ?
the problem is , if evolution is indeed true , then the story in Genesis is false . and if Genesis is false , then the Bible is not entirely true Or perhaps Genesis is a moral story and is n't supposed to be a literal event . In which case the Bible remains true . In fact many Christians , Jews and Muslims take this view .

Boopie , you ca n't be Catholic and support aborton . You 're automatically excommunicated if you support abortion and only can come back into the church via confession .
I actually think that ID has a pretty good chance of winning . One reason being is that ID links with the idea of God was taught to them even before they understood it , so it holds a deep impression on many people there . Another reason I think is that most of them probably never took a decent bio class , so they would have no idea what the evolutionsist was talking about . Lastly , people hold God in a lot higher posistion in their minds then evolution , already giving evolution a bad reputation , because its `` competing '' with God .
The term 'bear arms ' usually referred military service at the time of the writing of the second amendment . This is evident from the first draft of the second amendment in which James Madison states , 'no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person . ' Although the pro-gun lobby likes to equate 'bearing arms ' with carrying a gun , to James Madison the term meant 'to render military service . ' Lastly , what arms were they founders referring to ? Muskets , not machine guns , semi-automatic assault rifles nor Uzis . Obviously , using the second amendment to oppose laws regulating such weapons is highly questionably . ''

The death penalty assures that an incorragable criminal never has the opportunity to kill anybody else . In prison , the criminal could a ) kill another inmate , 2 ) kill a guard , 3 ) escape and kill a civilian , 4 ) have their sentence commuted and get out to commit another crime . Quote : Would you agree if the death penalty was banned ? No , for the reasons stated above and one more . Some people do n't deserve to live ... .like SH , for example . __________________ True , gang members put in prison often kill other opposing gang members in prison so that is true . They also get put in prison and are proud some of them , gang leaders consider it a mark of honor something some of them getting caught by the 'fuzz ' and put in jail . Who are we to decide who is to live ? What makes us so much better ? Hitler didnt deserve to live but that does not give us the right to kill him . I agree with shooter and proud but hey heres a situation , why do n't we give murderers fates to the ones most hurt by their crime , and rapists fates are decided by the ones t hey rape . They would know the best . IF the ones raped are too young such as under maybe 10 or are like seven or its a loved one and they ca n't seperate justice from love , then the case be decided by law . Give them the chance to live in solitary confinement , give them the chance , we can always take it away . But those killed do n't get no more chances . In prison if they do kill put them in confinement . Same with the others , if they are in solitary and they succeed in killing someone else , death penalty then fine . But gang murders should be different , if someone is in jail for killing a gang member in a fight or something like that , it is murder but it isnt as open and as clear justice as it is if they shot a four year old in the head for being related to someone in an opposing gang . Then its wrong flat out , solitary or death penalty . Personally Id be for giving them death penalty for anyone who would do that . But I have two three year old cousins who I love to death and would kill anyone who harmed them so I do not want anyone to get away with killing kids . Child killers are some of the worst criminals there are .
President Obama signed legislation letting people carry concealed weapons in national parks and in checked luggage on Amtrak trains , adopted the gun lobbys empty rhetoric about just enforcing the laws on the books ,  and muzzled Cabinet members who expressed support for stronger gun laws . In addition , the White House voiced no objection to people carrying guns near Presidential events and his White House staff removed statements from the White House website that declared support for gun violence prevention laws . What a traitor !
dzeron raises an interesting point ... the realm of `` possible '' is limited . that is , after you 've done everything that is possible , there 's nothing left but the impossible to do ( and the impossible cant be done ) . so in a way , its not like integers , there is a limit to `` possible '' beyond which nothing more is possible . at that point you simply cant add 1 to the last possible thing , as with integers . if there is a being that can do and know everything that is possible , then no greaters being can exist , because nothing more than `` everything that is possibe '' is possible zachvac kinda hit the nail on the head . if we agree that there is such a thing as `` the greatest being possible '' , then all that is left to do is specifically demonstrate what a `` possbility '' really is for example , is it possible to create a mercedes-benz from a tree ? if we define this as impossible , then not even God can do it , since God can only do what is possible ( by definition ) . is it possible to create a book from a tree ? if it is possible then God can do this . if we define God as `` the greatest being possible '' , then what we define as `` possible '' ultimately defines God

If you base your beliefs on science you will almost always have to change them so are they really beliefs ?
That I guess is one of my main stumbling blocks in believing in evolution .
I do n't believe in any gods , but thankyou for assuming anyone who disagrees with your ridiculous assertions about proving gods non-existance must be a theist . Just like creationists assume anyone who disagrees with creationism must be an atheist . You 're just as bad as them , and your arguments , if you could call them that , just as short on substance .

Now , anthropology , archeology , and forensics are constantly deciding that entities are manufactured by an intelligent entity -- humans in this case .

The fact that much of society views this issue differently than the issue of black people only underscores my point . There are lots of people who would and do give full support to civil rights , but not to issues of homosexuality .

You 're starting to sound like someone who understands evolution . I do n't see your argument here , you 're basically supporting the steps necessary for natural selection . What you describe is one small step for evolution , you just have to repeat this 1,000,000 times over various other environmental and competitive contraints ( sic ) and viola , you 'll probably see evolution at work on a scale that you can recognize . You 're almost there montalban ! -Mach
Well , then . They 're not TROO christians . Just ask a certain poster on this board . When I told this certain poster that I have known several clergymen from several Christian denominations who accepted evolutionary theory , that 's what he told me . That certain poster and others would rather claim Newton , who was an arian , as a christian rather than clergymen who accept the divinity of Christ . Those clergy just understand both science and religion better .
`` There is far more proof needed to reasonably believe what 's asserted in the Bible than there are for most things . `` Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence '' - Carl Sagan . I think that statement really is true . Just imagine a couple statements I could make and what the proper reactions should be to them . 1 . I was sitting in my room last night and I got a call from a friend of mine . The normal response is `` ok '' . Everybody has phones , most people have friends , people calling their friends is a very normal thing to do ... if this is the only statement I make about that call , there 's really no reason for anybody to question the validity of it . 2 . I was sitting in my room last night , and a stranger wearing a black trenchcoat came and knocked on my door . This statement should be questioned somewhat . A person wearing a black trenchcoat during the summer in Florida is odd , but not the craziest thing anyone 's ever seen probably ... it does need to be explained though.. more detail is needed to conclude that this probably did happen . I should be able to explain the reason this happened adequately for somebody to believe that this actually happened . 3 . Last night I was sitting in my room and the walls started bleeding , then several of our founding fathers ' ghosts walked out of my closet and told me it was my mission to make sure that church and state remain seperate . Everyone that hears me say that , should automatically say `` no '' , until I provide some amazing , concrete proof of that . We know about the physical makeup of my bedroom walls , they ca n't bleed . The idea of ghosts from the past coming to visit people I would imagine is 100 % foreign to just about everyone ... so nobody 's word should be taken on that either . This is the problem with the resurrection and miracles of Jesus ... believers think we should believe it 's true and just give it the kind of inspection like in number 1 or maybe number 2 , but they 're things that nobody living today has actually witnessed anything similar to ... it defies the laws of science and nature to the extent that we know them ... and the closest evidence we have of them is a couple eye-witness accounts ( questionably ) , which were n't even written within 15 years of his death . There is no rational basis for believing it based on this ... ANY feasible explanation that falls within the realm of reason and nature should ALWAYS be taken over any explanation which turns to the supernatural and irrational . '' -mD

Well , I am a creationist , and I would hope I can think logically ( it 's generally a good quality for an accountant and tax attorney to have ) . The difference between microevolution and evolution as an explanation for the beginning of a species is simple . In microevolution a species is simply adapting to it 's environments . In evolution as is usually meant by the word you are talking about the formation of an entirely new creature from inorganic compounds . If this is possible I pose a few questions for you . 1 ) Why have no new creatures evolved from inorganic compounds in human memory ? 2 ) How did these inorganic compounds decide that some creatures should evolve , while others of the same species did not ? Why are there not some apes that have evolved into humans by now ? Why did n't all apes evolve into humans ? 3 ) One of my favorite pieces of confusion from evolutionists involve fossils . How do you know how old a fossil is ? Every evolutionist I have asked has stated that fossils are dated by the rock layer they are found in , but if you then ask them how the rock layer is dated they answer that it is dated by the fossils that where discovered in it ! That 's a classical example of circular reasoning . I am not a scientist , so I can not present all the evidence against evolution as clearly as someone with a scientific education and background might do . If you are truly interested in learning more about the creationist arguments against evolution you can check out the article located at http : //www.answersingenesis.org/docs2004/1106ng.asp . This article also has many links to other articles with even more information .

Maybe they should give God credit for things because He is omnipotent and omnipresent . Maybe because He created us to love Him and serve Him . Maybe because He has blessed America in so many ways !
And you condemn people for dancing in the blood of the victims ?
And I 'll bet the formal list of `` great physicists '' who preceded the development of the theory of evolution is meaningful . I wonder how many of these `` great physicists '' also believed that night air could make them ill ? How many beleived in alchemy , like Newton ? I wonder if Newton is in that list ? He did n't believe in the divinity of Christ .
# 1 - How are we now able to observe evolution , when the evolution of the world supposely took billions of years ?
Through evolution we have been able to trace how life has evolved ( which even ID admits ) through time . We have been able to understand genetics and how genetics factor into our physical appearance by studying the evolution of humans through time by examining the fossil record .

Those who have firearms in their homes are more likely to die of murder
It is a rare event . Other than self-defense , the use of a gun against another human is socially undesirable . Regular citizens with guns , who are sometimes tired , angry , drunk , or afraid , and who are not trained in dispute resolution , have lots of opportunities for inappropriate gun uses . People engage in innumerable annoying and somewhat hostile interactions with each other in the course of a lifetime . It should not be surprising that inappropriate , socially undesirable 'self-defense ' gun uses by people who believe they are law-abiding citizens outnumber the appropriate and socially beneficial use of guns.6 '' http : //www.hsph.harvard.edu/research ... pring_2009.pdf

Sorry if this is the wrong forum , but a weapon is a weapon so here I am . I am a photographer , and I photograph mostly landscapes and cityscapes . I have traveled to numerous cities ( LA , 'Frisco , NYC , etc . ) to photograph its buildings , culture , and people . The law regarding the carry and use of pepper spray does not make any sense to me . In all of these places , I am not legally permitted to carry pepper spray because of my age . In all three of these cities as in most states , it is illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to carry pepper spray . Are n't we the ones who need the most protection ? I 'm only 16 , and I 'm a little short and quite skinny . I seriously do n't feel safe marching around the city sporting expensive and flashy camera gear , but I do n't really have a choice . Some of the most interesting places to photograph are poverty stricken and usually unsafe . With child molesters , rapists , robbers , etc out there just waiting to take advantage of a minor because of his/her small size , would n't the carrying of pepper spray not only be legal but encouraged ? I do n't understand how any state could leave one of their physically weakest minorities so vulnerable . I can understand limiting the possession of knives and guns to minors , because those are both deadly weapons and , to be frank , some of my peers are numbskulls . But , both pepper spray and stun guns have been proven to do no permanent damage to the human body . By the time one is about 15 , one is responsible enough to know not to spray someone because `` he gave me a funny look '' , `` I do n't like him '' , or employ its use in a fist fight . If every child molester knew most teenagers were packin non-lethal weapons , do you think he would still attack ? Can someone please explain this to me ?

No biggy . I am happy though that you did take more than reasonable precautions to prevent pregnancy in the 1st place .
Abstinence until marriage is still the best way .
I do n't believe that he likes women very much . In fact , I am rather concerned about how Cybererratus feels about women .
Both Thompson and McDonagh treat the childthe woman 's own daughter or son -- like an invading stranger intent on doing harm . They make the mother/child union into a host/predator relationship . A child is not an invader , though , a parasite living off his mother . A mother 's womb is the baby 's natural environment . Eileen McDonagh wants us to believe that the child growing inside of a woman is trespassing . One trespasses when he 's not in his rightful place , but a baby developing in the womb belongs there .
Now we come to the problem with the `` theory '' of intelligent design . There simply has been no thinking involved . The equivalent of ID is doing all the experiments with the apple , measuring the mass of the apple and the Earth , and figuring out gravity , publishing it , and the public supporting that hypothesis with their experiments , with no refutations or flaws , and then some people coming along and saying , `` well maybe magic fairies caused the apple to fall just the way it does , ever think of that ? We should teach them that this is a valid alternative to gravity . '' I also offer you this for humor : http : //www.venganza.org/
LOL ; what a silly attempt to solicit sympathy and total load of BS . Like the `` little ones '' are really that interested in the political greed of gay activism . Heck , most kids do n't have to be taught that gay relationships are n't normal -- they have more sense sometimes than a lot of adults in this country .
I think we 're seeing a culture war . Hardly seems a fair fight though , since only one side has any .
Is there any way to make a person out of a rib ? I mean , it sounds like a fairy tale to me .
I understand it to be a double standard . The mother will have the ability to force the father into paying for something he did n't consent to ! Seems like a double standard . The arguments are the same ... you just do n't like the outcome of one I think the mother should n't have the right to kill the unborn and the father should have to pay

What 's the difference between humans and chimps ?
With all the medical technology a child should be born and the mother survive .
They are MAD that a Black Man ! Is in the White House !
As an aside I invite readers to observe , going forward , how these issues are often treated as interchangeable by those advocating ID in the classroom .

The Hidden Agenda Behind Gun Storage Laws By David Kopel In Canada and Great Britain deceitful `` safe storage '' laws allow government invasion of gun owners` homes . These laws are all part of the gun grabbers` wholesale attack on private gun ownership . Responsible gun owners store their guns safely . For over a century , the National Rifle Association and other civic groups have done everything they can to encourage safe gun storage . Partly as a result , the fatal gun accident rate for both kids and adults has fallen to an all-time low . In spite of this , anti-gun politicians , and the anti-gun groups are working to turn `` safe storage '' into a tool for disarming the American public . Gun owners who think they have nothing to lose from a government takeover of gun storage should look at what has happened in countries such as Canada and Great Britain . There , gun owner apathy has allowed `` safe storage '' to become the platform for abolishing gun ownership for home protection , for invading the privacy and the homes of gun owners , and for attacking even the simple possession of firearms . Great Britain British gun owners have a long tradition of going along with government proposals for `` reasonable '' restrictions on their rights . But as many Britons found out too late , a restriction that appears reasonable on paper may become quite unreasonable in practice . British law merely mandates that guns be stored in `` a secure place . '' But Britain has a national gun licensing system , similar to the American system proposed by Sarah Brady of Handgun Control , Inc. Because most police administrators in Britain are intensely opposed to citizens owning guns , they use the storage law to make acquiring a gun license as onerous as possible . If you want to obtain or renew a gun license in Britain , two police officers will visit your home to scrutinize your gun security system . Although the law , even today , does not order guns to be locked in a safe , the police routinely compel gun owners to purchase safes -- sometimes two safes , the second one for separate storage of ammunition . A person buying a low-powered L5 rimfire rifle may have to spend £100 on a safe . A person with five guns may be ordered to add a £1000 electronic security system . One effect of the heavy security costs is to reduce the ability of middle-income or poor people to legally own guns , a goal which has been a constant objective of gun control proponents throughout history . Of course , the requirement that guns be locked in safes makes it nearly impossible for the gun to be used for home protection and the British police establishment despises the idea of defensive gun ownership . If you want to obtain or renew a gun license in Britain , two police officers will visit your home to scrutinize your gun security system . The requirement that gun owners purchase safes was never democratically enacted by the British Parliament . Rather , the requirement was invented by police administrators , who correctly recognized that any system requiring government permission to buy a gun can be manipulated by anti-gun administrators . ( Similarly , in the United States , police administrators have used the Brady Act to deny handgun purchases by thousands of people with unpaid traffic tickets or other trivial offenses . Brady does not formally sanction such abuses , but by requiring government permission for handgun purchases , the Act makes such abuses inevitable . ) Canada In Canada , the Criminal Code prohibits `` careless '' storage of a firearm , and gives the government the authority to create storage regulations . What does this mean in practice ? Consider some cases from 1996 and 1997 : Hearing suspicious sounds , perhaps from a burglar , a husband took his unloaded rifle with him one night when he looked around his house . A few days later , the wife told a friend about the incident . Aghast , the friend called the police . The police arrived at the couple`s home and bullied their way in . Searching the home , they found the unloaded rifle under a mattress in the bedroom . No children lived in the home . The couple was charged with careless storage of a firearm . A 67-year-old single woman ran a small boarding house in Ontario . A downstairs tenant began harassing and stalking her . Worried that the woman might pose a threat to the tenant , the police searched her apartment and found several unloaded guns in her closets . She was convicted of storage of a firearm in violation of government regulations . She had been attending school and studying to become a paralegal , but her conviction will bar her from a job in the legal field . Recently in Winnipeg , a 72-year-old woman called a hospital to request that a visiting nurse come over and help her with some medication . Someone from the hospital asked if the woman had any firearms in the home . `` Yes , '' she replied , `` my husband has a couple of old hunting rifles down in the rec room . '' The police came over immediately and began searching the home . They found several long guns , each with a trigger lock and locked to a rack in the basement . They also found a .25 caliber pistol locked in a bedroom closet , which they had broken into . The 73-year-old husband came home in the middle of the search , and was immediately handcuffed , and accused of being violent . Other than the fact that he owned guns , there was no evidence that he was violent . ( His neighbors later signed statements saying they had known him for years , and he had always been peaceful . ) Eventually the police removed the handcuffs , and told the man that he had never been under arrest . Gun storage laws sometimes provide a means for police to justify outrageously bad police work . In Medicine Hat , Alberta , a criminal who had charges pending against him tried to buy leniency by claiming that a man named Larry Davies was a marijuana dealer , with over a pound in his house . The Medicine Hat police did nothing to verify the informant`s claim , other than looking up Larry Davies` address in the phone book . The SWAT team , apparently having nothing else to do that day , broke into the Davies household , and forced Larry Davies and three friends to the floor , pointing submachine guns at their heads . A search of the house revealed : Mrs. Davies and her newborn baby , who had come home from the hospital that day ; four grams of marijuana ( weighing less than a United States 25-cent piece ) ; and a disassembled FN/FAL rifle in a basement closet . Apparently embarrassed but not repentant about the sloppy police practices and wanton show of force , the government charged Mr. Davies with unsafe storage of a firearm . Happily , a judge threw the charges out of court , noting that whatever Mr. Davies had done was much less of a threat to society than what the police had done . And Canadian courts have sometimes stopped other abusive prosecutions related to gun storage laws . But even then , the victim of the abusive prosecution must spend thousands of dollars in legal fees to avoid a prison sentence of up to two years . As David Tomlinson , President of Canada`s National Firearms Association , points out , gun storage laws are unenforceable without random police searches of the home . Canada`s newest gun law , which goes into effect next year , gives the police the authority to `` inspect '' private homes to ensure that gun storage laws are being complied with . Gun storage laws are like laws barring married couples from using birth control : they are unenforceable without massive government intrusions into the sanctity of the home . In 1965 , the United States Supreme Court struck down a birth control ban for this very reason . ( Griswold v. Connecticut , 381 U.S. 479 ( 1965 ) ) . For the same reason , privacy-minded legislators and citizens should reject turning the government into the home gun storage enforcer . Former-President Clinton , by the way , effusively praised the new Canadian gun law ( Bill C-68 ) which authorizes searches without probable cause . SMALL STEPS Gun prohibition almost always moves by incremental steps . Restrictions that would have seemed outrageous if proposed by themselves can appear `` reasonable '' when they merely advance existing restrictions a few more steps . Gun storage laws are . . . unenforceable without massive government intrusions into the sanctity of the home . In Canada , prohibitionists , such as then-Justice Minister Alan Rock , have used gun storage laws as a justification for imposing universal gun registration , since registration `` will create a sense of accountability on the part of the firearms owner to comply with some of the safe storage laws that are in effect . '' As the next step , the anti-gun lobbies in Canada have begun pushing for `` community storage . '' Rather than keeping your guns in a safe in your home , you would have to keep your guns at a police station . When you wanted to use your gun for the day , you could check it out from the police station . The anti-gun groups point out that a gun in the home could be stolen , or could be misused in a domestic incident . There is no reason , they argue , for guns to be kept in a home 365 days a year , when the gun may only be used a few days a year . To counter the anti-gun groups , gun owners in Canada can hardly argue that removing guns from the home makes it impossible to use the guns for home defense . They gave up the moral case for self-defense years ago by arguing that gun ownership was justified for sporting purposes , but not daring to assert that gun ownership is justified for defensive purposes . And by agreeing to `` safe storage '' laws , the Canadian gun owners gave up the practical ability to use a gun for self-defense in a sudden emergency . With so much ground already conceded , Canadian gun owners are reduced to arguing minor points , such as how a centralized gun storage repository might be more vulnerable to theft . Even conceding on the `` community storage '' issue will do gun owners no good . In 1996 , the British Parliament banned almost all handguns , but allowed owners of single-shot .22s to keep the guns locked in central repositories at gun ranges . The new restrictions only briefly sated the appetite of the British anti-gun lobbies . In 1997 , community storage was replaced by its logical consequence , complete prohibition of all handguns . The Future Who can believe that the right to keep and bear arms could survive `` community storage , '' with gun owners needing to ask government bureaucrats for permission to obtain access to their own guns ? Who can believe that the American anti-gun lobbies , who so consistently imitate the programs of their foreign cousins , will not begin demanding community storage , once they have laid the foundation with `` safe storage '' laws ? Storing guns safely is the duty of every gun owner . What makes for safety depends very much on individual circumstances . Safety is , and always has been , the concern of organizations such as the National Rifle Association . In the hands of anti-gun lobbies and government bureaucrats , though , `` safe storage '' becomes an Orwellian term designed to negate the many safety benefits of the right to bear arms . Home safety is the responsibility of the family , not the state .

So the stats come from John Lott ... . Was n't he the one who got caught making up statistics and impersonated a woman for three years to support the pro-gun cause ?
Lets say that at some point in the near future a world was found on which lived beings with an intelligence and self awareness like our own along with society , religion and culture . These Beings have a religion that contains a story that says their world was created by a deity 3000 years after when literal Genesists say the earth was created ( ie . if now , this would make their universe 3000 years old ) . When the religious members of each race discover the others beliefs , it causes much consternation as both claim to have the truth of God on their side . How would each group of literal belivers react to the other ? the Genesists say the Beings story can not be correct because the Bible is the word of God and it records 6000 years of history . The Beings can not accept the history of Genesis as it claims th universe existed 3000 years before their holy text records the creation of the universe and their first members by their God . Both claim to have the evidence of the word of God in their holy books , and their respective histories are truth . But their truth 's disagree ... ... .. who is `` right '' who has the real `` truth '' ?

3 ) Make sure the parts of your source that you do n't quote do n't contain info that harms your argument . Larry Flynt bases nearly all of this theory on the alleged event of Bush visiting the girl in the hospital after she had an abortion . If this ever did occur there is no evidence that Bush knew that she had an abortion . Flynt says so himself :
Famous British evolutionary anthropologist and anatomist , Sir Arthur Keith , is quoted as saying , `` Evolution is unproved and unprovable . We believe it only because the alternative is Special Creation , and that is unthinkable . '' However , this is not acceptable under general principles of science . Unless a natural mechanism constrained by Natural Law , by which the entire universe could come into existence and further develop through random process , is found , a Creator must be the theoretical default . It does n't matter whether an individual scientist has difficulty accepting it or not . As Sir Arthur Conan Doyle so eloquently stated in his Sherlock Holmes series , `` Once you eliminate the impossible , whatever remains , no matter how improbable , must be the truth . ''
Second , the majority of the world believes there is a god , and the others do n't want to believe ( hope there is n't ) a god

Depending on perspective , everything or nothing . Many on the liberal front often tell us that the police are there for the purpose of protecting us , that they 'll keep us safe , that we do n't need a gun if we just call 911 and let the police handle it , etc . Well a lot of good that advice is gon na do these South Carolina people , now that the police have been ordered not to pursue criminals who run from the scene of a crime . If they start hopping fences then the police ca n't pursue in their squad cars , and they ca n't get out to chase after them either . So ... even before , the courts have stated explicitly that the job of the police is not to protect anyone , and now we have mayors ordering the police to not apprehend fleeing criminals . This means that those townspeople are gon na need to rely on themselves . And if the gun control laws are liberal and excessively strict , they 're SOL . Innocent people are gon na get getting killed because of this new policy .

If everyone had both male and female reproductive organs ( and , for the sake of argument , they could not impregnate themselves ) , in what ways do you believe the general view on abortion would change ?

you 've got to be kidding me . This has got to be one of the absolute dumbest things I have heard . You are truly one confused individual if you ca n't tell there 's a distinct difference between a living thing and a nonliving thing -- that non-living things are missing something that living things have ... . Just because this difference can not be analyzed , measured or defined does not mean it 's not there . You ca n't analyze or define your thought patterns , dreams , brainwaves or consciousness either -- but that does not mean they are n't there . I think you 've lost it -- You may very well belong in a mental facility .
Presumably you will want to select a few people to judge your debate before you begin .
Incidentally , I am interested in your comment that natural selection is consistent with creationism . It was Darwin who first proposed that natural selection can be the major force driving the evolution of species . Creationists pretty much tried to discredit natural selection for over a century . It was only after scientific evidence was presented that showed decisively that natural selection was , indeed , a major contributor to evolution that creationists were finally forced to accept it . I would be interested in know who was the first creationist to finally accept that natural selection is a real phenomenon , and when they accepted it .
I agree ... and there is lots of life sitting in state homes waiting for that hope ! Let 's take care of them first then we can take care of the unborn .

Got that , boys and girls ... registration and prohibitions on transporting some firearms across state lines ? If the Dems thought a new AWB was going to be a s & amp ; % tstorm of epic proportions , wait until they wade into registration and bans on transportation of firearms .

The `` compromise '' Pelosi is talking about would lay the groundwork for door-to-door confiscations , which has been the end game all along .
The ban on assault weapons stands on such poltically weak and Constitutionally weak ground that Congress only had the guts and the will to try it for 10 years . It expires this year . The right to own arms is expressly clear . It shall not be infringed by Congress . The federal government is fully empowed to keep arms away from convicted fellons , it does not have the power to limit them from citizens . Those people who `` you do n't know ( what they may do ) '' ? When the government is effective enough to prevent crime or has the power to do so , then we no longer live in a free society . Keep in mind that free choice also allows a person to decide to break the law . It cuts both ways , you can not take away the choice to break laws and allow good citizens truely be free . The only governments through history that have been effective in crime prevention has been tyranically communist countries with extensive secret police . The present people in former communist block countries today are sad to see thier streets full of crime , they recall `` back in the day '' how safe it way to walk down dark streets in saftey . Yes they were safe from criminals , they were not safe from the secret police . The moment the secret police eyed you for real or imagined statistical probability of breaking a crime or become a political enemy , you dissapeared and no one ever saw you alive again . The WMD analogy is poor . You will not find any vendors . Please find another one . There may be Constitutionally poor arguments in favor of banning WMDs for civilians , that argument is moot . You will not find any vendor . The Constitution protects my right to own arms . That does not mean arms vendors must be forced to sell thier product to me if I want one . That argument is moot . The Firearms Act decided that sawed off shot guns and the Thompson machine gun is to be banned from civilian ownership . Early Supreme court DECISIONS support this . Early judicial opinion of the the Firearms act was based on the fact that the Thompson and sawed off shot gun was not a military serviceable weapon and does not apply to the 2nd Amendment . The Thompson and sawed off shotgun were not used by the US Army . Guess what ? The Thompson was adpoted by the Army a few years later . So then , what does that mean ? Judicial opinion is of the direction that military serviceable weapons are protected by the 2nd Amendment . What does that mean for the assault rifle ban ? It means it is on shakey Constitutional ground . Some points I have for you : 1 ) Flash supressor ? Argued by anti-gunners prevent shooters from hiding thier position . Completely false . Flash hiders can hide flash from the target . It 's main purpose is to hide flash from the SHOOTER ! The flash startles the shooter and makes bullets ballistically unstable : `` Excessive muzzle flash happens when unburned powder ignites at the muzzle , causing turbulence behind the bullet with a detrimental effect on accuracy . '' - http : //www.shootingsoftware.com/loadens.htm Flash has more to do with the ammo than the attachment on the end . The Flash hidder ban has lowered target shooting scores more than protecting lives . 2 ) Magazine limit ? Argued by anti-gunners to save lives . Argued to prevent rapid and large expendature of rounds down range upon victims . True , but how often do you hear that ? When it does happen it is national news . The real threat is from guns that contain more 2 less than 4 bullets : http : //ip.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/2/151 The anti-gunners know this and are comming after your 6 shot revolvers next . They just wanted people to started getting used it to idea of banning bullet capacity . So then . The ban on more than 10 bullets ? It really does not do anything than give a false sense of security . If public policy productive and actally do something , then the ban on 10 bullets is a farce . 3 ) Bayonet ? I can not even fathom a reason to ban them other than emotional reasons . Simly because they look dangerous I suppose is why they are banned . Will someone please let me know ? Public policy should not be based on emotional reasons to be truely good and effective policy . 4 ) Pistol grip ? They make controling an automatic weapon easier to sight on your target . Well then , if you rifle is semi-auto , then what reason is there to ban them ?

You have to get to square one before square 2 . Society needs to come to grips with how it is going to view homosexuality before the law , absent from the philosophical issue is debated . You are getting the cart before the horse , so to speak . In essense , the so-called legal issue needs to be debated at least in the context of many of the above-mentioned things ( HIV , health , etc . ) , better yet after society decides how it will view homosexuality .
We 've had plenty of people claiming that being on the no fly list , or the suspected terrorist watch list , should be all the criteria necessary for denying a person the right to buy a gun .
Are you suggesting that if abortion were banned that abortion clinics that are already done will flood the US ? Please , get real here . People would probably go across the bordor and get abortions there ... you might have drugs from canada come over that cause abortion but there is no reason to believe this will `` clog '' up the jails . People need to realize that is was only 30yrs ago that abortion was pretty much illegal ( in most states ) . Did you see prisons flooded ? no .

I 've new to this site and everything and have spent a lot of time going through the abortion forum because I 'm about to have one and am curious as to what people are discussing . It seems that a lot of people have very strong opinions on abortion , but that 's about as far as it goes , opinions . Has anybody on this forum ever had any experience with abortions ? Ever had one yourself or know someone who had gone through it ? Just curious as to how many people have gone through this traumatic event because I know that for myself , even being pro-choice , my opinions and views have changed . For instance , I do n't for a second buy into the bs that is `` a fetus is not alive or a human being '' . I know for a fact that the baby growing inside me alive , I just can not accept it at this time in my life . Thanks for your responses .
Why do you think they do n't answer the question . They obviously love to ignore you and then go off on a tangent , throwing you a little red herring to keep you busy .
Have you ever read Darwin ?
Are you asking for the text book answer on what I know to be true about God or are you asking what my behavior tells me that I actually believe about God ?
Maybe because your solution is government and their record in that area is abysmal . Medicare , Medicaid and VA healthcare are all broken . Perhaps if the government could fix them then they might be trusted to not screw up the total healthcare system .
Yeah , this really is true . I kinda wish that even pro-choicers would see that Roe vs Wade ( which have pretty much been eroded anyway ) was an illegally decided case . I actually had a dicussion with a very bright person who was an insane liberal from UNC the other day . He was studying law and actually admitted to me that roe vs wade was a poorly decided case . He even admitted that while he hates Justice Scalia that his way of operating the court is the correct one . Needless to say I was stunned .
You are correct . I did not know that S Africa had abolished the death penalty . No death penalty=no death penalty for firearms posession . S Africa has the most restrictive gun laws on the planet . They also have the highets murder rate in the western world . Just another example from the real world of why the gun control crowd are a bunch of illogical XXXXXX .
I think this is rather simple . There will be a decrease in volume or quantity of healthcare services . This will not include time of doctors who mostly tell their spport staff to do yet another test . So it will mostly include support staff , administrative staff , equipment manufacturers . They will not necessarily get paid less , there will just be fewer of them . Per person that is .

It seems to me that the pressure Man has placed on most all species of wildlife in every corner of the World as we simultaneously encroached on those ecosystems , that our development would have jump started their social development and creative genes in order for them to adjust to the effects we have had on their Natural Habitats .
In the fourth case , you would have declared the murder of Jesus Christ .
Another masterclass in point elusion . To be fair , there is some doubt as to whether it was ever identifed , so that may remain forever moot . The missing ingredient in Archie 's scenario , ( other than logic ) is of course that his black and white mindset leads him into describing the gun as a `` mere '' tool , resulting in his avoidance of the fact that it is also a facilitator , an efficient effective multiplier of an individual 's killing capacity , which is entirely dependent on the gun , as originally succinctly defined by Ozzy .
No . Anyone who sticks to beliefs that a god created the earth just 6,000 years ago is an XXXXX . People are free to believe that a god created the Earth billions of years ago though without deserving the `` XXXXX '' label .
Well you 've made a good point ; just because something is banned or made illegal does n't mean that it 'll have an affect on reducing the numbers .

Perhaps studies should be done to find out why women would disregard nature and have an abortion in the first place . It is completely abnormal for a woman to not want her child .

First Same-Sex Marriage Licenses Issued in DC - Towleroad , More than gay news . More gay men Thanks to yesterday 's Supreme Court ruling , marriage equality is headed to Washington , DC . Gay and lesbian couples were allowed to start applying for marriage licenses first thing this morning . The District of Columbia is now the sixth place in the US where gays can marry legally and the very first located south of the Mason-Dixon line , which is notable at least in its symbolism alone . Sinjoyla Townsend and Angelisa Young , partnered for 12 years , were the first couple to receive a same-sex marriage license . Young said that `` It 's like waking up Christmas morning . The marriage bureau was expected to bring in extra employees to help with the number of couples expected to apply for a license . Due to a provision in the law , marriages can not be held right away . Instead , `` three full days must pass between the day of application to the day that the license can be issued . '' So expect full marital bliss in Washington to occur on March 9 .

Well I think that the geology of the planet would influence everything . From religions to morals and scientific progression . Because long ago on our planet Europe not only thought the world was flat and they could fall over at the edge into an abyss but Europe generally did n't have knowledge of the Asian cultures until the silk road was active . If the asian and european cultures were not so greatly distanced from each other history would have been greatly changed to the extent that compared to our world would be pretty loopy
If a mother of a 2 week old baby decides that she is n't ready to be a mother , and sets her newborn child down in its crib and leaves it until it dies of malnourishment , is n't that murder ? And if that is murder , how can one argue that intervening with a developing baby is not murder ? To me there is no distinction between the two . Once fertilization has occured , we have a responsibility to do everything in our power to nourish the developement of that child .

Really , I think it he or she is . really , i do n't think it is a baby yet . I do n't quite get this . The whole point of my post was that researchers did not have any reason to get embryonic stem cells . how do you know ? maybe they do , but you 're just too close-minded to know . then again , i may be wrong , but ... . Perhaps you do n't get this . I want stem cell research . i can not describe how much I want . I do know some people that could really use these stem cells . I just do n't want researchers to harvest the cells from our children . Not only is it a sick and perverted way of medicene and science , but it does n't work . Embryonic stem cell research does not work . We have n't even dared trying to test them on humans yet . When we tested them on mice , the mice grew tumors and died . You see , I want the stem cells to come from our own bodies . the stem cells in our own bodies are called adult stem cells and they really work . In the first post , it states that there have been treatments for over 56 diseases . Embryonic stem cells have done nothing like this . Not to mention the umbilical cord stem cells have worked really well too . well , since the ubilical cord stems have worked really well , then how come the scientists and doctors are also doing embryonic stem cell research ? again , they have their reasons to . they wud n't choose 2 use the embryonic cells if they did n't have to . i 'm no science wiz , and a lot of the science stuff that i 'm saying might be wrong , but the rest of the stuff are the things that i 'm using based off of logic , and my knowledge . common sense , that 's wat it 's called . I 'm not like that . I could list a few hundred people that I know that are not like that .

Do pro abortion people support euthanasia as a reason for abortion ? Meaning for instance ... if after amniocentesis it is discovered that the child has down syndrome or if it is discovered the child will be born with no legs the previously hoping and willing parents decide to abort for this reason . Do pro abortion people support this ?

Responsibility would be easy - whoever was adopting it , its not hard I 've been told to find adoptive parents for babies and if you have up to 9 months to do so then its even easier . However I think the cost of the units means they would still only be used where abortion was not possible - say the fetus had developed past the allowed abortable age ( so for me that means a functioning brain ) . Its not going to be possible to transfer every potential abortion to the womb unit , at least not or a very long time .
And what of when you go by some moral standard to determine what is right and wrong in other peoples ' lives as well ? What ? you do n't do that ? Bull . You ca n't tell me you never have an opinion or judgment on anything anyone else does . But by your logic , that would be imposing on them . Sorry , that dog just does n't hunt . Everyone has some basis for the views they have about they way they think society would be best . There 's no law that says people ca n't participate in that process with religion or anything else as their moral basis . 'Imposing religion ' is not the same as using religion as a basis , and it 's the fact that you are wrong on this that 's why religious people are continually able to have religion as their basis of social change , just as equally as anything else .

The University of Tennessees newly announced policy banning all gun ownership by student-athletes is an extreme overreaction to the criminal acts of a few . UTs athletic director , Mike Hamilton , said that under the new policy , the university will automatically dismiss any student-athlete found in possession of a gun  even those with permits and even those living off-campus . This over-reaching policy prevents law-abiding UT student-athletes from hunting and engaging in recreational and competitive shooting . More importantly , it also prohibits them from owning a firearm for self-defense , a right guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution . Lets be very clear  anyone , student-athlete or otherwise , who commits a serious crime ought to be punished . But the law-abiding should not , period . Sports teach everyone that actions have consequences . Sloppy work in practice leads teams to defeat . Criminal acts lead to punishment . A quality team  on and off the court or field  is what Vol fans want . That is not achieved by depriving students  athletes or not  of their civil rights .

The real question is , are humans of a different nature than apes ? If not , then a strictly evolutionary view of human origin makes sense .

You are so right-on in what you say ! In a Sunday school at a church I formerly attended , an elder of the church remarked that his `` faith was strengthened '' by the `` evidence '' afforded by recent archaeological discoveries in the middle east . In a tone I now rather regret , I blurted out two things ... ... How weak was your faith before ? and ... If the `` evidence '' had gone 'the other way , ' would your faith then have been weakened ? His answer for the second question was a simple 'no , ' which suggests to me that the sense of the term 'evidence ' he was employing was not the same sense you 'd expect a scientist to use . His response to the first was problematic , and interesting . `` My faith , '' he said , has always been -- then he used the most interesting word -- '' complete . '' But he had taken sufficient offence already , it seemed , that I pressed no further . I wish sometimes that I 'd asked : If your faith was `` always complete , '' did the archaeological evidence make it `` more complete '' ? And , if so , does your sense of 'complete ' match that word 's usual application ? I do not quite grasp the notion of there being `` scientific evidence '' for a proposition within the realm of faith . I do not mean to suggest that my claim that scientific and religious propositions reside in different discourses disposes of all worry or complaint . Activity in one realm may be felt in the other . But , re : evolution , I think this ... Given convincing evidence that , say , the earth is billions of years old , not thousands -- a mound of evidence more than high enough for my needs -- my worry is not that the 'Biblical account ' of creation is wrong , erroneous , falsified ... but rather is the quite different worry of wondering what , now , that account 's meaning is , what it affirms . Scientific discovery , evidence , and discourse thus do n't `` disprove the Bible . '' Rather , they serve to displace interpretations of biblical text , and give us cause -- I call it : opportunity -- to find new , richer meaning in scripture . I 'm often embarrassed by the smallness and brittleness of certain Christians ' interpretations . Emphasizing the 'literal , ' as some do -- a very problematic term in itself -- some Christians see in , for example , the Genesis `` tree of the knowledge of good and evil '' nothing more than a tree . A biological tree . Pear tree . Peach tree . Apple tree . Tree of the knowledge of good and evil . Albeit a special species , nonetheless a species . And , for them , there you go -- Eve chowed down on the fruit of a proscribed species , and that 's your story . Lost , in the insistence upon and closing of that interpretation , is the richness of metaphor the story offers . Metaphor , again and again , is variously deliberately denigrated or unconsciously eclipsed , in the readings of certain Christians . Science is not the only victim of such cheesily 'literal ' interpretation . Christian faith -- at least , the possibility of a rich faith robustly aware of its own weight in metaphor , parable , legend and myth , and the transformative power that arises from those aspects of scripture -- is equally victim . I feel more sadness about such a limited believer 's faith than I do about that person 's science . Master_Shake , for your poignantly apt remark -- '' what they have is n't faith at all '' -- thanks . Bless you ! Brad

I 've never quite understood why so many gay rights advocates give such leeway toward Democrat candidates . Here we have one flat out saying they do n't support gay marriage . Yet as usual , the only ones being criticized for it are the Republicans , and the DNC candidates are getting a pass on it . It seems to me that the real news here is that Biden , the Democrat nominee with gay special-interest constituents , so emphatically came out against gay marriage at that debate . But of course , we are n't hearing any of that from the gay press , who ( as usual ) are giving their candidates a free pass . Why are n't they demanding Biden explain his emphatic answering of `` no '' to that question ? Why are n't they demanding that HE clarify ?
What astounds me is that those who favor abortion went through an identical development stage as the being they are condemning to death .
Most abortions are consentual , no one FORCED them to have consentual sex .

Gunman kills 15 in German school rampage - Europe- msnbc.com Well is n't that interesting . Germany has much stricter laws than America does when it comes to gun ownership , and their school shootings resulted in more death and devastation that Columbine . It 's funny in a way , because the country with the tighter regulations is seeing more killings on school grounds than America , even though our laws are n't as strict . I guess that means all the nonsense about `` more gun laws make people safer '' is nothing but bull .

DAVENPORT , Iowa ( AP ) -- Sen. Sam Brownback , who wants to champion social conservatives in the presidential race , said Tuesday he wants a Senate panel to re-question a judicial nominee who attended a same-sex union ceremony . Brownback , a Kansas Republican , said he wants Michigan state judge Janet Neff to testify about her role in the 2002 Massachusetts ceremony , her legal views on same-sex unions and her ability to be impartial if called upon to rule on such cases . Neff 's nomination to a federal district court is among a dozen or so now stalled in the Senate , a logjam in part due to Brownback 's questions about Neff 's attendance at a lesbian commitment ceremony . The Senate Judiciary Committee has already approved her nomination . Neff was traveling outside the country and could not immediately be reached for comment , said Chris Bockheim , her judicial assistant . Earlier this month , Brownback , a prominent opponent of gay marriage who is exploring a presidential run in 2008 , said he would lift the hold he put on Neff 's nomination if the judge agreed to withdraw from ruling on any court case involving the legality of same sex unions . http : //www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/12/ ... f=rss_politics Does n't this just REEK of hypocrisy and partisanship ? He wants to question this judge because she was PRESENT at a same-sex ceremony . I wonder if similar questions are asked of judges to ensure that they can remain impartial if they view homosexuality as a sin ... `` exploring a presidential run ... '' ? ? ? Sounds like yet another Republican attempt to garner votes off of anti-gay hysteria .

ToE says all animals descended from this creature and all the millions of body parts found in the animal kingdom must have formed over time by RMNS .
This is not a part of the argument , though . Whether or not the woman can or can not perform activities she wishes to do ( which is not the case in pregnancy , btw , or at least varies greatly according to the individual ) is irrelevant ; it deals with the moral question of disconnecting someone who will die if they are not connected with you . The argument is equally applicable no matter the womans mobility .
So my question is this : ...
http : //nytimes.com/2005/02/19/national/19catholic.html Catholic Group Receives 1,092 New Sex Abuse Reports By NEELA BANERJEE Published : February 19 , 2005 WASHINGTON , Feb. 18 - Roman Catholic bishops reported on Friday that they had received 1,092 new accusations of sexual abuse by priests as they released the second annual survey of the church 's procedures for handling and preventing such abuse by clergy and employees . Kathleen McChesney , executive director of the Office of Child and Youth Protection of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops , said the overwhelming majority of the accusations , which were made against 756 priests , concerned incidents that took place about 30 years ago . Twenty-two accusations of abuse were made by children in 2004 , and they were all turned over to the police , Dr. McChesney said . The findings were released on Friday by the national conference , which has hired independent auditors to assess the church 's response to the sex abuse scandals that exploded in 2002 . Dr. McChesney said the costs to the church had exceeded $ 800 million since 1950 . Last year alone the costs from settlements , therapy for victims and offenders , and lawyers ' fees came to about $ 139.6 million , according to the report . The 1,092 new accusations of abuse were made by 1,083 people , mostly men . Last year the bishops released an analysis conducted by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York , based on figures from bishops and religious orders , that found 10,667 minors had allegedly been abused from 1950 to 2002 . The actual number of victims will probably remain unknown because many people never come forward , Dr. McChesney said . `` We were n't surprised by the numbers because many people are still finding the courage to come forward , '' Dr. McChesney said , `` and the church is in a better place to accept those allegations . '' . . .

I think you 're being a troll , simone , but I blame the parents . I would never have gotten away with calling my mother a bitch . In fact I would n't have even gotten away with calling her by her first name , it was `` mom '' or `` mother '' . I also had work to do , and I did it or I regretted not doing it . Now half the kids in the U.S. do n't have chores and they call their parents names all the time and get away with it . Then you wonder why kids are so spoiled . A bit of common sense advice : do n't whine about problems , try to solve them . If you do n't have a solution , then do n't whine .

This discussion is kind of unrelated to abortion because a link between abortion being wrong and someone not helping another in need does n't exist . If you believe thief is wrong you do n't have to become a police officer to show this . To answer your question ... who knows , identifying the true problem is the start .
Your reasoning of the effects of abortion are correct . The liberals who see abortion as a normal , acceptable , right to choose abortion are aborting themselves into extinction . Reverence , and a love of life is not what motivates Muslims . The power of Islam is . There is nothing to indicate that Muslims `` love '' life . They 'll cut your limbs or head off for nearly any reason . They 'll remove your head with a hacksaw so to take the time for `` you '' the victim to enjoy the moment and to voice your opinion and video it for your family and countrymen to enjoy .
Personally I find it similar to taking the Saxon Chronicles litterally . The latter parts may be reasonably accurate , ( insofar as an official history can be ) but parts , in particular the start are pure mythology . Why should the Jews be regarded as any more reliable ?
Ah , how icky the hypocrisy smells . Louisiana Republican Senator David Vitter , one of the leading proponents of a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage , has just apologized for his `` serious sin '' after his phone number appeared in the records of a DC Madam who ran an escort/prostitution service . Vitter had this to say of his connection to the prostitution service : `` This was a very serious sin in my past for which I am , of course , completely responsible . Several years ago , I asked for and received forgiveness from God and my wife in confession and marriage counseling . Out of respect for my family , I will keep my discussion of the matter there-with God and them . But I certainly offer my deep and sincere apologies to all I have disappointed and let down in any way . '' During his campaign for the U.S. Senate , Vitter had been accused of going to a prostitute , a charge that he then vigorously denied . Now , of course , he 's been caught , and he admits it . Meanwhile , Vitter expressed strong support last year for a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage . He compared same-sex marriage to hurricanes Katrine and Rita . He said , `` I do n't believe there 's any issue that 's more important than this one . '' It is always amazing when the self-proclaimed defenders of supposedly traditional marriage , the politicians who bolster their campaigns by appealing to popular anti-gay prejudice , are exposed for the hypocrites they are . In this case , this conservative Christian who campaigned against gay rights just could n't keep his own pants zipped . And to make sure he got elected , he lied about it until he was caught .
So what 's your alternative theory , peddler ? You do have one , right ?
simple ... .many Christians have been deceived ... .just like Adam and Eve were deceived in the Bible .
You all are missing the point that the morning after pill is abortion ( or rather could be ) . It can still kill a human life on purpose .

May I also suggest to firearms owners , to carefully edit from their rhetoric , any mention of them personally owning firearms . Who knows when these forums are being monitored ?
No , I did n't make any official challange , I was just saying I would have liked it if our informal debate had been ... ... ... ..shall we say , easier to understand , less cluttered . A new , formal debate would do that , and I 'm willing . I do n't care if it 's me or you who proposes the resolution . I 'd like for it to be along the lines of what was going on in that thread , the teaching of creationism in schools , or faith as it relates to the origination of mankind . In the last debate tournament , they had a time limit of 5 days between posts , and the posters went quicker than that . Even with an unforseen problem which caused a delay , the whole thing went just 33 ? days start to finish . When there is a time limit of days , or hours , it can make things unpredictable because if one person posts early , then any kind of projections about when it will be done can be thrown off . Also , it could make the deadline for you fall on a Friday , which I 'm guessing would be bad for your schedule . My suggestion would be to simply set days of the week ( at midnight ? ) so that if one person posts early , it just gives his opponent that much more time . Is there no way you can post once a week , with your deadline being midnight on Sunday ? If you could do that , my deadline could be Wednesday night . I work sometimes long and unpredictable hours during the week , but I can guarantee after your Sunday post , I 'll have something up by midnight Wednesday . Then you would have untill the following Sunday . You would have 4 days , including two weekend days , to come up with yours , and I would have 3 weekdays . I think that 's more than fair . If you ca n't do that , then we would just have to make it one post for each of us every two weeks . It would take between 2 and 3 months to finish it up . A long time , but I 'm willing to do it . I 'll PM Billsco about judges , it could be a problem . I 'm co-operative , but not suicidal . It 's hard to find anyone who does n't have a pretty strong opinion about this subject . I realize it 's not supposed to matter in determining who best made his/her points , but it easily can . There are several here I just ca n't accept as a judge for this kind of topic . Other comments or suggestions , anyone ?

It is easy to look at such a vote and quote the slogan `` a government by the people and for the people '' . But realistically , a government by the people is not necessarily a government for the people , in fact , it rarely is . Such government is only for the people if the majority votes in a fashion that is in the best interest of the people , which it generally does not . A system of government by the people ( democracy ) will rarely be for the people unless the power of the majority is checked . On the state level , it largely is not checked . A government by the people almost always creates tyranny of the majority if the majority 's power is not held in check . Democracy may be the best form of government to protect liberty , but pure democracy , majority rule , will be the first to destroy it .
The evidence is adequate for me and for much of the world 's population ... even many scientists ( including evolutionists ) .
The National Guard interpretation of the militia is totally false . The NG is a standing army . The militia is not . The NG can be federalized . The militia can not . They wear the same uniforms . The officers all know each other and play golf together . If the NG is the militia , then I want to have stock plies of weapons at schools , hospitals , libraries , and churches . No federalization of NG . Complete and total seperation of NG from federal influence , communication , and socializatlion , right down to even different uniforms .
Sometimes the state of the education system in the USA makes me cry .
yea but ToE does n't say mammals evolved from sponges -- it says we evolved from reptiles .
Then I would consider living in a different neighborhood , because if that many kids are getting shot , they are gang members , because outside of gang members , according to statistics , it does not happen that often , and certainly not in one area . As far as why I was looking down the barrell of an assault rifle , it was the result of road rage .
So much safer .

Oh silly MarieAntoinette or whatever name you are using these days . You got us though ... every pro-life person is a right-wing white male who hates blacks people and wants to enslave the female sex . Dang , we ca n't get anything past you !
I do n't think anyone here that I know of has argued that monogamy does not help against STDs .
Change Nobody Believes In A bill so reckless that it has to be rammed through on a partisan vote on Christmas eve . Mr. Obama promised a new era of transparent good government , yet on Saturday morning Mr. Reid threw out the 2,100-page bill that the world 's greatest deliberative body spent just 17 days debating and replaced it with a new `` manager 's amendment '' that was stapled together in covert partisan negotiations . Democrats are barely even bothering to pretend to care what 's in it , not that any Senator had the chance to digest it in the 38 hours before the first cloture vote at 1 a.m. this morning . After procedural motions that allow for no amendments , the final vote could come at 9 p.m. on December 24 . Even in World War I there was a Christmas truce . The rushed , secretive way that a bill this destructive and unpopular is being forced on the country shows that `` reform '' has devolved into the raw exercise of political power for the single purpose of permanently expanding the American entitlement state . An increasing roll of leaders in health care and business are looking on aghast at a bill that is so large and convoluted that no one can truly understand it , as Finance Chairman Max Baucus admitted on the floor last week . The only goal is to ram it into law while the political window is still open , and clean up the mess later . *** & # 8226 ; Health costs . From the outset , the White House 's core claim was that reform would reduce health costs for individuals and businesses , and they 're sticking to that story . `` Anyone who says otherwise simply has n't read the bills , '' Mr. Obama said over the weekend . This is so utterly disingenuous that we doubt the President really believes it . The best and most rigorous cost analysis was recently released by the insurer WellPoint , which mined its actuarial data in various regional markets to model the Senate bill . WellPoint found that a healthy 25-year-old in Milwaukee buying coverage on the individual market will see his costs rise by 178 % . A small business based in Richmond with eight employees in average health will see a 23 % increase . Insurance costs for a 40-year-old family with two kids living in Indianapolis will pay 106 % more . And on and on . These increases are solely the result of ObamaCare & # 8212 ; above and far beyond the status quo & # 8212 ; because its strict restrictions on underwriting and risk-pooling would distort insurance markets . All but a handful of states have rejected regulations like `` community rating '' because they encourage younger and healthier buyers to wait until they need expensive care , increasing costs for everyone . Benefits and pricing will now be determined by politics . As for the White House 's line about cutting costs by eliminating supposed `` waste , '' even Victor Fuchs , an eminent economist generally supportive of ObamaCare , warned last week that these political theories are overly simplistic . `` The oft-heard promise 'we will find out what works and what does not ' scarcely does justice to the complexity of medical practice , '' the Stanford professor wrote . & # 8226 ; Steep declines in choice and quality . This is all of a piece with the hubris of an Administration that thinks it can substitute government planning for market forces in determining where the $ 33 trillion the U.S. will spend on medicine over the next decade should go . This centralized system means above all fewer choices ; what works for the political class must work for everyone . With formerly private insurers converted into public utilities , for instance , they 'll inevitably be banned from selling products like health savings accounts that encourage more cost-conscious decisions . Unnoticed by the press corps , the Congressional Budget Office argued recently that the Senate bill would so `` substantially reduce flexibility in terms of the types , prices , and number of private sellers of health insurance '' that companies like WellPoint might need to `` be considered part of the federal budget . '' With so large a chunk of the economy and medical practice itself in Washington 's hands , quality will decline . Ultimately , `` our capacity to innovate and develop new therapies would suffer most of all , '' as Harvard Medical School Dean Jeffrey Flier recently wrote in our pages . Take the $ 2 billion annual tax & # 8212 ; rising to $ 3 billion in 2018 & # 8212 ; that will be leveled against medical device makers , among the most innovative U.S. industries . Democrats believe that more advanced health technologies like MRI machines and drug-coated stents are driving costs too high , though patients and their physicians might disagree . `` The Senate is n't hearing those of us who are closest to the patient and work in the system every day , '' Brent Eastman , the chairman of the American College of Surgeons , said in a statement for his organization and 18 other speciality societies opposing ObamaCare . For no other reason than ideological animus , doctor-owned hospitals will face harsh new limits on their growth and who they 're allowed to treat . Physician Hospitals of America says that ObamaCare will `` destroy over 200 of America 's best and safest hospitals . '' & # 8226 ; Blowing up the federal fisc . Even though Medicare 's unfunded liabilities are already about 2.6 times larger than the entire U.S. economy in 2008 , Democrats are crowing that ObamaCare will cost `` only '' $ 871 billion over the next decade while fantastically reducing the deficit by $ 132 billion , according to CBO . Yet some 98 % of the total cost comes after 2014 & # 8212 ; remind us why there must absolutely be a vote this week & # 8212 ; and most of the taxes start in 2010 . That includes the payroll tax increase for individuals earning more than $ 200,000 that rose to 0.9 from 0.5 percentage points in Mr. Reid 's final machinations . Job creation , here we come . Other deceptions include a new entitlement for long-term care that starts collecting premiums tomorrow but does n't start paying benefits until late in the decade . But the worst is not accounting for a formula that automatically slashes Medicare payments to doctors by 21.5 % next year and deeper after that . Everyone knows the payment cuts wo n't happen but they remain in the bill to make the cost look lower . The American Medical Association 's priority was eliminating this `` sustainable growth rate '' but all they got in return for their year of ObamaCare cheerleading was a two-month patch snuck into the defense bill that passed over the weekend . The truth is that no one really knows how much ObamaCare will cost because its assumptions on paper are so unrealistic . To hide the cost increases created by other parts of the bill and transfer them onto the federal balance sheet , the Senate sets up government-run `` exchanges '' that will subsidize insurance for those earning up to 400 % of the poverty level , or $ 96,000 for a family of four in 2016 . Supposedly they would only be offered to those whose employers do n't provide insurance or work for small businesses . As Eugene Steuerle of the left-leaning Urban Institute points out , this system would treat two workers with the same total compensation & # 8212 ; whatever the mix of cash wages and benefits & # 8212 ; very differently . Under the Senate bill , someone who earned $ 42,000 would get $ 5,749 from the current tax exclusion for employer-sponsored coverage but $ 12,750 in the exchange . A worker making $ 60,000 would get $ 8,310 in the exchanges but only $ 3,758 in the current system . For this reason Mr. Steuerle concludes that the Senate bill is not just a new health system but also `` a new welfare and tax system '' that will warp the labor market . Given the incentives of these two-tier subsidies , employers with large numbers of lower-wage workers like Wal-Mart may well convert them into `` contractors '' or do more outsourcing . As more and more people flood into `` free '' health care , taxpayer costs will explode . A Reckless Health Care Bill That Nobody Believes In - WSJ.com
Sarah Brady is a straw purchaser then . She knowingly broke the law by buying a gun for somebody else instead of letting them go through the NICS check system . Who knows what else she 's done and who she 's supplied guns to .
What 's this to do with Gun Control ?
Stick to your guns Doc for about Finland you know s**** The Finns were de facto allies of Nazi Germany , out of necessity , during the war .
I have been asking that for 10 years now and get a lot of different answers Haaa Haaa When you can find someone that is lodgical about the subject you will find out but until that time it is like looking for a needle in a hay stack .
The point should be made that explicit selection for EM seems to necessitate both the occurrence of codon reassignments and group selection to generate and select alternate codes . The proposal that explicit selection for the EM did not occur , and that EM arose neutrally from the addition of similar amino acids to similar codons , may be termed the Nonadaptive Code Hypothesis , in contrast to the Adaptive Code Hypothesis . Finally , on a fundamental level , as a result of the analyses presented here , the presence of EM in the SGC may be used as evidence that enzymes , whether partially proteinaceous , RNA based , or based on some other macromolecule , were already extant during the evolution of the SGC .
However , in another thread you talked about `` proof '' of science . Talking about `` proof '' and science in the same sentence is pretty much a creationist thing . When one asks for or claims proof of a scientific theory , it is a pretty good sign that we are dealing with a scientific illiterate . Science does not prove , it explains . Proof is a matter of mathematics and booze .
The very armed forces which the terminally paranoid seek to deter with their personal popguns recently rolled unstoppably through a sovereign nation which had defence forces who were infinitely better armed and trained than joe sixpack with his squirrelgun on a rack in the back of his pickup . They paused only to let the logistics catch up ! Please do n't strain our credulity with this mythic nonsense . In the vanishingly small likelihood of the event ever coming down down to it , your handgun is not going to face them down or give them a moment 's pause on any measure . They would squash you like a bug , and barely notice .
I do n't debate long , rambling philosophical nonsense .
All you have shown is that today we could n't this . You forget that Noah got the design from God .

Pregnancy is ALWAYS physically harmful . You try carrying a load of extra weight about and see what that does to your heart . It is also always life threatening - women still die from it and you never know how childbirth is going to go .
Yet to the woman the fetus is nothing more then cancer . The fetus is in her body and still should remain HER choice . Until someone comes up with a way for a fetus to live outside the body , without help , then it is nothing more then cancer and a parasite on the womans body . How about a compromise on this issue MEN should not have a say or decision about abortion and we all leave any legal desions to women . Since this is a womans issue let them decide and males but out .
*interupts debate for a second* Yay ! Welcome .
Why does n't this apply to Soviet Russia - which had a population of similar size ? Presumably , your answer would be that the USSR was less `` developed '' than the US ?

No way . No friggin ' way . *Majorly ticked* The Goverment ca n't intrude on your life like that . What 's next , they do and they have to have a forced abortion ?

So where did we come from ?
I disagree with this one though . They worded it in such a way to prevent the state from recognizing civil unions for gay couples . I think they should have left that in .
The study you linked us mentions that the BST method required follow up visits , to ensure that the teachings actually stuck . There 's no such mention with the Eddie Eagle program . Why ?
We are n't defending guns . We 're defending the right to be armed .
I understand how elvolution works and all but how can they teach it like a fact in schools when its really just the `` Theory '' of `` evolution ? its just like electritity noone can see it but they teach it in all the schools just cause some scientist believes in it . i think thats just plane dumb , if you ask me , more peeple believe in Jesus and a few have even seen him so right there its more believable then evolution which was invented a couple hundred years ago by some elitist sientist . so why not teach about jessus in the schools since we know more about him , and have actual facts that were written down by people who knew him eg . `` The Bible ! '' plus correct me if im wrong but i think theirs some stuff in there about how man 's kind came to exsist .
I disagree as all drugs being legalized would surely be a danger to society . As for weed , I think it should only be legalized if every other country ( or most ) does it . Why ? Well , have you ever been to amsterdam ? It sucks . I would hate to be like that .
We hicks just do n't understand . And obviously , us rural Christians are in the dark because our brains just arent as fit or as well-wired as evolutionists brains are  which is why theyd just assume wed all be unselected so they can do all the thinking .
It really piques me when someone attempts to assume what my opinion is without asking me . You know nothing about me or my views .
So you agree that it 's not necessary to have high capacity magazines because gun owners can reload quickly when defending themselves against a criminals . Good we can agree on at least one thing .
We have coyotes just outside the yard almost every night . Solo to packs of 10 or more . The males go about 40lbs or thereabouts . The females are used as bait to lure dogs . Dangerous predators ? For dogs and cats maybe . The dingo ate my baby ?
youre more concerned about those 22 to 30 thousand gun laws but Im more concerned about the 22 to 30 thousand lives taken by gun violence each year
I believe that abortion stands it best chance at being reduced by addressing the things that lead to unplanned pregnancy and the reasons women choose to abort . To demonize women and simply take away choice without addressing these things will not reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies , or gauarantee responsible choices . It will lead desperate women to desperate action , though ( i.e. , coat hangers ) .
Removal of body parts by whatever means does not change the dna of the rest of the body . The sperm cells and eggs are not affected by the loss of unrelated body parts .
I might start another thread , and change the subject to : I 'm Not Dumb Enough to Be an Agnostic ! Oh well , at least it represents a more illectually honest position than Atheism !
Yes and the continents moved about 2000-3000 miles in less than 4000 years only about a mile per year . Surely nobody would have made a note of that its such a slow rate of progress ! Clearly this is all possible with plate tectonics et al . Thats only about 15 ft per day of movement !
We are going downhill genetically . This is true for individuals and this is true for the population . And the reason for this is because humans are consistently deteriorating and degenerating from the high rate of mutations .
It seems to me the corollary of the phrase `` abortion is murder '' is `` miscarriage is manslaughter '' , and that any consistent pro-life advocate must urge any mother who accidentally loses her child due to actions she undertook , be charged with manslaughter . I wonder , is this actually the case ?
Most pro-abortionists I 've met have said yes , however I 'd like to make sure .
I have read the opinions and conclusions reached in several internet entries and I can see how they would largely persuade someone to think that the side-by-side dinosaur and human prints in stone do not exist . However , before you reach a personal conclusion , I would really recommend you visiting the site . Awe is not strong enough to describe the feeling that overcomes you when you personally witness this . I have been there and felt the chill when I saw what could only be prints of very old humans co-existing with dinosaurs . There is hardly a rebuttal that works when one is personally exposed to such an odd and even eerie site . The heel marks are clear as are the arches and in many instances , the toes . Before the naysayers offer a rebuttal , I think a visit to the Paluxy River around Glenrose might be in order . When you do , I think you will agree that there really is nothing like it . You might even revise your opinions regarding order and origins of life .
Sorry for the long delay between posts lol . This is a great story from QLD my neck of the woods Four to stand trial on murder charges | Australia Crime | Robberies , Assaults and Convictions in Australia | Finda This was just shown on ACA with the brothers and wife telling their untold story What they did not tell you is that both brothers were torchered for hours . What is the best part of this story though ? Once they phoned the police saying their dad had just been shot and was dead and the men were coming after them it took the police 9 HOURS TO RESPOND ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 9 HOURS , Not minutes HOURS ! But since these victoms were not allowed to own a gun to protect themselves they were actually much safer !
Not really . That 's the fallacy of exclusion of the middle . Because there are only two choices , if one is wrong somehow , the other is therefore correct . The problem is that there is n't only two choice for sure . Besides , science is wrong all the time , it does n't prove that creation is right . In fact , for instance , science estaimtes of moon dust have been proven wildly wrong , and those corrections actually harm creation .
I do n't walk into a building and say , `` Wow , look at what came out of the explosion at the brick factory ! '' That would be utterly ridiculous .
`` After all , it 's the job of the gun lobby and gunmakers to get as many guns into the hands of as many people as possible . It 's everyone else 's job to clean up after their mess . '' Too true !
Lastly and most importantly the prevalence of guns in general makes criminals far more likely to go armed , which raises the chance of you getting shot .
I am primarily interested in seeing how the creationists wriggle around this one .
Evolution may not , but most evolutionists do .
The real `` payoffs come from 2 sources -- the understanding of inheritance that grew out of Mendel 's inheritance theory , and the concept of dynamic systemic 'adaptation ' , as opposed to passive particulate 'selection ' , in evoltion .
Let 's assume that Creationism ACTUALLY happened . Ignore the problems of the flood , etc and state what should exist under such circumstances , not the problems and illogicalility of it all What should the world look like with the very different set of phyics , chemistry and biology principles ? What kind of plants and animals could survive the flood . What kind of sediment layers should we see ? What kind of tetonic plate speeds ?
One is right the other wrong . It can not be both ways .
Second , in this very thread Arch has deliberately tied the two as one . There are at least three posts here where he has just done that . You 'll notice right off the bat , despite a distinct clarification of YEC , and NOT Christanity as a whole , that Arch deliberately takes the discussion on YEC as a discussion on Christanity . Notice that the only person who argued the thread from a Christanity as a whole view was Arch . The rest of us deliberately stated otherwise .
Actually a lot of this work is done by European and African scientists ( If you do n't know where they are , look on an a globe ( or an atlas if you ca n't cope with the spinning ) ) , so attacking American scientists kinda shows how ignorant you are .
Also , I do n't believe future generations ( school children ) are having the gaps in godless evolution explained to them clearly enough .
This is what has caused such events as the Columbine Highschool shootings . The ones who did the murders did the shooting on Hitler 's birthday on purpose . One of them had the words , `` Natural Selection '' engraved on his shirt . They shot a girl because she believed in God , and a another guy because he was black .
The later of course can be eliminated as it does not fit the provable criteria of the question , and at the same time defies provable logic .
Matthew , I agree with you in this case . A constitutional amendment along these lines is a bad idea . Per George 's comment though I do n't see any problem with her taking a stance based on her religion -- all govt . officials operate off an ideology ( to varying degrees ) , that 's the way it works . She 's not instituting a religion , she 's conducting govt . ( or wanting to anyway ) based on what she believes . Church and state is n't being breached just because a religious person takes a given stance on a legal issue that they have religious convictions about .
There is nothing at all absurd about this take . The Gay agenda has been to normalize homosexuality and what better way to do it than to indoctrinate the young and desensitize them to the negatives of the lifestyle while they 're still impressionable . That way they know that within 20 years they will have normalized this abnormal lifestyle .
Why not ? There 's no rules that say faith and science must be separate .
The list with an unknown criteria for getting on , no disclosure so you know even if you are on it , and absolutely no way to get off of it .
Paranoia is so ugly . It 's not OK to teach scientific theory but it is OK to tell them that mythology is fact ?
Just answer the question . How to you account for the statements above ?
Actually , Dembski is known for his useless maths .
I never said that the majority of gun owners are racist . If you think that being compared to gay rights activists is somehow demonizing you then perhaps that shows how you feel about gay people . The issue is conservatives using liberal tactics to advance a conservative agenda .
According to the Old Testament , Sodom and Gammorah were destroyed because the rich oppressed the poor ( which is nearly an essential part of Capitalism ) , not because of homosexuality . According to the Old Testament , you must also murder people of different faiths in cold blood by stoning them to death , especially your friends and family .
Poll : Republicans Think Government Should Stay Out Of Medicare | TPMDC I think this sums up A LOT about the `` healthcare '' debate . Explains a lot why people are making ridiculous claims about `` death panels '' and the lot ...
Bigotry assumes many forms , hides behind many facades , but always it is the same ; the social demonization of entire groups , classes or races of people in an effort to make them appear inferior and detrimental by their very existence . In the wake of a nasty multiple shooting at a Pittsburgh , PA-area fitness club by a not-so-clearly psychotic man identified as George Sodini , America & # 8217 ; s gun prohibitionists & # 8211 ; led by the Violence Policy Center and Freedom States Alliance & # 8211 ; are clamoring for restrictions or repeal of concealed carry statutes . In the case against legally-armed citizens , the VPC has even manufactured an innuendo-riddled & # 8220 ; study & # 8221 ; to support their prejudices . My colleague , Cleveland Gun Rights Examiner Daniel White , writes about the shooting here . Their hardly subliminal argument appears to be that citizens licensed to carry concealed handguns for personal protection are a threat to the community . This contention is based on six shooting incidents over the past couple of years in which the gunman had , or apparently had , a carry permit . ... .
Ah , you 've engaged in the grammarian nitpick function of debate . Sad , but predictable . Obviously , I was discussing the entire article , which is making that argument . It is generally bad form to quote an entire post when it reaches such length .
Why do some of you guys insist on being rabid haters of anyone who cares about the enviroment . The question is n't why do these people care about the enviroment , it 's WHY DO N'T YOU ? ?
I do n't believe a right to personal autonomy exists ( and of the million times I ask where it comes from no one can give a real answer ) .
rich people can take away poor peoples freedom thats why marx was so important he showed us that goverment can be the great equaliser because if only government owns property then nobody will be rich and we will all be equal
If only people would do what is right , there would be no abortions and thus no need to debate this issue . If you percieve that others are not listening to you perhaps you need to take a look at yourself and what you are posting . Do n't blame me for your problems .
Hardly created equal .
I to have been wondering exactly how same sex marriages would pose a danger to male-female marriages . Ive never gotten an answer and I dont think anyone has one .
Among other things , the newborn must obtain its own oxygen and its own nourishment . It must also transition from an aquatic environment to an aerobic one .
Evolutionists may talk of actual selection as if it had a mind of its own and does the work of evolution on purpose
An interesting scenario . Let me reply with an example of my own . The top 5 % of wage earners pay over 30 % of all Federal Income Taxes in the US because the majority of US citizens supported higher taxation on the wealthy . Is that not similar to your scenario , except that in your scenario the blacks footed the bill and in mine the wealthy footed the bill ? But I digress .
Does anyone know a pregnant woman who has `` demanded '' an abortion ? Why is this horrificly false phrase bandied about so carelessly and freely ? It shows a grave disrespect for women who are making painful , soul-searching decisions about pregnancy . Why this great disrespect for women in this position ?
Now , my anti social side is pushing me to pass on a secret regarding AP rounds . If you want a REALLY good AP round , get a 7.62x25 ( tokarev ) . You can pick up a pistol for this caliber VERY cheap ( $ 200 or less for a good makarov ) . Hand load your rounds , but instead of using the 7.62 , order some .30 sabots . You can get them from a bunch of places ( just do a search for `` .30 sabot '' on google ) . They cost about $ 10 for 100 of them . Load your 7.62x25 with a fast burning powder , and you can load a heavier powder load . Use a .223 speer FMJ .
It is no more `` convenient '' to have an abortion as to have a child . It is no more painful to have an abortion than to give up a child .
I personally do n't know how exactly this world came to be , but if it was created , then I would like to compare it to buying a car .
Would you accept civil unions even though they were less then marriage ?
Why is this under the abortion section ? You see Prudence Lemokouno was a mother trying to give birth to a fourth child . Prudence Lemokouno was poor , she probably would never entertain abortion on her own flesh and blood . Poor people should'nt have to opt for abortion because they are poor , but the majority of the world , thinks that if you 're too poor , your not entitled to parenthood . The story above is about healthcare to the poor . Giving the poor access to good healthcare so they can have families , not destroy them .
And so there it is . Evolutionists fight and claw their way into people 's hearts by convincing them that evolution is a `` FACT '' -- - but it 's no more a fact than Republicans or Democrats claiming their political views are facts . If evolution was indeed a fact , it would not crumble so easily by a simple falsification .
This is a typical pro-choice scenario -- a rare one irrelevent to more than 95 % of abortions . Pro-choicers have to use rare examples to make their arguments appealing .
Mandatory storage laws are in violation of the Second Amendment because they interfere with personal defense , by making your defensive weapon inaccessible when you need it . I do n't care if you use the justification of it only applying when you 're not at home , that 's not good enough ; trouble can follow you home and attack before you can unpack your weapon now that you 're there . Then there 's the fact that mandatory storage laws serve no crime fighting purpose . Responsible people already lock up their guns , they keep them out of the hands of children and strangers , they do n't need a law to tell them to do what they 're already doing . Such a proposal takes away responsibility , it suggests that nobody is capable of being trusted unless everything is spelled out by federal law and carries strict penalties with it .
This Pauline gospel of a dying and rising savior bore unmistakable similarity to many of the Greek and Roman mystery cults which had similar stories . Pauls description of the eucharist as a Christian mystery lent further support to this view . But there were notable differences as well . ( Paths of Faith : Fourth Edition , John A. Hutchinson , McGraw-Hill , 1991 , p417 )
Besides , the amount of illegal abortions was not that many and you still did n't disprove my fact that we did n't have infants dumped on the side of the road all day long .
I do n't think there are many , who consider the fetus a person in the way you are implying , that are still for abortion `` rights '' . The debate is not if its ok to kill a human being because obviously your not going to get a huge debate on that but rather is the fetus a human being .
But apparently Bush was dating her . I do n't think on the medical form they ask who you are dating . And is there any actual proof that it was his child that he aborted ? I want to see the test results on that . If that is indeed true , it was a very big mishap for Bush . But I am not voting for him because he claims he is not pro-choice . I am personally pro-choice myself ( in certain cases ) .
The cut and thrust of peer review , in other words , a special interest .
Indeed . Many people do n't realize that the commandment is not `` thou shalt not kill , '' but `` thou shalt not murder . '' The important question then becomes , when is killing murder ? I have no doubt that God cares for the lives of fetuses . But I also have no doubt that God cares for the lives of pregnant women . The reason I brought up the Exodus passage is that it 's often taken to establish that abortion is murder , and that performing an abortion should be punished accordingly . But the passage is n't talking about abortion at all . Which just leaves us with the question of when it is or is n't acceptable to take a life , and the passage does n't provide guidance to that general question , either .
Just out of interest , which particular aspect of `` truth '' are you getting at here ?
Atheism does not show 'faithful devotion ' in any ultimate reality or deity . It is the LACK of a belief ( the belief in gods ) . Your definition of religion is thin .
Hmm ... seemed really cold this year ...
Sinjin is confused and chester is an , well you know . Both of them think if Obama is elected , that Obama is going to walk on water and feed the masses with three fish and a loaf of bread . I really got caught up in the fear of Obama taking my guns if he is elected , but then I got to thinking , if the economy is suffering now , how much of an impact would a gun and ammo ban make . If guns and ammo get banned then the manufacturers lay people off , and the economy takes two big hits right off of the bat , the loss of sales revenue and people without jobs cant spend money , so as I said , two big hits . Next , the economy would suffer a really huge blow , as all the money sportsmen and hunters spend annually would be lost now , I dont know the figures , but I would guess hundreds of millions of dollars , and thats not even counting plain old shooters . Then buisinesses such as cabellas , pro bas shops , academy , and thousands of others would have to lay off , and possibly shut down . Then there is the loss of revenue that goes to programs such as wildlife management , which will make the wildlife suffer greatly . And finally , the loss of revenue collected by the states who have carry concealed licsenses . I am sure that more than I posted would suffer , but it is all that comes to mind at the moment . Point is Obama can try to ban guns , but with such an economic loss from it , I doubt that congress would ever approve it .

Religious faith , by definition , is a `` jump in the dark '' and there is really little ( if any ) common intellectual ground on which Creationism and Scientific Materialism can meet . In principle , given adequate evidence etc. , there is nothing in the material world that can not be explained by Science . But someone who has , so to speak , already jumped into the dark can not see this . The most interesting questions that a supernatural account of human life can raise are concerned with the evolution of law , morality , social conventions , aesthetic sensibility and such like .

I was just following your logic to its ultimate logical conclusion . Liberals do n't give a damn about individual freedom ; they want governmental control over all aspects of your life . They want gov't control of healthcare because they think we 're too dumb to fend for ourselves . They want to indoctrinate our kids in school because they do n't trust parents to be parents . The list of liberal intrusisms into our lives is endless .
State-level governments are largely worthless , in my opinion . It is complete absurdity to allow Constitutions to be ammended based on the vote of the people .

So please do not ask questions where you know that people most likely ca n't give you a definite answer ( because no one knows it ) just to finally say that if Evolutionists ca n't prove it completely it most likely is n't true ... We all know that ourselves ... There are no real answers to any of your questions ... ( yet ) ...
While Wong [ 9 ] highlighted the precursor-product relationships between amino acids and their crucial role in defining the organisation of the genetic code , Miseta [ 10 ] clearly identified that the non-amino acid molecules that were precursors of amino acids might have been able to play an important role in organising the genetic code . Miseta [ 10 ] suggested the idea of an intimate relationship between molecules , the intermediates of glucose degradation , as precursors of precursor amino acids , and the organisation of the genetic code . This observation is also analysed by Taylor and Coates [ 11 ] who showed the relationship between the glycolytic pathway , the citric acid cycle , the biosyntheses of amino acids and the genetic code ( Fig . 1 ) and , in particular , they point out that ( i ) all the amino acids that are members of a biosynthetic family tend to have codons with the same first base ( Fig . 1 ) and ( ii ) that the five amino acids codified by GNN codons are found in four biosynthetic pathways close to or at the beginning of the pathway head ( Fig . 1 ) [ 11 ] . More recently , Davis [ 12,13 ] has provided evidence that tRNAs descending from a common ancestor were adaptors of amino acids synthesised by a common precursor and he also discusses the biosynthetic families of amino acids , suggesting their importance in genetic code origin .

No they were trying to not just find a singel gene but overall genetic causality in general . That is why there were so many studies . They have failed to find conclusive proof that sexuality of either type is geneticly derived . This in light of other behaviors is irrelevant . Handedness can also be learned , there is no proof it is geneticly derived or that it is n't but just because it is accepted as genetic does n't validate that assumption or assumptions for any other behaviors . The tendancy to be nervous or rape or commit other crimes may or may not be genetically related . So far they have no proof but would you say that a person genetically predisposed to anxiety is a positive benefit . The justification that something may be genetic makes it some how `` acceptable '' is invalid . It may alleviate the feelings that individuals have no responsiblity for control of certain behaviors but that does n't automatically mean those behaviors is a good or desireable thing . Let me ask you this ... If it were found out tomorrow that we isolated a cluster of genes that are responsible for homosexuality AND had the ability to remove said genes out of individuals , would you strive to ensure that homosexuality is genetically protected or would you support individuals re-engiineering their children to weed out such trait , which by wrote could render homosexuality extinct eventually ? Big question but an important one , because this is where I think alot of people are kidding themselves in this whole `` gene vs. enviroment '' debate . Were moving toward an era where we will be able to alter our own bodies on a genetic level , if there is the slightest iota of genetic homosexuality do you really think it will last through the `` splicer '' years . Cmon , you know it would n't and then gays would be fighting for legislation to make it illegal to genetically elimiate homosexuality and then where will we be .

So it 's just a coincidence that nations that ban guns like England have much lower levels of gun violence and murder than the US ? That 's kind of hard to believe . NYC was so effective in reducing crime that the mayor of NYC was invited to Mexico City to help them reduce crime there . So I do n't think the possibility that gun control has been effective in cities like NYC can be ruled out . You may be confusing cause and effect . You would n't walk into a hospital and declare that because there are a lot of sick people in a hospital that hospitals do n't help people get better .
First you need to be old enough to be able to legally own a weapon .
Nevertheless , I think the woman should have the choice..and she does . However , if she makes the choice to kill another human being we should punish her or whoever did it .

No wonder we here in the U.S. are complaining about the stead flow of narcotics and drug gang violence flowing from the Mexican Violent Drug Cartel . No wonder we are complaining that the Mexican authorities have been complicit , and even corrupt , taking this illegal drug money and for allowing this problem to get this big and this bad . Now the only way out of it is to blame me ?
Because self-government loses its meaning totally if the people are prohibited from amending their constitution by persons other than themselves . I really do not support rule by the very , very few .
Furthermore , the published work of Larry D. Martin et al. , A. D. Walker , J. M. V. Rayner , S. L. Olson , K. N. Whetstone and others ( all evolutionists ) indicate precisely the opposite of Isaaks assertionthat is , Archaeopteryx has far more bird-like characteristics than reptile-like characteristics .
Whcih is why , in order to get to at least some semblance of the truth , one must look behind the report to the publication where is appears . There are very few outside the hard right religious radical lunatic fringe ( SoC for example ) who give credence to anything NARTH puts out given their biases . I have yet to see one of these folks explain how allowing same gender couples to marry will negatively impact their own marriages .
I have already asked God for forgiveness and he has forgiven me .

City council vote only , not sure about public sentiment , but from what I gather , most people do n't care because they do n't own guns . Whenever an issue like this comes up , people who are interested seem to become the loudest , both the pro- and anti-gun crowds .
ID did not initiate a war for hearts and minds .
And what is your deal with lunatic fringe leftie ? Antigun laws are clearly not a fringe view , or gun control laws would not have been passed in Congress . You can hardly call the views lunatic .

You said in one post you are a ex-christian . If you new anything of Christianity you would know this is not possible . It is possible you had the title of Christian without the relationship which gives you this title . Christianity subscribes to the power of God to save you , not of any power of your own . If one could be come unsaved , he becomes more powerful than God ( Impossible within Christianity ) .
Well , ID is actually identical to 'scientific creationism ' , but spruced up with more scientific terminology to attempt to pass 'seperation of church and state ' . Let 's just say that I.D . is an attempt to teach Creationism in school .
As I understand , the Second Amendment was written as a protection against political tyranny . The Founding Fathers knew that the King of England had used a standing army to oppress the people in the past . The solution was a well regulated militia and to not limit arms ownership to those in the military .
The Associated Press reports that Appomattox County court records show a concealed weapons permit was issued to a Christopher Bryan Speight three times between 1999 and last year . The issue dates in 1999 , 2004 , and 2009 match the five-year renewal period for concealed handgun permits under Virginia law . The 11 prior mass shootings are detailed on the VPCs web site , Concealed Carry Killers ( VPC - Concealed Carry Killers ) , an on-line resource , updated monthly , that tallies from news reports killings by concealed handgun permit holders . Not including yesterdays shooting , the web site reports that since May 2007 concealed handgun permit holders have killed at least 117 people , including nine law enforcement officers .

( 1 ) Almost all people say they believe in equality , but the real truth is that throughout American history it has traditionally been liberals rather than conservatives who have fought for equal rights for African-Americans , women , religious minorities , and political dissenters .

I 'm against abortion but pro-choice . Whether the fetus is human is not something that I think is really relevant to the matter , and in any case where we give it the benefit of the doubt it is still permissable to carry out abortions in order to safeguard a woman 's autonomy .

Of course not , but I fail to see how atheists are using science as its god , can you please explain that to me directly ? Evolution does n't refute god at all . In fact with evolution , intelligent design is entirely possible . But that still does n't make it science .

Now look here , boy , I 'm tired of you spreading this ignorant bull**** . I came from the UK , I lived there most of my life , I saw the truth that you choose to ignore because it 's inconvenient for you . The police have been caught intentionally miscounting the number of crimes reported by the people , they 've been doing it for years . The people of the UK also do n't report every instance of when they 've been victimized . These two facts mean that any evidence you use to support your flawed position is untrustworthy and doctored to reflect whatever you want it to . You might as well be citing yourself ! Even one of the biggest advocates of the post-Dunblane handgun ban admitted that the ban was a huge failure , because even school children were able to get access to guns and kill their classmates . Do n't you ever spread this lie again , we know that there 's no ounce of truth to it ! And that 's coming from a former subject of the UK , somebody who saw it first hand !
It stops us from saying we ara a rational people . I do n't support any laws that would allow a father not to have a say so about his child being aborted . Are there any ? ? If it were a life or death thing for the mother no question . !

In this post I am also going to destroy Toe by showing that the Neandertals did not evolve their physical characteristics through random mutations and natural selection . Instead , they developed them Gods way  the intelligent way . Im going to weave all these things together to create a filthy collage that depicts what the theory of evolution really stands for . This post will tie everything together and will make more logical sense than any conveluted-writing Darwinist author ( Dawkins , Mayr , Eldredge and Darwin himself ) could ever dream of presenting . Not everyone is willing to say these things . But Im not afraid to speak my mind . I have an inner desire to uncover and expose the raw truth  of which evolutionists hate .

Who on earth worships the Koran ?
My point here is that it could be argued very reasonably as to whether or not a fertilized egg , a zygote , an embryo , fetus , etc. , is a Someone .
Even if you do want to make the argument , however , you have to look at the origin of life . Whether you want to admit it or not , creation is about exactly that . Creation . It all starts with God creating the heavens and the earth and Adam and Eve . We , creationists , believe that and admit that . My question is ... where does your 'belief ' start ?
There is a lot of that . Many mutations are recessive and a population over time accumulates a lot of genetic variation that can become useful if the environment changes . The founder population of lizards , for example , could have had at most , 20 alleles for any gene locus , since each lizard can only have 2 . The new ones evolved by mutation . Sometimes , we can even observe that happening , or trace the mutation back to a known ancestor . Would you like to learn about it ? .
Nor is there any need for some mythical molecular elemental , nebulas natural selection , or mystical transitionals based on peicemeal forensics and antithestic rhetoric .
Gravity is a fact because we can observe it 's effects on objects and we can do tests to determine more about it .
I do n't think that Paul was actively gay . He was so odd about having anykind of sex at all that it was pretty warped .
There 's a huge hole in evolutionary theory and Im about to exploit it . Ive mentioned this before , but truly , mountains of books could be written on this subject . The subject , of course , is the illusion of evolution . My contention is that much of what is perceived as evolution is not actually not evolution at all . Part of the problem 20th century scientists had was their definition of evolution. Intellectual wars have been fought for the past 150 years about where new traits come from and how they get passed on . Regardless , each side has tried to explain how the information from the environment gets transmitted to offspring . On one side you have Darwinists , who claim that evolution is a two-step process . First theres random genetic mutation , and thats followed up by non-random natural selection .the two combine to have the effect of transmitting environmental fitness to their offspring . Lamarckian inheritance , on the other hand , is a one-step process where the organism simply perceives the environment , adapts phenotypically and passes on these adaptations to their progeny . But theres a hole . A gaping hole that nobody has seemed to exploit . And this hole bypasses both theories . Whats the hole ? The hole is that inheritance of new traits is not necessary for evolution. In other words , populational evolution does not require traits to be `` passed on . '' This mantra is a giant straw man , as you will soon see , because much -- if not all -- of what we see in the field is merely a matter of environmental evolution . The reality is that a change in phenotype is observed as evolution in the field and in the fossil record . But there is no way to tell from the fossils -- or from non-controlled scientific experiments -- whether new traits are caused by variation arising in the genotype or only from environmental effects acting on the phenotype . Not only that , but theres also no way to tell without close inspection if these traits are inherited or acquired . Its well known that animal embryo development brings about a collaboration between the genetic program , internal signals from the mother , and external signals from the environment . Somehow the embryo processes this information and emerges accordingly . Therefore , the same genome can emerge with different phenotypes depending on environment or external circumstance . This is known as differentiation , and is simply the convergence of an organisms genes and environment during development . Moths and butterflies are perfect example of this phenomenon . As well , tadpoles can not only change the size and shape of their heads , it 's also known that the presence of predators can influence their tail size , shape , color , hatch times and general size of the organism . ( Could this be why Neanderthals had their brow ridges ? Since they had a slightly protruding face ( as many in Europe still do ) , the exertion that no-doubt came from eating a diet heavy in meat ( vigorous chewing ) could very well have put pressure on the facial plates and brow ridges -- and as youngsters with soft bones , this diet help dictate their morphology . ) But its not just tadpoles ... ... .. As well , rodents , will dine on a variety of seeds and nuts as youngsters , if a population of mice come across a new food supply , they are all likely to all develop a morphology that suits such a diet . If this food is different than what their parents ate , their morphology could be uniquely different than their parents . This new morphology would follow them until adulthood . If the food supply stuck around long enough time , it could give the appearance that the population was evolving. But genetics would have nothing to do with it  instead , it would simply be a cultural , environmental phenomenon . Its an environmental evolution , of sorts . Of course this leaves natural selection out of a job because the entire population would be evolving new , beneficial morphologies without it . Not only that but it bypasses the ridiculous premise that science has constructed for itself -- - which says that new , beneficial traits have to be passed on. This is a bogus premise from the very start because its not necessary for traits to be passed on for new morphologies to carry forward into future generations -- all that 's needed is , in this case , for a specific diet to continue to be available to future generations -- which , of course , would carry on those particular traits . `` We think licking affects a methylation enzyme that is ready and waiting for mother to start licking , '' Dr. Meaney said . In perilous times , mothers may be able to set the stress reactivity of their offspring by licking less . When there are fewer dangers around , the mothers may lick more . [ /color ] Really the skys the limit ; diet , terrain , movement , predators , weather , availability of resources , etc . Life is not about genes , Life is about life . The designer didnt create animals adapted to specific environments , He created them with an adaptive ability to evolve with a changing environment . This is not evolution its an adaptive response . Of course , some say new beak shapes could have formed during development , but either way , selection is not required ... .it would be similar situation to the butterfly example I gave above . This of course , is just another example where it is not necessary for traits to be passed on. Traits need not be passed on to give the illusion of populational evolution . And whats interesting is Goulds explanation for why Lamarckism is false ... this is very interesting and ties in directly to this : Of course , Gould has set up a giant straw man that has been repeated relentlessly . The straw man is that it 's not necessary pass on traits , for the reasons stated above ... .and it is not necessary that environments or acquired adaptations can direct sex cells to mutate in specific directions. Life gets around that little scenario because each life is individually adaptive ... and adaptations start during development -- where his eyes could n't see -- or did n't want to . Life changes so rapidly -- if you blink you miss it ! Stephen , I know youre dead , but if you can somehow hear me , please note you have made a great error ..you have a giant hole in your theory , which I have just exploited . Its called The Environmental Evolution Revolution. Not only have I undercut your snails but I 've undercut most of what you and all your foolish friends say in your books . Evolution surely has a heritable component , but a huge portion of what is perceived as `` evolution '' in the field is not that at all . It 's merely an illusion ... and upon close inspection it disappears altogether ... .just like your theory . You see , there is NO EVIDENCE for natural selection sifting through random mutations . What is seen in the field today is not evidence for that , it 's simply evidence that the environment is working on the genetic code of each creature .
When Christianity , or the Politicalzation of Religion has gone wrong , there is a standard , a moral standard , that declares this wrong . Consider , Nuremburg Trails , when the Nazis said , they were just answering to a higher authority and follow Party power , the judge declared , that they broke their own Laws , and they would answer to a HIGHER POWER - GOD . Case closed , we over road their relativism , or Nazis morality and condemned many to death .
But the creationists continue to attempt to impose their religion on others as science by the latest `` Intelligent Design '' movement . The ID movement is nothing more than creationism that attempts to avoid a mention of God . Once ID theory ( which is n't theory since it is not based on evidence and testing ) is allowed into the schools , then the next step will be to introduce the fundamentalist Christian god as the designer .

If we try to define that difference then things become murky . If we use attributes like intelligence , language , emotions , etc . which apes also possess then theoretically apes could evolve into beings of the same nature as humans . This difference must be of such a nature that other species do not have the building blocks to recognize the quality through evolution .

These last two cases are of course not the norm , but they indicate the wide-range of ideas that can be routinized by the judicious quoting of scientific authority .
As if we did n't already have enough `` missing links '' , along comes another : http : //news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4498049.stm Of course the creationist XXXXXX will claim it is n't a missing link , but what are we to expect from XXXXXX anyway ?
If information came into being by chance , how can we know that anything is true ? How do you know what is false and what is `` true '' ? If we are just products of chance , your brain is also a product of chance . Therefore , the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance . If your logic is the result of chance processes , you ca n't even be sure it evolved properly . You ca n't even be sure you can reason properly ( using your definition ) because you ca n't trust your own logic .
I think you could teach gun-control at a gun-free school , too . Sex-education is also taught in schools that forbid their pupils to couple on the school yard .

Mossberg Old .22Mag , currently at my parents house in PA. Do not have a clip for it , and i have never fired it . It was given to me in my grandfathers will . 5 . Marlin .22 LR Who cares what kind of ammo , it 's a .22 ! I usually buy Rem I think . 6 . Winchester 300 WIN MAG Model 700 Usually : 300 Win . Magnum 180Gr . Trophy Bonded Bear Claw ( Federal Premium ) -not a chance in hell i will wrte the serial numbers down here . Oh ... and DOOD is spelled Dude . And I was pointing out that these paramilitary militia types are what gives the anti-gun control argument a bad name . Good for the Koreans . You have the right to protect yourself , sure ... but some people take this to extremes . ( Maybe we will call them ... extremists..yeah thats it ) The people who stand up loudly screaming `` the only way you 'll ever get my gun is by to pry it from my cold dead fingers ... '' News for you . The way a lot of these militia types act , the general public fears them . This fear is doing more harm to the gun movement than anything else . I 'm not talking about someone who has a shotgun by his bed ready for John Q . Criminal to walk in , I keep my .40 by my bed . I 'm talking about anti-government militia types who think that they will one day be fighting Russians from their doorstep . You said something about my `` phobic rant '' ? Have you ever heard these paranoid people ?
Even one of evolutionists favorite examples for deliberate mutations , radiation , has a negative , degenerating effect on the crops it effected . Thus , once again , how could this possibly serve a vital role in evolution ? ? ? ?  which leads me to wonder why would they even bother talking about it in all their literature ? ? ? Deception ? Are they that starved for emamples ? : A huge number of small , sterile , sick , deformed , aberrant plants were produced . However , from all this effort , almost no meaningful crop improvement resulted . The effort was for the most part an enormous failure , and was almost entirely abandoned . Why ? It was because even with all those billions of mutations , there were no significant new beneficial mutations arising . Sanford This theory is intellectually dead . It amazes me that so many people are so in love with it .

God created the heavens and the Earth . thats all there is to it . You may think the Bible is not true because it was written by man . Well the Bible says it was written by God , through man . You may ask , `` Why is the Bible true and other religious books are n't ? '' Christianity is n't a religion ... It 's the truth . God created us and His Son came and died on the cross for our sins because he loves us ! That 's not religion . The Bible is Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth !

The lovely thing about our system of justice , is , if a citizen acts , his actions are judged for appropriateness , and if found to be unlawful , he/she must stand in a court of law an be held accountable for them . Brady on the other hand , wants to skip all of that justice stuff , and hang us all , just because we follow the Constitution and our laws , and dare to have the AUDACITY to actually believe in both , and own a Constitutionally recognized as Inalienable Right , gun ! So who is the law breaker here ?
In the explanation I gave to him , and now pass on to you , it 's akin to saying An elephant is a fish that lives on cheese . No amount of evidence will convince me otherwise . All 'proofs ' that you can show me are illogical . ?
But you are demanding that they CAN .
Theories change since they are just that - theories . Once time and sufficient investigation has given them sufficient weight , they become laws . Newton 's laws were derived to explain direct human experiences ( we deal with relatively large objects going at slow speeds relative to the speed of light ) and for that regime , they remain true . Since there were still a multitude of basic unanswered questions at the time in Science ( about light , the nature of matter , etc . ) , investigation continued and found , in the 20th century , the laws of relativity and quantum mechanics to explain occurrences outside of the range of the large and slow that we experience . At the beginning of science ( say ~17th century ) , there were a lot more questions than answers . Now , its the other way around - at least when it comes to the essential theoretical basis behind things that human 's experience .
I 'd find it interesting to discover how many of those 58,000 were looking at very long and serious sentences , but were given a plea deal for reduced charges .
Hey , on a thread like this its fair game . Insulting each other appears to actually be on topic in this case .
While I agree with the law , I do n't agree with your reason . By your logic we should just dump all laws as someone is always willing to break them . The reason to me is the great number of people who do it . The society itself has changed . The laws should be changed to reflect that . Up here in VT , something like 55 % of all residents admit to smoking marijuana on a regular basis . It still illegal , but people do n't report marijuana usage and cops do n't arrest people for it unless they a near a school or have enough to charge them with intent to distribute .
why do n't we just outlaw convenience abortions ?

First of all ... you are doing what evolutionists do best and that is to take things out of context .
Neandertals and humans are lumped in one `` kind '' by creationists . Elephants and mammoths are another `` kind '' . Now , if SS 's theory is true , neandertals will have the same DNA sequences as humans , because it is a matter what genes are turned on and when , not a change of genes . ( This is even more pronounced because creationists insist neandertals ARE members of H. sapiens ) . Same for mammoths and elephants . So now we look at DNA sequences . Are they the same ? NO ! Neandertals and H. sapiens differ by over 3 standard deviations from variation within H. sapiens populations . So , the consequences are wrong , therefore SS 's hypothesis is wrong . No assumptions involved . Only data .
zapping chemicals ... humbug . And where did the chemicals come from anyway ?

Well good at least you are aware there is no reason beyond your opinion of morality against gay marriage . So by all means do n't marry a man and the problem is solved .
I do not wish to appear to dispute this , but do you have a reference for this claim as it is very interesting ? Thank you .
I mean , we live in a Christian nation and we still kind of think , in our heart of hearts , that if a woman or girl is raped IT 'S HER FAULT .
Let 's assume that Creationism ACTUALLY happened . Ignore the problems of the flood , etc and state what should exist under such circumstances , not the problems and illogicalility of it all What should the world look like with the very different set of phyics , chemistry and biology principles ? What kind of plants and animals could survive the flood . What kind of sediment layers should we see ? What kind of tetonic plate speeds ?
He had a gun and believed the rightwing lies . He was just a little more credulous and paranoid .

[ Brain size is relevant compared to the rest of the body - its the proportions that matter . If you 're small then you can have a smaller brain , this contradicts evolutionists ' position . They have long measure brain size and correlated it with intelligence . Take homo erectus , for example . Evolutionists have long said homo erectus was some sort of sub-human because of the size of his brain . It does n't matter that Turkana boy was short at about 5'5 and 10-13 years old -- and that his head size did not look proportionally small -- today 's scientists do n't care about any of that . They just measure his skull .
IT 'S ALL LEGAL !
None of these players are in God 's favorite line-up of people : Nebuchadnezzar , Tyre , Egypt . He has determined judgments on all players in this game . Tyre is first to receive the penalty of her errors and God sends Nebuchadnezzar to lay a siege against her . In judging Tyre , God also judges Nebuchadnezzar . Not all of the prophecies against Tyre are fulfilled because God changes his mind about his immediate judgment of the city . He is not under duress to give us his reason why , though you can be sure of this : he completely fulfills his words against the wicked city at a later time . Like a puppet under his control , he turns the heart of Nebuchadnezzar toward Egypt and placates him through the words of the prophet by saying that he will pay the king back for his hard work which ended in frustration . Never in the text does Ezekiel `` admit he was wrong '' as you believe or in any way accuse God . The prophet utters a lengthy judgment against Egypt and the king turns his wrath toward that southern country . He labors hard to conquer it but he does not succeed . God has again changed his mind for the immediate time for reasons we do not understand . God will fully bring his predictions against Egypt to pass at a later time . In the end , three entities are brought low , wasted , assets evaporated , judged : Nebuchadnezzar , Tyre , and Egypt . God has had his way with them . Ezekiel never `` admits he was wrong '' and he never accuses God .
South Dakotans say `` repeal the extreme abortion ban ! '' Thanks to the hard work of 1,200 volunteers in 138 different cities and towns -- in nine weeks time -- we filed petitions with the names of more than 38,000 South Dakotans who are calling for the repeal of the extreme abortion legislation enacted by the South Dakota legislature and signed into law by Governor Mike Rounds on March 6. http : //www.sdhealthyfamilies.org/
I know for sure that ... many other religions do not fit in to well with the agriculture , astronomy , biology and geology that we observe .
Well , criminals are per definition those who break the law and the law is what you make of it . If private fire arms where illegal , those who would carry a firearm without proper license or permision would be considered criminals . Civil unrest , when turning into violence , is often something bad ...
Over time , you may get a population of wingless beatles - the adaption would be mutation by natural selection . Not evolution . Which also fits beautifully with the creation account .
How long idd the theory of spontaneus generation hold prevelance before somebody actually challenged it scientifically ?
I 'm just trying to correct . sorry if i had offended u .
so thats quite contradictory to me ... you would allow a law that killls millions of innocent babies a year and get rid of a law that rightly carries out the law ... wierd sounds like a liberal to me .
What a traitor !
God uses genes as our program , we become what our genes say . Genes do n't change into something new !
Let me get this straight , billions and billions of yrs ago nothing exploded , and from that explosion what we got was instead of absalute kaos complete order , and from this order we went from being frogs to becomeing princes and princesses ? .. Cmon people think about it ! ! Until some one can come to me and provide me something out of nothing that reflects the perfect order in which nature displays today , we all know were we can stick the evolution theory ! ! !
On top of that , what we accomplish with our bigger brain is , as I 've already demonstrated in other threads with reference to feral children , greatly dependent upon the accumulated wisdom imprinted upon the brain during infancy . We teach our children to problem-solve . We teach them language and abstract thought - we train the various parts of the brain to do their job properly . We are n't born 'complete ' . Even as adults , not everyone is equally quick-witted , not everyone has an equal facility for logical thought - and this has a lot to do with how their brain has been trained during its development .
I ca n't think of any experiment to test ID so I ca n't think of any variables in that experiment .
So much for lists of registration and `` safe storage '' . Same thing happened when Hitler took over a country and got hold of all the lists . They were especially interested in the gun lists and radio lists .
After reading some of the posts on the gun control forum , I think that the USA population is a lot more dense .
Yes , but they could have arisen incrementally .
If they have banned guns why are swords any different ? If you do n't see the need for one kind of weapon what is the point of admitting the other has a use ? Seems completely reasonable to me .
Natural selection should not be confused with the term evolution .
Even though our planet is getting warmer , it is still a lot cooler than it was 4000 years ago .
I guess the Creationists ' and Intelligent Design Creationists ' God isnt as good of a designer as one would expect for an all-knowing , all-powerful , loving God . We humans  the pinnacle of His creation  have hearts that just do n't seem to come out right a lot of the time . Youd think the Almighty God could do better than that . And this is looking at just heart development , never mind the numerous malformations associated with failure of the neuropore to close , ambiguous sexual phenotype ( you 'd think God would much opposed to this ! ) , and the many other types of problems newborns display , not to mention the millions of spontaneous abortions that occur every year : His designs do n't even make it full term . What an incompetent designer God is .
What I find hard to believe is that politicos will place their decision above the health of a woman ; only for political expediency
which did God create first , the laws or energy and matter ?
He really is afraid that this debate might happen .
I say new , beneficial traits arise across a given population at the same time because the traits arise from within each creature . Likewise genes may be transferred from one species to another horizontally , without selection .
However from the moment of conception organisms have some limited ability to reorganize their development if circumstances warrent , and that ability to change decreases with age .
Do you have anything other than choleric vituperation and bilious insults for people who express a view different to yours ?
This is fairly simple . You have two different worldviews here . In your view the moral code revolves around you being the standard and everyone should live up to that . In mine , the moral code is set outside of my control and I strive to abide by that . This is very evident in your post when you use the phrases `` I have '' and `` I would not '' . With me , it is n't because I , for some unknown reason , feel a certain way but because and outside moral code says I should live my life a certain way . You could just frame it as you believe you are `` god '' while I believe in a God . This is a little harder for people to swallow and I do n't mean for it to sound like an insult but it is an easy way to put it Both of these worldviews are fairly common and it relates to the abortion debate because one worldview almost has to lead to pro-life while the other could go either way .
Thats really funny to me . Women most assuredly are not treated equally by most of Mexico - Roman Catholic or not .
I am not saying that creation can be evidenced , simply that there is evidence against evolution which was never taught in my high school classes .
What do you mean there is no `` there is no evidence for a god '' ?
However , I am going to show that this is not evidence in any way , shape or form of common descent . Towards the end of this post , it will become perfectly clear exactly how these people are using a sleight-of-hand to deceive people .it will also become perfectly clear why primates and humans both have this defective gene .
Okay , heres the hypothesis I pulled out of my rear . Long ago , some females began to wear primordial shoes . The newly evolved shoe-wearing gene was selected for , as females with leather booties were less likely to cut their feet and acquire a deadly infection . This prolonged lifespan set up a selective pressure to develop a shoe fetish among males . Males who became attracted to the booties would be at an advantage , as they would more likely impregnate the bootie women who in turn would be more likely to survive to take care of their sperm products . Your hypothesis falls apart with your first statement . We all know that it would have been impossible for only `` some `` of them to have shoes . If one had them , then you can pretty much guess they all ... just had to have them . Now you make no inference to men having shoes . Here we can agree ... . Women probably did invent shoes
Evolution theory is not science at all , it is faith . Period . How can I conclude that ? Because an examination of the evidence shows that a bias/ ideology/ Godless belief system is the only real evidence for evolution theory :
Why do you find it necessary to fit observations to Genesis ? or why it makes perfect sense to design creatures that resemble humans but have them evolve from things that look like apes ? and so on ? Are you saying that mankind is the original goal of evolution ?
You 're just bald-faced lying , now . Since I have ( a ) made arguments based on facts , ( b ) used numerous sources , not just an online petition .
Not really . eugenics are not following evolution . Hitler for example did n't follow evolution at all . His entire aryan race did n't have a single fact of evolution in it .
What do you guys believe in , and why ? Back up your beliefs , por favor . I 'm gon na start off with something extremely general to **** some people off and get it started . Remember , this is just to get it started , i will explain myself agaisnt others later . I dont believe in God , or at least not in the way that seems correct to some people . Any objections ? [ Oh yea , and i am new to THESE boards , how do you create smilies and how to you do quotes at the bottom of your posts and how do you make quotes from other people ( Bold and italics ? ) ? ? ( Note : This is just a general question , not really part of the debate . Thanks ! ^_^ ) ]
However , I believe this is because most people going in to a scientific field are trying to figure out how life got here . Since they do not believe in God , they must cling to the belief with the most credibility .

Well here is an example of guns and lies . I am a law abiding citizen with a valide carry permit . I am going through a very bad divorce . My wife is on drugs and I 'm trying to get full custody of our daughter . Well she did n't like the idea too well so her and her father lied to the police and took a warrant out on me for aggravated assault . They said I put my hand on my gun and made a threat ( which I never did ) . They seized my gun and arrested me . Well several months later I 'm still awaiting trial on a hear say case with no evidence ! ! ! Its stories like this that makes me sick ! People being arrested for crimes they did n't commit and there rights being taken away over some petty high school BS ! Where are the laws to protect the innocent from people like them ?
This topic was discussed in another thread . Kelvin said that- `` If it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941 , you would be speaking Japanese if you live on the Westcoast , German if you live on the Eastcoast . '' Urban Legend . It should be illegal for women to have sex .
Experience is the only interaction we have with existence . If some aspect of existence exists ( ex . some hypothetical parallel universe ) that never manifests itself in human experience then we have no way of knowing its existence . We can guess but our guesses , not being based on experience , are completely arbitrary . Given that there are a nearly infinite number of imaginary scenarios that we can think up , the probability of the reality of any of those scenarious is miniscule .
I 'll trust anybody that 's not government funded , with a gun . Hell I 'd even trust drug dealers sooner than I 'd trust the government in terms of being armed . Governments all around the world have killed millions of their own people in genocides after disarming them , proving that government should never be armed .
Just curious , how legal is that ?
then what kind of logic makes you believe that it takes thousands/millions of years for populations of animals to `` adapt ? ''
I take an American view because it was once illegal here and I know how it was before it was legal .
That makes my point , thanks ! ( Of course you did n't have them as part of a gay couple , if that 's the point you were trying to make )
That is n't completely true . Bacteria have been observed to increase their mutation rate in times of stress . ( I do n't remember the exact source , but I do know that you provided it . ) Put another way , bacteria have been observed to introduce random changes in their DNA when they are presented with a problem . Also , while the ToE is not based on the assumption that DNA may change in response to environmental stimuli , it does n't rule that out , either .
Why do women opt for abortion over adoption ?
In your scenario , someone could come up with an arbitrary proclamation `` black people should be slaves to white people '' and build a morality based on that .
And it is much easier to have an abortion than to be a mother .

The Brady Center has released a report on President Obamas performance called President Obamas First Year : Failed Leadership , Lost Lives . The Presidents concessions to the guns anywhere mentality of the gun lobby and lack of leadership for common-sense gun laws has earned him a grade of F . President Obama signed legislation letting people carry concealed weapons in national parks and in checked luggage on Amtrak trains , adopted the gun lobbys empty rhetoric about just enforcing the laws on the books ,  and muzzled Cabinet members who expressed support for stronger gun laws . In addition , the White House voiced no objection to people carrying guns near Presidential events and his White House staff removed statements from the White House website that declared support for gun violence prevention laws . What a traitor !

Take for example Judge Learned Hand 's indictment of ALCOA . What 'crimes ' was ALCOA punished for ? To quote Hand : `` It was not inevitable that it should always anticipate increases in the demand for ingot and be prepared to supply them . Nothing compelled it to keep doubling and redoubling its capacity before others entered the field . It insists that it never excluded competitors ; but we can think of no more effective exclusion than progressively to embrace each new opportunity as it opened , and to face every new- comer with new capacity already geared into a great organization , having the advantage of experience , trade connections and the elite of personnel . '' [ Alan Greenspan , `` Antitrust '' published in Ayn Rand 's Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal ] In other words ALCOA was being punished for being too good a company , too competent in its management , in other words Alcoa 's crime is that it is too competitive .
So the start of personhood for a particular person is a variable , based on that individuals memory . Twenty years ago I could remember events at my fourth birthday , but today those memories are gone . For a while I had personhood at 4 years of age , but today , looking back , I did not have personhood until I was 6 . As I age and my memory fails , it may turn out that I did not have personhood until I was 21 years old . Personnhood comes and goes . Do I have it right ? Not aware ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Not aware of what ? Shoot a gun behind them and they will flinch . They are aware of loud noises . Throw them wildly into the air and they will cry . They are aware of their own movement . Pinch them , they will cry . They are self aware as they chew on their toes . And of course puppies are aware as well . Unless of course I do not understand what you mean by aware .
I 'm also not going to address my brother in every single post . He is a shining example of why I do n't like guns but that does n't mean I 'm going to talk about him constantly .
( CNN ) -- Drug traffickers are planting millions of marijuana plants on U.S. public lands ever closer to tourist sites , guarding their plots with heavy weaponry , federal authorities say . `` We destroy their plants and they come back , sometimes to the same spot , and replant , '' said U.S. Forest Service Special Agent Russ Arthur . `` It 's definitely possible that hikers and campers are going to find themselves in the middle of a field facing some very dangerous , armed bad guys , because this problem is everywhere , and it 's only getting worse . '' Across the nation , pot sites linked to cartels have been found in 15 states as far north as Washington , Arthur said . Last week , a portion of Sequoia National Park in the Sierra Nevada was closed to visitors while rangers dropped from helicopters into a marijuana farm a half-mile away from Crystal Cave , popular among tourists . Officials said there were five sites in the Yucca Creek Canyon where investigators recovered tons of trash , netting , chemicals and camping materials , a discovery that suggested the growers had been there , or planned to stay , for a long time . Though authorities destroyed the patch , whoever wanted to profit probably got what they wanted . Seventy-five percent of the plants had been harvested , said park spokeswoman Adrienne Freeman . `` Last week for six days , instead of having families and children walking down to Crystal Cave , we were flying helicopters to do a law enforcement operation , '' she said . `` That 's not fair . You should be able to come to the park and enjoy it . '' Freeman cautioned that there is a steep cliff near the site and most visitors would n't be skilled enough to trek into the area . But some might . In Idaho earlier this summer , hikers came upon 12,545 marijuana plants valued at $ 6.3 million , officials said . This week , the National Park Service was working to eradicate plants at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore , beloved by fishermen , where one year ago the agency brought out six dump trucks full of marijuana -- 10,000 plants -- valued at $ 8.5 million , according to chief ranger Mike Bremer . And on Friday , the Drug Enforcement Administration said it had found 14,500 marijuana plants growing in a patch of forest land 40 miles southwest of Denver , Colorado , where campers have ventured . The Forest Service has stepped up its efforts to raid forest areas in Georgia and Tennessee , including areas near the Chattahoochee River , a favorite among hikers , campers and adventure racers . The agency has started podcasting and posting signs on public land , trying to describe to regular folks what a pot field looks like and how to get away from it quickly . Though traffickers have been planting on public lands for years , figures from the U.S. Forest Service indicate the sheer volume of marijuana plants on public land has increased every year since 2005 -- by millions . And those are just the plants that the government knows about and has destroyed . Most pot farms are cultivated by low-level cartel workers , many who are working to pay off smugglers who helped them cross the border , officials have said . Campsites are sophisticated and well hidden , with foxholes and sniper nests , Arthur told CNN . The workers plant four to five farms at a time to get one bountiful crop , reckoning that two might be destroyed by law enforcement , one might fail because of weather , and another could be pilfered by what officers call `` pot pirates , '' Americans who risk getting close to traffickers to score free pot , Arthur said . Dean Growdon , an assistant sheriff and commander of the Lassen County , California , Narcotics Task Force , said he 's especially concerned about pot farm violence now because hunting season is about to start . `` We get more reports this time of year from hunters who 've stumbled onto sites , '' he said . `` We had a guy who discovered they were growing on the back portion of his property . '' The sheriff 's department knows firsthand of the dangers . Two deputies are still recovering from being shot in June when they stumbled on a pot field , Sheriff Steven Warren said . In the encounter , one of the deputies shot and killed a grower , Warren said , and the surviving growers are being prosecuted , he said . `` Our guys saw the field and were trying to make their way back to get help when they ran into the growers . There were two [ suspected growers ] laying back on a rock and when our guys saw them , there was a moment when everyone just froze , '' said Warren . `` There was a guy in a tent that had an AK-47 and our guys have a gun on him . `` To me , that grower , he was on a suicide mission . He could have never believed he would live through that , '' the sheriff said . Although federal agents have stepped up raids on sites across the country , arrests are tough to make because growers know the terrain like the backs of their hands . When authorities surprise them by dropping into their camps , growers dart off to hiding places or through the thick woods , making foot chases difficult . In July , a multi-agency sting in California 's Fresno County -- the largest ever nationwide -- netted 420,000 plants , worth $ 1.6 billion , and the arrests of 100 people . As many as 82 Mexican nationals were taken into custody and deported , the Fresno County state attorney 's office told CNN . So far , the U.S. attorney 's office has charged 16 people . If convicted , those without prior drug charges would face 10 years to life and a $ 4 million fine ; those with drug records could get double that sentence . But little intelligence is gleaned from growers . They do n't want to talk , fearful of the consequences their families could face back in Mexico . It 's still mostly a mystery how growers keep their camps going , how they transport their food , and where and how they move their finished product . It 's also mostly unclear how they are managing to carry so much equipment -- piping , chemicals and basic living necessities -- into the deep woods . But it 's clear they are causing expensive and irreversible damage to the ecosystem . Growers often dam up natural waterways with PVC pipe to redirect water to their plants , or poison the land and animals with insecticides . Many poach for food . Tons of trash is found scattered on the sites . In Sequoia National Park , $ 1 million has been spent since 2006 on marijuana plantation cleanup alone , and the damage done to Crystal Cave will be felt for years to come , said the park spokeswoman , Adrienne Freeman . `` We are continually discovering new species in that cave , and we are letting Mexican cartels threaten to wipe that out , '' she said .
How strange that this thread that aims at the heart of the basis of creationism and IDiotism has gone unanswered . Could it be that creationists and XXXXXX recognize the weakness of their position and have no answer ?
... to curtail abortions . Any woman who has an abortion for convenience only ( not raped , no incest , no danger to the mother 's life ) shall have both ovaries removed . What do y'all think ?
Right now in this house I am sweating . This is how the my body reacts to the 90 degree teperature out side . If I were to spend more time in hotter climates I would adapt in such a way that 90 degrees does n't cause me to sweat . This is adaptaion not mutation .
10 . Extreme Complexity Complexity beyond comprehension characterizes all life forms , including the so-called simple cell. As Dr. Micheal Denton states referring to the cell ,  ... we would find ourselves in a world of supreme technology and bewildering complexity ... beyond our own creative capacities. Everything , from atomic structures to cells , organs , organ systems , and living creatures speaks of incredible order , balance , and unity as a whole .

Here is what fascinates me about the judgmental criticism you offer of my opinion .
As for Germany , gun ownership was legalized five years before Hitler came to power , which does n't exactly support the argument that gun ownership is a defense against tyranny .
A few Bible studies , comparing it to the flow of events , the nature of people , my shortcomings , the shortcomings of science etc , convinced me .
Partly because it is entirely dependent on one particular human being for its survival , after birth the baby can be looked after by pretty much anyone , before it is entirely reliant on one person , if that person dies , the feotus dies .
Because it will encourage teens to engage in riskier behavior . Abstinence until marriage is still the best way .
Nobody that supports gun ownership would mention it having any relation to military service .
For those who are in Christ the tendancy is to be pulled towards good decisions .
did you miss the part where it is ... the attempt to abort . which kills the women . it is not child birth that kills those women . it is an attempt to abort . if they didnt try and kill their baby.. they would not of died . Having a child , is not a trajedy ... its just part of life . its not a wrongful burden ... or a flaw of existance.. its nature . dah ... do you even read what is being posted ? -Mosheh Thezion
The figures for the number of gun related deaths in the US should be evidence enough that 'the people ' can not be trusted with guns . This does not mean all the people , but a large enough proportion of the people to be a danger the rest of you .
Feminist Science ( http : //www.cddc.vt.edu/feminism/sci.html )
California may have to cut prison population by 40 percent So how can THIS end up good ? How do we fix this ? What ? More gun control ?
It 's called Earth , you might have visited once . Regardless of how it got here , evolution occurs and can be observed on a daily basis .
I have laid down some conditions before I give up my guns . They are not going to happen . There is no way I see within my life , that the 2nd Amendment will be repealled . There is no way that the National Guard will become `` militia-ized '' in my life time .
First of all , when gun owners say ban guns , it means , if you want to ban ANY Gun , you are a gun banner ! You guys want to muck up the argument with we do n't want to ban all guns , just some guns !
Life at every level -- from humans down to bacteria -- exhibit intelligence and very often cooperation . Darwinists got it all wrong .
How will we use it to feed the hungry ?
It 's just the same flip flopping over and over . Depending on the argument , `` science does n't exclude the divine '' , { then switcharoo } , `` science proves there is no divine . '' Just depends on the setting of the argument . ( you do have your copy of Victor Stenger 's book ; God - The failed Hypothesis / how science shows that God does not exist , do n't you ?
Gay sex sin is a perversion and an abomination according to the Bible .
Hello , please read http : //www.reasons.org/resources/apo ... ing.shtml ? main It is a good christian site that explains that there are lots of problems with Dr Russell Humphreys ' hypothesis .
What consequences would there be for a mother who did n't want to give the name of the father ? Would there be any ?
No , it is you young padawan learner ... that has been mislead , some of the most famous and noted Darwinian Naturalists such as Crick , Huxley , Lipson ... and others have admitted to their own discredit that the entire theory of evolutions rests on chance , here ... but here , lets burst that bubble for you a bit more :
The story of the literal Genesis is only rejected by those who are not looking to the absolute Truth found in God Almighty .
1 . Are you referring to `` Christian '' creationism ? Intelligent Design ? If so , then it 's nothing more than a Christio-centric argument . There 's no difference between Christian Creationism/ ID and the Wapuri warrior ideal creation myth which focuses on the divine Parrot . If you are focusing on Christian creationism vs Evolution , there is more than one system of creation , and it does n't necessarily revolve around one omnipotent , omniscient being . It could be an accident as well ! What one thing is an obvious fact from History ? You are talking about western civilization . Western Civilization 's religious beliefs are n't the be-all , end all , of creation ... there 's as reason to believe in spontaneous generation as there is in Christian Creationism . You can also use any eastern or south american or native american belief system of creation .
If what you uninformed religious bigots and hatemongers believe was n't so pathetic , it would be funny . What 's a guy aspoda do !
Monster : I believe in something very much like intelligent design but I also believe in evolution . I believe in a creator but summarily reject the bible . Clearly the bible is myth and a dangerous one at that . But I do not see why one can not and should not believe that evolution is simply the way our intelligent designer created us . An intelligent designer would design a system to produce the product as easily as possible . After the singularity was designed there is simply nothing left to do but sit back and enjoy the show .
Browsing through AiG today I came across Ken Ham 's 'Creation : where 's the proof ? ' page . I found it very interesting and well written , and decided to put my own understanding to the test by discussing various points here .
If God is wrong , then the Bible is wrong . Evolution contradicts the Bible , plain and simple .
Not beyond the pale and not impacting on TOE .
I care where that speck came from . Where did it come from ? It had to come from somewhere .
What largely prompted this thread happened last Tuesday - 6:30 AM , and a six-figure weather forecaster scientist guy assured everyone watching him that a pretty nice day was ahead , largely cloudy yet with peeks of sun , with a slim chance of very spotty rain . 2 hours later , the beginning of widespread heavy rain , for three solid hours . Unusual of course , but if we have scientific blunders concerning a few miles , I can imagine we could have a few blunders concerning hundreds of thousands of light years .
When we drive our cars , the fuel emits into the air , causing global warming .
The SGC ( Standard Genetic Code ) has an EM ( Error Minimization ) value ( see Methods for calculation ) of 60.7 . Ten thousand random codes have an average EM value of 74.5 , and only 0.03 % of these have equal or greater optimality than the SGC . These calculations once again illustrate the remarkable optimization of the genetic code for EM .
Keep in mind two important points : 1 . Reason does not imply truth , it 's a method of seperating truth from what is false , and you can quite easily ( and do every day ) , reason something to a false conclusion . 2 . You can believe whatever you like , and it can certainly impact your life ( faith ) , however it can not be said that faith is based on rational belief , or takes part in reason , in any way , it is the opposite of reason .
Look to this site , which does not credit Keynes with the above , for other statements by Keynes : John Maynard Keynes - Wikiquote
Another lie . The sentence you 've quoted never made any such argument .
Creationist make little quips about how evolution must be a racist theory et cetera but when I ask them to explain in more detail they just disappear . I find this quite annoying what should I do about it ?
You surely are not insulting nocturnal09 by calling her an easy target are you ?
Just thought that i would ask any pro choice people to please explain what it actualy is that termination stops ?
First of all , the government can not increase the volume and social acceptance of a drug - only the market and society can do that . Government can not even decrease the volume or social acceptance of drugs - despite the government 's efforts , drug use has remained relatively constant . What has n't remained constant is violent crime , which has gone up during the drug war as it did during alcohol prohibition .
They need to keep their opinions to themselves and out of the law the effect gay peoples lives . I see nothing wrong with locking up those who incite hatred towards gay people just as we lock up people who shout fire in a crowded theatre .
4 ) If the militia is the National Guard , then I want formal seperation of National Guard from Federal authority .
How many babies have you supported killing ?
Actually what they are really doing is ignoring silly irrelevent questions from clueless people with a religious agenda to promote .
I am interested in your comment that natural selection is consistent with creationism . It was Darwin who first proposed that natural selection can be the major force driving the evolution of species . I thought that it was a creationist who first talked about natural selection and saw it as a way of slowing down the effects of the Curse that God placed on His whole creation ( i.e . by getting rid of mutations - beneficial mutations however are n't as readily removed from a population as they help a creature survive in a particular environment ) , after Adam and Eve sinned and rebelled against God .
~snip~ FLYNT : No . I see no concern there , because they asked George W. Bush the question about his use of cocaine without any evidence at all , and he sidestepped the issue . Of course , he admitted he 's been a drunk for twenty years and so that coupled with the additional information that we have , you know , would just be devastating to him . WARD : Well , Let 's talk about the information that you have . FLYNT : Well , we 've been doing an investigation for a little over eight months to the effect that an abortion took place in 1970 in Houston , Texas . He was working for his father 's campaign when he was running for the senate against Lloyd Bentsen , and a fellow by the name of Robert Chandler was the campaign manager . He got a girl pregnant during this period of time , and she had an abortion . We 've been able to locate the doctor who performed the procedure ( unintelligible ) hospital in Houston . Not only that but we have the affidavits from four of her friends stating that they knew about the affair , the pregnancy and the subsequent abortion . The only thing we could not have which we needed to break the story was the girl to come out , and she would not come out . Whether she was afraid or whether she was paid off , I do n't really want to speculate , because I do n't know what the actual reason was . But when I started taking this to the mainstream media , I said you do n't have to break the story , just ask the question , you know . You asked the cocaine question , so just ask if he 's ever facilitated an abortion or paid for an abortion or if he was the father of a child . Just give him the chance to admit or deny it . No one would touch it . WARD : As of now , the woman who you know denies that she had the abortion ? FLYNT : No , no , no . She does n't deny that . We know she had the abortion . We know she was Bush 's girlfriend at the time . This was in the 1970 's , he would have been in his twenties at the time . But she does not want to come out . The last conversation my investigators had with her , she said I do n't have anything bad to say about George W. And they said , well , how about when he did not come to visit you in the hospital when you had the abortion , did n't that upset you ? So she got very upset and irate because I took that line of questioning , and said , you know , I am not going to talk to you anymore about this issue . WARD : But when your investigators talked to this woman , did she ever say to them that you guys are wrong , I never had the abortion . FLYNT : No . No . WARD : And in these affidavits , I assume you have copies of the affidavits , you have affidavits from four of her friends saying that they know she had the abortion ? FLYNT : Yes , and we have this guy , Robert Chandler , who I said was George Bush 's campaign manager at the time , his girlfriend is one of our key sources on this story who actually accompanied the girl who had the abortion to the hospital . WARD : Were abortions legal in Texas at this time ? FLYNT : No , that was before Roe versus Wade and that makes it a crime . And that 's the reason why I felt the story was important , because I felt the media should ask him : Is abortion okay for you and your family but not the rest of America ? I felt the issue of it being a crime should be brought up as well . ~snip~
Scientists have also been able to induce another species of bacteria , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , to evolve the capability to break down the same nylon byproducts in a laboratory by forcing them to live in an environment with no other source of nutrients . The P. aeruginosa strain did not seem to use the same enzymes that had been utilized by the original Flavobacterium strain . Other scientists were able to get the ability to generate the enzymes to transfer from the Flavobacterium strain to a strain of E. coli bacteria via a plasmid transfer .
Ocean acidity is old news ...
Reptile develops feathers . They offer reduced protection .
Let me explain , evolution ( the big picture ) involves a certain kind of animal turning into a different kind of animal , e.g . a reptile turning into a mammal for example .
Makes about as much sense as saying many of the car hating crowd ( people who support such laws as car registration ) also own cars . More evidence that your handlers have trained you to see the world in black and white .
He was probably an XXXXX to begin with then .
At conception a particular individual 's DNA is established . This is a scientific fact . So from conception one certain individual is forming and most likely will be born if the pregnancy is allowed to proceed ( the majority of pregnancies allowed to proceed result in a live , healthy baby ) . Now , if the mother chooses to abort that person will not be born . You or I would not be here if we had been aborted . And why not ? Because that person 's life was ended while still in the womb . Consider that person whose life was ended by abortion . How is abortion not killing ? Why does it not matter to you that a life is ended by abortion ? Even if it was just a clump of cells ( I can hear this one coming ) in the beginning , the fact is , in the end it will most likely be a live human being and that is n't changed by it 's alleged `` clump of cells in the beginning '' status . Please explain .
Monkeys do n't generally have problems with their private parts being functional .
Now , I have no problem with the concept of epigenetic inheritance . But even if it were true it would n't do away with natural selection . Just as with basic genetic mutation , which is n't going to go away , one would expect some individuals to exhibit epigenetic alterations and others not to .
What Would We Expect to Find if the World Had Flooded
You did n't qualify it by saying `` some '' pregnancies are life threatening or unbearable . Maybe yours was , but how can you say that for every woman in the world ?
So you 're saying that the ones who 're eligible to carry a gun , those who 're 21 or older , never been convicted of a crime , undergo fingerprinting , pay hundreds of dollars , attend an eight hour course held by the police , pass a firearms safety class , and weight three months to finally get their permit , would intentionally use it as an excuse to murder a teacher over a trivial matter like an unfavorable grade ?
oh yeah sorry if my definition sucks . i was in a hurry .
Great , and typically dishonest of you to post about the opinion of an Episcopal church which is pro gay and one of the most liberal in Souther California : All Saints Episcopal Church is an Episcopal church in Pasadena , California . It is widely claimed to be one of Southern California 's largest and most liberal churches , and is the largest Episcopal parish west of the Mississippi . It belongs to the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles . All Saints is known to support gays and lesbians , opposes the death penalty , opposes the Iraq war , and supports anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan .
Thanks ! There 's a petrified forest in Mississippi also . I do n't know how long it took to produce the petrification and expose the pieces , but I 'll find out next trip . I 'm curious how the YECs could use this in an argument since the process described could hardly occur in nature . Are they going to argue that all the petrified woods could have been formed within the 6000 year life of the earth ? Likely , the use of argon was simply to preclude the presence of oxygen . Other inert gases could have done the same .
None of the displays in London are based on mythology .
As to the tired , misleading references to Catholic beliefs we 're seeing here , you 'll note that no `` theistic evolutionist '' ( Christian ) has finished any discussion with me in this forum .
Darned Swiss gun laws !
More people actuallysupport the FSM school of creationsim - would you agree that this could be a suitable compromise ?
That 's what `` reaching across the aisle '' is all about ! Although there was one Republican from Louisiana who agreed to the bill because Medicaid expansion alone would cover half her state . Otherwise , this `` appeasement '' stuff , as Keith Olbermann noted , is b.s . : You 're babbling .
And neither can millions of other heterosexuals , something you ignore . As for nature , technically anything that occurs ever without supernatural causes is in fact in nature . We are a part of nature . Everything we do is a part of nature . Therefore , by taking the genetic data of two gays , placing it in a egg and having a surrogate mother bring it to term , gays can reproduce themselves .
No matter what religion we are , we are human , we stray , we sin , WE ARE NOT PERFECT . But many religions preach forgiveness for sins . God forgives .
17 . THE BIBLE Lastly , and most importantly , the Bible says that God created the universe and every living thing , so the world must have been created . In denying this we call God a liar . And so you can see how evolution theory undermines the omniscience and even the existence of God . And if there is no God , why not do our own thing ? Or if God is not all-knowing , indeed , a liar , why put our trust in Him ? Evolution theory logically leads to these humanistic ideas . Christians must take a stand for the Word of God , or be accountable on that judgment day for the souls of those whom we did not warn .
Perhaps this throws light on the question of whether T.rex was warm-bloodied or cold-bloodied . The possibility ( if confirmed ) of a feathered T.rex seems to indicate that they were warm-bloodied creatures that required insulation in a cool climate ? ? ?
I find it interesting that the slippery slope fallacy keeps popping up again and again in the arguments of pro-gun activists even after the Heller decision .
I 'm of the opinion marc9000 's original resolution is unworkable ; it would place a judge in an extremely difficult position in which to formulate a decision .
I 'll try to be nice since you wrote it in 7th grade . Homo Sapien has n't existed for millions of years . It would be more appropriate to say that the Earth has provided the basis for life for hundreds of millions of years . And most of that goes into landfills ... . Not really . World forests are at risk for farm land and non-paper logging , not for paper which is being replaced by post consumer waste at increasing rates . Most paper people use today contains at least some recycled paper . It 's not just cars and catalytic converters have greatly decreased emissions . Cereal factories are n't that big of polluters . The largest polluters are energy plants with a few exceptions like some of Alcoa 's smelters which burns one of the dirtiest types of coal in the almunimum production process . And the world will go from bad to worse , from worse to horrible and from horrible to castastrphoic . Not suddenly . That 's day after tomorrow fantasy . Flooding is more a immediate problem . No they are n't . The sun is the main source of weather through the energy transfer from light to various parts of the enviroment . We do n't actually know this for sure . There is some data but much speculation as to what is exactly causing larger and more frequent storms . The bigger problem of reducing salinity is the currents themselves and how they intergrate with migration and heat transfer . Sources of food that humans depend upon could disappear if currents drastically change . And the basis of Day after Tommorrow is correct in how the gulf stream helps regulate temperatures in Europe .
If Obama and Biden are elected , and with the majority of congress already consisting of anti-gun democrats , and if anti-gun judiciaries are appointed to the supreme court , then gun ownership could very well be banned , unconstitutional or not . But , since Obama can only serve eight years max , then the next president could undo the gun ban . But if Obama does ban guns , he will surely make the ban unchangeable by future leaders . I personally cant see Obama , congress , or the supreme court passing a gun ban though , because it would not only be political suicide , a gun ban would also devastate the economy . But if a gun ban is tried , look for the right to vote to dissapear as well , plus he will do away with the eight years maximum law that he can serve , he will do these to prevent being voted out of office and to keep from running out of time in which he can serve as president , thus making Obama a dictator at this point , and from there , all hell would break loose for Americans .
On what grounds do you seek to redefine the institution of marriage from it 's accepted standard in this country ?
After all , unfertilized eggs and sperm also have the *potential* to become full people but no one is concerned about their loss . For many of us it is the actual mentally-existing person that is most important .

I did n't realize evolutionist were so closed-minded when I entered this forum .
Look at S Africa , where illegal posession of a firearm can net you the death penalty . Besides the highest murder rate in the western world , and the fact that they drive around with flamethrowers on their cars because carjackings and violent thefts are so common , it is virtually a pacifist utopia .
Was incest okay back then ?
So all of you people who are opposed to imposing your moral belief on someone answer this for me ... What would have happened if Abraham Lincoln wouldnt have pushed his moral belief that slavery was wrong and that he wanted to get rid of it ? In a similar and more important issue , we are debating abortion.. Is it moral that 48 million babies ' blood is on all of our hands and some of us dont even feel a conviction about it ? ? Personally , i think its neccessary for the agenda of ending abortion to be pushed just like Abe Lincoln pushed his agenda to end slavery..
So doing a detailed study of something requires that one takes a class for it in a university and reads books papers written on it by `` real scientists '' ? Wow , I never knew that . Thanx for enlightening me .
As a complete outsider i.e not from the US , I find it strange that people actually believe in things like Youth Earth Creationism . I honestly think the US needs to go through another 'enlightenment ' to get rid of silly notions like Intelligent Design and YEC , to replace Superstition and fear with Science . How wide spread is this movement to get Youth Earth Creationism taught as Science ?
Right . And it 's much easier to argue the root cause , as you pushed for on this forum as well , since you have to deal with fewer arguments . There 's no reason to argue about `` can god lift an unliftable rock '' , if you start at the begining ... define god . -Mach
I am from Kansas and resent ( pandion ) being called stupid simply for living here . That being said , the people who voted for these school board folks do deserve to be called stupid . Well they would if they had much of a choice . I ca n't say this for sure , but knowing Kansas politics , I would say that , chances are , there was only one person on the ticket and if there were more , they probably all held the same views on evolution . That 's most of Kansas for ya . As a Missourian once said about Kansans : You 'd vote for a cupcake if it registered republican . There is an exception to this rule though . After the first evolution debacle back in '99 , Kansans voted those dimwits out and put in a new board that changed what the previous board had done . It just seems that some people have a very short memory . Why must these XXXXXX stain Kansas again ?
I believe abortion is a crime against humanity and should be outlawed .
A man who remains stiff-necked after many rebukes will suddenly be destroyed -- without remedy . - Proverbs 29:1

BTW - I do n't think hell is a place , either . For the lack of a better word , I believe it is a direction that eventually leads to spiritual death .
Evolutionism on the other hand uses all of our current technology in microbiology to sort out 'real dna ' from 'junk dna ' .
... and woe betide you if you dare to express any doubts .
What are you talking about ? I 've been down this road before . I do n't think that gun control is the most important issue in the world but I do intend to own one as soon as I move out of NY in hopefully a year or 2 . I totally agree that people should be free to own guns , as they are . I also have no problems with states making it mandatory for gun owners to have permits , which some states do . I 'm not an extremist . I plan to teach my kids how to properly use guns , much to my wife 's protest . And I 'll probably own more than one , at least one in my bedroom and one in my car . What I do n't get is the what seems to me like an overwhelming fear of `` what if '' from both sides . The pro-gun camp fears that any gun regulation policies , something as simple as a county registration , will inevitably lead to policies that ban all guns . And the anti-gun crowd fears that if people can own guns at all , then gun-toting bandits will jump out of every alley and start popping people randomly . So its a case of total gun freedom vs total `` gunlessness '' . I 'm not convinced that either of these `` what-if '' scenarios will occur . After all , as it is presently , gun crimes still occur , people have their rights to own guns revoked on a case by case basis , and dying of gun shots is actually very rare . I believe a balance can be found . And as for supporting the constitution , this issue is actually about supporting an ammendment to the constitution . If the constitution was so holy and inerrant , why did it need to be ammendments ? I 'm not the one that was so dissatisfied with the document that I had to ammend it anyway . And the insinuations and inuendos you say I made ( not actually saying what they were ) , the rest of your pro-gun team confirmed my observations , just as you did now . Thanks .
Do you think the God will be happy with abortion ?
No need to change the verbage : `` ... individuals with variations that are fortuitously best suited to changing local environments . '' Like folks who migrated to northern latitudes and happened to have lighter skin ( variation ) were healthier and therefore produced more and healthier offspring . Over generations the lighter skinned came to dominate the group while becomming lighter still . Why is that so difficult ? No one is saying the darker skinned folks never reproduced . They just were n't as successful in the long run .
Why then wo n't you state your ultimate agenda ... `` reasonable gun control '' is not an agenda if you can not back that statment up . A view that inteferes wih my constitutional right is an attempt by the lunatic fringe to intefere with my life ... Simple .
As we learn more about the functions of the genetic code , it becomes ever clearer that the degeneracy in the genetic code is not exploited in such a way as to optimize one function , but rather to optimize a combination of several different functions simultaneously . Looking deeper into the structure of the code , we wonder what other remarkable properties it may bear . While our understanding of the genetic code has increased substantially over the last decades , it seems that exciting discoveries are waiting to be made .
Government is violence .
Like , how many shooting in Germany ? Like , what 's the ratio of shootings to population in the two nations of Germany and the U.S ?
So , if not from the U.S. , where do they come from ? There are a variety of sources : -- The Black Market . Mexico is a virtual arms bazaar , with fragmentation grenades from South Korea , AK-47s from China , and shoulder-fired rocket launchers from Spain , Israel and former Soviet bloc manufacturers . -- Russian crime organizations . Interpol says Russian Mafia groups such as Poldolskaya and Moscow-based Solntsevskaya are actively trafficking drugs and arms in Mexico . - South America . During the late 1990s , the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) established a clandestine arms smuggling and drug trafficking partnership with the Tijuana cartel , according to the Federal Research Division report from the Library of Congress . -- Asia . According to a 2006 Amnesty International Report , China has provided arms to countries in Asia , Africa and Latin America . Chinese assault weapons and Korean explosives have been recovered in Mexico . -- The Mexican Army . More than 150,000 soldiers deserted in the last six years , according to Mexican Congressman Robert Badillo . Many took their weapons with them , including the standard issue M-16 assault rifle made in Belgium . -- Guatemala . U.S. intelligence agencies say traffickers move immigrants , stolen cars , guns and drugs , including most of America 's cocaine , along the porous Mexican-Guatemalan border . On March 27 , La Hora , a Guatemalan newspaper , reported that police seized 500 grenades and a load of AK-47s on the border . Police say the cache was transported by a Mexican drug cartel operating out of Ixcan , a border town .
Your attitude is wrong . Instead of using your mind and energies to disprove the bible you should use all your power to to learn how to obey the teachings of the Son of God and mature emotionally and in wisdom .

Anway et al. , `` Epigenetic transgenerational actions of endocrine disruptors and male fertility , '' Science , 308:1466-9 , 2005 . ( Cited in 112 papers ) The finding : A group led by Michael Skinner from Washington State University briefly exposed pregnant female rats to endocrine disruptors and found sperm defects in the F1 generation of male rats , which were passed through the male germ line to the F4 generation . Offspring of treated rats also had DNA methylation differences . `` Potentially this transgenerational epigenetic mechanism could be how the environment is influencing disease , '' says Skinner . The significance : The study provided clear evidence of multigenerational effects of environmental exposure , says Andrea Gore , from University of Texas , Austin , who has since collaborated with Skinner 's group . The catch : Doses used in the study were higher than those seen in the environment , the authors note . `` All bets are off when you extrapolate the findings '' to humans or other animals , says Randy Jirtle from Duke University . Skinner 's group is now working to study the effects of dose on sperm viability . The progress : Skinner and colleagues allowed male offspring of treated rats to age six months to a year and found that a number of other conditions , such as kidney disease and breast tumors , were passed across generations ( Endocrinol , 147 : 5515-23 , 2006 ) . Jirtle says it will be important to identify the precise methylation effects that give rise to the phenotypes , `` because epigenomes vary greatly [ among ] species .

Wrong . It is a precision machine designed to kill effectively . It can be operated by other than human means . Yes , you would be wrong . No , they do n't . True , but nobody suggested there was such a grey area . We accept your word . I have never seen this , do you have examples ? So far as I am aware , nobody but you believes this to be the case .
Here is what I define evolution as : Evolution is a three part theory ,
My point in starting the thread is not merely that Christians fall short of their aspirations . No ... .this is worse . Because this particular U.S . Senator , an avowed conservative Christian , has actively worked to restrict the rights of others to marry , supposedly in the name of `` protecting '' or `` defending '' marriage , while at the same time undermining his own marriage . He makes a pretense , for political gain I suspect , of `` defending marriage '' by playing to people 's anti-gay prejudices while himself undermining marriage in his real life . That 's hypocrisy , and it 's dishonesty .
Duck , you are entitled to your views -- and so is the Pope . However , you have absolutely no right at all to impose your version of reality upon me and other women .
Really ? Oh , derrrr ! Obviously , some people no longer use a sense of humour ; a relic .
Women are human beings with rights and should be treated as such , rather than as breeding machines .
Whether you want to believe it or not is irrelevant . Our schools have the obligation to teach the most current scientific theories , you know , stuff like the earth orbits the sun . The students have an obligation to learn and understand their understanding of those theories .
... where are the MILLIONS of links that supposedly connected them ?
`` When you go to war against your enemies ... suppose you see a beautiful woman whom you desire ... you shall take her..and she shall marry you . '' - Deut . 21:10
Just because you do n't have a handle on what civil rights are does n't make the phrase arbitrary . It 's a legal term , not a catch phrase . I 'm not a lawyer , I could n't track down the exact definition they use in Massachusetts , but rest assured they have one .
Evolution is able to be disproven in so many ways ... .here 's a simple , lethal disproof : Ever since Darwin came along , evolutionists have claimed that the human race is evolving . We supposedly evolved from simplistic monkeys to what we are today . They think we all built up from one-celled organisms to the physiological works of art that we are today . But I suggest just the opposite is actually happening .

Quote : Guns were used in 4,120 robberies last year - a 10 % jump - including a 9 % rise to 1,439 in the number of street robberies where guns were used . There was also a rapid and unexplained increase in the number of times householders were confronted in their own homes by armed criminals . Residential firearms robberies show a 46 % leap , a record 645 cases in England and Wales - up 204 on the previous year and four times the level recorded in 2000-01. sorce http : //www.breitbart.com/news/na/paF ... ubstitute.html
Thus if plasticity can instantly effect the hatch time of eggs , the size , shape , color , and physical/behavior characteristics of an animal , then about the only place I see a role for random mutations via natural selection is in the wishfully creative minds of evolutionists .
Creationism starts with a conclusion , and finds data to support it . According to the scientific method , one is suppose to look at data , and draw a conclusion from it . Therefore , creationism is not science , and needs not take any scientific consideration . The end .
Someone who actually had knowledge about the Civil War would certainly know that Lincoln did not believe the Union could be preserved unless slavery was abolished .
I assure you I never made such a claim .
I like how the Chinese view Christians . They simply can not figure out why so many missionaries go over to China and try to convert people . The Chinese are so lenient about religion that many practice several different religions and do n't have such strict codes as Christianity .
NO I think that if certain religious groups can fire people for being gay then I as a gay man should be allowed to fire those of that certain religion .

For the sake of discussion let 's say it is the same one all the signers of the Declaration of Independence agreed it was .
Now all evangelical christians will now be linked with the KKK . So when the average person thinks of christianity they will be seeing the KKK .
How do we rationally explain these creatures existence so recently in our human history if they were extinct for millions of years ? And if they were the imaginings of bronze age sheep herders as your atheists/evolutionists would have you believe , then how did these ignorant people describe creatures we can now recognize from fossil evidence ? And while your at it , ask yourself if it 's reasonable that the bones of dead creatures have survived from 60 million years to some estimated to be more than 200 million years without becoming dust ?
Repeal of all legislative provisions that restrict the sex or number of persons entering into a marriage unit ; and the extension of legal benefits to all persons who cohabit regardless of sex or numbers
Well , of course the issue is n't `` limiting '' marriage , but rather making it more open-ended . But again , either way , it 'll be a moot point before too long .
The question one has to ask is it more dangerous for the girl to carry the baby to term or to abort it ?
The federal level is perhaps a different story . However , the Constitutional amendment process allows for the masses to have their way in every area . Not through direct voting , but through their representatives .
No , it 's just the one big voice .
`` Brady II '' redefines `` firearm '' to include magazines and `` any part of the action '' ( such as pins , springs , or screws ) . Thus , if a person has two Colt pistols , three Remington rifles , and four magazines ( of any size ) for each gun , then he own an `` arsenal . '' Or if he owned two guns , six magazines , and a box of disassembled gun parts that contained five springs , five pins , and five screws , then he would own 23 `` firearms '' and would have to obtain an `` arsenal '' license .
Then again , if you 've pigeonholed God into a constrictive box based on your own understanding , but you insist that God exists , perhaps you should rethink why you felt the need to cram your God into a tiny box . Science can only disprove a God to whom some human attributes a limitation .
Sorry about that . I meant Athiests . And by modern , I mean present-day .

Outside of the fallacy above you fail to explain how gay relationships are harmful .

Great , and typically dishonest of you to post about the opinion of an Episcopal church which is pro gay and one of the most liberal in Souther California : All Saints Episcopal Church is an Episcopal church in Pasadena , California . It is widely claimed to be one of Southern California 's largest and most liberal churches , and is the largest Episcopal parish west of the Mississippi . It belongs to the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles . All Saints is known to support gays and lesbians , opposes the death penalty , opposes the Iraq war , and supports anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan . Can you find a bible believing church that agrees with them ? All Saints Episcopal Church ( Pasadena , California ) - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia
I think a lot of people are uncomfortable dealing with this issue so they choose to focus a lot on personal self defense against criminals instead of what the Second Amendment is mainly or solely about .
There doesnt have to be a defined `` shot calling '' leadership of it any more than there has to be one in Judeo Christianity . The two are actually comparable - Christianity gets its leadership/organization through Biblical reference and church leadership . Evolution gets its leadership/organization through the philosophical writings of everyone from Herbert Spencer to Richard Dawkins .
Great post , Archangel !
Here 's the basic AP story :
A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children 's children ... - Proverbs 13:22 Sell that ye have and give alms ... - Luke 12:33

There is no way to judge on a case-by-case basis .
Why does this matter ? Is this your own personal view of what a person is ? 

We have certainly had our run ins . I had thought I had apologized on the last one . I do not recall having a problem with you since the last run in on my review of one of the orignal papers that was terribly misunderstood by lay people as well as the scientific community . I can not even remember it at this time . You seemed to understand my misunderstanding . Let me take the time to formally apologize for any rudeness to you in the past . I do have a hot head at times . I think we both have impatience for folks who do not understand some concepts .
I do n't think it 's invasive at the 2nd grade level , in the school . At least it should n't be -- rather than teachers teaching about relationships , I think they should teach about the subjects that schools are there for . You know , Writing , math , elementary science , geography , etc .

Why did my post get deleted ? Did you guys realize I was right so you decided to delete it when we exposed the religion of evolution ? Anyway , supersport , good job , keep up the good work . I liked that last link you posted it was really interesting , but someone deleted it - they must have realized the truth it exposed . I think it 's funny how the evolution beleivers can call you a liar and all sorts of other stuff , but when we point out how unfair it is , the evolution mod goes and deletes our posts . Total bias . The mod should at least send you a message to tell you why the post was deleted , if it happens again without warning I 'm going to contact the admin about the bias : I 've kept a record of my posts here because this has happened before on other boards with large evolution support .
Actually all decisions based on the self ARE selfish decisions . I really do n't care . I make them all the time too . Everyone does . While this is a philosophical issue I really see it as odd that people claim not to be selfish when doing something that benefits them or prevents harm to them with little regard to anyone else .
DALLAS ( AP ) - A shootout outside a north Dallas bank has left at least two people wounded and customers and employees locked in the bank 's vault . The shooting happened just before 11 a.m. outside the United Texas Bank . The bank is located on the first floor of the Four Forest high-rise office building , near the intersection of U.S. 75 and Interstate 635 at 12221 Merit . A Dallas Police spokesman says that it was a targeted shooting and not a random act . Two men , father and son , were the gunman 's victims . Both have been taken to a hospital and are in stable condition . The gunman was shot in an altercation with police . His condition is not known at this time . A witness tells KRLD-AM of Dallas that a bank customer went outside , then came back inside and said , `` You 'd better lock your doors . '' Another witness reported seeing a man sitting in a chair with blood all over his chest .

After a Devastating Birth Injury , Hope By DENISE GRADY DODOMA , Tanzania  Lying side by side on a narrow bed , talking and giggling and poking each other with skinny elbows , they looked like any pair of teenage girls trading jokes and secrets . But the bed was in a crowded hospital ward , and between the moments of laughter , Sarah Jonas , 18 , and Mwanaidi Swalehe , 17 , had an inescapable air of sadness . Pregnant at 16 , both had given birth in 2007 after labor that lasted for days . Their babies had died , and the prolonged labor had inflicted a dreadful injury on the mothers : an internal wound called a fistula , which left them incontinent and soaked in urine ... . Obstructed labor can kill the mother , too , or crush her bladder , uterus and vagina between her pelvic bones and the babys skull . The injured tissue dies , leaving a fistula : a hole that lets urine stream out constantly through the vagina . In some cases , the rectum is damaged and stool leaks out . Some women also have nerve damage in the legs . One of the most striking things about the women in Ward 2 was how small they were . Many stood barely five feet tall , with slight frames and narrow hips , which may have contributed to their problems . Girls not fully grown , or women stunted by malnutrition , often have small pelvises that make them prone to obstructed labor .
Or you can leave them both in the scientific theory category , which is what they are - theories , based off of assumptions and extrapolations - neither of which are void of error .
. The problem with science is its arrogance . It 's inability to see that truth can be found in other areas is a real handicap . Add to that theories like evolution that disguise themselves as science , and you have a real problem .
Sheer nonsense . What couints is the functioning of the system as a whole . Reducing it to subsytems , and those subsystems to material and mechanical components , is a task subordinate to the principal , primary objective , i.e. , an understanding of the whole , what is it that it is , why it does what it does , and how it does it . Very well then . The only system is the universe itslelf and we should not break it down to subsystems ( like cells , tissues , organs , individuals , biospheres , planets , suns , galaxies , local groups , etc ) We should simply understand it as a whole . We shall just grasp it in its wholeness . Oops cant do that can we since we are not omniscient . Oops I guess we have to reduce the problem to something we might actually be able to do . And guess what for certain questions some subsystems just might be more informative than others . What a crokpot you are WW .

So what do you think about the fact that this baby is much younger and smaller and far less developed than many of those who are aborted ? While this baby 21 week baby is living in one hospital room , down the hall a 22/23/24/25/26 ect week baby is being aborted because it was in the wrong place at the wrong time .
The grey area is of course if they lie and say it 's not religion , it 's just `` ethics '' , or `` whim '' . In that case it may not be illegal , but if I got that in writing , that my employee was refusing to take customers based on their own person ethics or on a whim , it makes it easy to fire them since it 's already established that they are being fired for reasons other than illegal reasons ( race/religion/color , etc . )

`` This started out as a documentary on gun violence in America , but the largest mass murder in our history was just committed -- without the use of a single gun ! Not a single bullet fired !

A thousand gun control laws would not have prevented this massacre . '' - Michael Moore What does this mean ? I do n't speak Michael Moore , can an anti-gunner please translate ?
Nobody considers a petri dish pregnant , but , thats not the point . Many people consider conception to be the beginning of life and anything that prevents that life from continuing to grow an abortion . As to your example , many would consider embrios stored for later IVF to be lives . Why else would they fight so hard to stop them from being destroyed .
So what ? Most of them are still getting killed with guns .
Or that they are dead , say from a genetic disease . So you are saying that genetics has nothing to do with genetics ? why do n't you address my point ? ... do you disagree ? How many genetic diseases do you know of that disallow people to breed ? How many of your friends ca n't breed ?
the child in the womb feels pain.. when you put the needle up there to try to give the child anestesia in the womb , the child moves away to not get stuck by the needle . Its because it feels pain.. this is after 18 weeks . this is a child in the womb..

Joe ; If it helps , I 'm a an ordained minister . I do n't care if those being married are `` believers '' or not ( like yourself ) all I care about is that those being married truly promice to love and care for each other . I know that you living in RI that the city of Windsor does n't help a whole lot , I would suggest Niagra for you because you 're so much closer to it , that 's if you 're interested in a Canadian Wedding . I will warn you though . Canadian marriage laws state that even though you do not have to be a resident of Canada to get married , you do have to be a Canadian resident for no less than one year to get divorced .

I must admit I am not sure the point of this thread . If one wants to say that Christians are hypocrites then I 'd agree . In fact , it has to be that way as the Bible clearly states we all fail when it comes to not sinning .

I checked my email today and noticed that I had received a few emails from the Brady Campaign . I 'll quote from the emails . `` Smile ... within the last hour , thanks to your help , we achieved a HUGE victory . By a vote of 52 to 47 , the Senate passed a renewal of the Assault Weapons Ban . Senators also agreed , 53 to 46 , to close the notorious 'gun show loophole ' that made it possible for criminals to buy firearms at gun shows without background checks .

In other words , what pieces of a `` traditional '' ceremony would you keep and which would you decide are too `` hetero '' ? I am sure this question seems bizarre but I thougt that would make it more thought provoking , not to mention I am serious . I am going to have a ceremony and was looking for ideas . Figured you guys might have some at the same time debate the issue of what makes a ceremony or union similar and different .

Unfossilized dinosaur bones have been found lying on top of the ground ... .they 've been found with soft tissue lodged in their bones ... they 've been found with their skin still attached ... .their soft , unfossilized eggs have been found with fully-formed embryos inside ... .there have been stones etched in ancient history depicting dinosaurs ... .they 've been drawn on cave walls and chiseled into walls long before they were dug up or identified . They 've been dated via carbon 14 at 9-15,000 years old ... .. What exactly is the evidence that dinosaurs are old ? Answer : more of Mr. Jack SQUAT . The only `` evidence '' science has is their NEED for dinosaurs to be old so that they can continue to fuel their propaganda machine . Evolutionary science has succesffuly hoodwinked the public into believing that dinosaurs are millions of years old , and they know if they admit this is false after all these years of fibbing to people , that the door for Creationism will be swung WIDE-OPEN ... ..and the scam-artist atheists in science and the media -- knowing how they love controlling poeple 's minds -- simply can not have people thinking this way , so they keep this charade going .

Well , your typical diety is generally immortal , omnipotent or nearly so , all knowing or nearly so , and concerned with humanity in some way . Creating the universe is a bonus , but not required .

I would like to see more conclusive data on the subject but most importantly a REAL plausible solution . I 'm not an expert but it does appear most scientists feel global warming is partly man-made . I do get a little sketched out when I see scientists are trying to restrict research for those that go against the theory . They may have strong arguments but that kinda BS really blows your credibility .
The one with the COMMON LAW -- but since you do n't have common sense , you probably never hoid of it . Ignorance of a contract 's obvious terms is never an excuse from being bound by them , once one consents to those legal and binding terms via accepting consideration ( i.e . engaging in `` sexual congress '' as you put it ) ; and if men think that sexual intercourse with a fertile woman does n't involve the risk of pregnancy , they 're inexcusably ignorant ... like you . This creates an implied-in-fact contract between the the man and the woman , with the party conceived being beneficiary and subject thereto ( i.e . parental rights over the child etc ) . Those are the clear and obvious terms , and therefore sexual intercourse is a contingency-agreement between the couple doing the coupling , and any potential offspring resulting therefrom . If they do n't like the terms , they can act to reduce the chances , or avoid the contract entirely through simply abstaining from the agreemetn -- but they ca n't pact for the wrongful death of the unwitting third party , in order for their own personal benefit at that child 's expense . Freedom is not carte blanche to do as one pleases , but only in a manner exclusive of the rights of others ; and so social contracts are not not strictly about what you want , it 's about what you CONSENT to -- whether by your actions or words -- consistent with those rights of everyone , whether pre- or post-natal ; a woman 's body is not another country , let alone another universe . The price of freedom is n't eternal vigilance -- it 's RESPONSIBILITY to others , for what you choose do with that freedom .
Right . And that is the reason for peer review . Creationists do n't subject their ramblings to peer review . That is why so much care is devoted to the proper construction of experiments to test the hypotheses by real scientists . Creationists just invent ad hoc stories without any experimentation .
Abram , I would suggest you study cognitive processes and the evolution of both the human body and the human mind . We take reality and describe it in our minds and thus form it into abstract concepts which we can operate with . Or , for more fun , just read a few articles on camouflage . You 'll see that you do n't become invisible by looking exactly like your surroundings , but by simply not looking like anything at all to the observer 's eye .
The partial birth abortion is rare , but it is not always used to save the mother 's life . At any rate , I may seem radical , but even if it is to save the mother 's life I think it should be disallowed , as it is a very cruel preocedure . Would you do that to a born baby ? Of course not . It 's very sickening that the so called `` land of the free '' would allow such a murderous procedure to be done .
Could it not be that skull shape has nothing to do with when a person lived ? ? Surely evolutionists do n't have the nerve to call these 6,000 year-old kow swamp people `` sub-human . '' And could it not be that Kow Swamp was a quasi-variation of homo erectus ?
Would you support mercy killing as a sole reason to perform an abortion ?
And what about the constitution of the United States ? Are not all people conceived in this country deserving of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness ?
To my mind the major point of debate is not to convince others , but to explore your own thoughts on a matter . You hit it right on the head , I notice the same thing .

Kelvin 's already proposed that the armed population of America has given serious protection to the US , specifically he mentioned Japan deciding not to invade . This is of course a nonsense . Iraq is a heavily armed nation -guns were given out to the general population before the USA invaded - ahem- I mean 'liberated ' . Did it stop the US ? Secondly , the specific example given ; that of Japan , is a nonsense . These same people who flung themselves in flying bombs , who refuesed to leave foxholes when starving - and would resort to cannibalism rather than surrender , he believes were worried about a few grannies carrying sawn-off shot-guns .
I 've having some difficulty arguing against an particularly dense creationist in how other sciences such as chemistry , geology , astronomy ( indirectly ) and physics all support evolution . Can anyone name any particular examples of where sciences that support evolution are used in an practical way ? I already have the geology for finding natural gas and oil and its relation to ancient flora , but I need more examples .

This is just crazy . This isnt the wild west so how come the solution of gun nuts is always that the good guys have shootouts with the bad guys ? thats what the gun nuts said after the vt massacre and now you want to do it with machine guns but you dont think about all the innocent people that could get killed in the crossfire .
Larry Flynt is both hilarious and full of sh*t. Two of my favorite qualities . I find that , in life , most things that do n't seem to be true and are not proven , are often the most true . Look at christianity - little or no proof - everyone believes . Amazing .
Do we really need to keep going in circles ? You 're setting up a false dichotomy . If the ToE is thrown out , it does not automatically mean that creationism is correct . Now stop repeating the same question .

Per your suggestion , I decided to get real . So here is the real Phyllis . I never said that you had to support anything .

JP , Carla and I started this conversation on another thread but you ca n't see the entire thing because admin deleted it . I was only able to re-post my last question to Carla and I am awaiting a response . I asked if anyone had seen the film and stated that I had not . She claimed the film was innacurate , with deceptive narration , misleading camera work , up to the point of fraudulence . That is pretty close to her exact words though I could n't remember the full quote . She cited a Planned Parenthood link but that was lost in the deletion of the other thread as well . I found Silent Scream on the internet and tried to watch it but I guess my hardware is not good enough because the pictures and sound were of poor quality .

The fact is that people are not prohibited from being married because of their sexual orientation .
You asked the question - why do people get upset by an everyday occurance . I answered . It is one thing for you not to believe it is a life - that is another argument . I mean , when my sister lost her dog , she just cried and cried . I did n't have any attachment to the dog - but I recognised hers . We pro-lifers believe that the aborted life is human life . So , you 've seen no evidence of protestors helping these women - were they allowed in the clinics to talk to the women ?
No one has tried to factor these things into any calculations .
i 'm strong in most subjects , but i have never quite understood science . i apologize .
Er , I guess I did n't really type out my thoughts very well . Sure `` we '' can study our origins and move into the future at the same time . `` We '' always have . There are professionel theologins and archeologists whom I would consider to actually make up the `` we '' . What concerns me , is that a great many people , who have no training whatsoever in either of the aforementioned professions ( myself included ) , have taken to drawing up sides based on which theory they favor . Ca n't we go back to simply following the findings of the experts that are studying the theories ? Neither side has been proven to date . One of them might be proven in the future , or more likely , neither will ever be proven . My favorite theory 's Dad can beat up your favorite theory 's Dad is stale and a complete waste of time and resources . It also creates a dividing wedge and too much negativity .
Here is Hans Fricke 's own story regarding the investigation into the coelacanths natural habitat which Nat Geo 's story is based upon . And notice the last paragraph in the story . The Fish That Time Forgot - Sidebar - MSN Encarta IT SAY 'S THIS : I confess I 'm sorry we never saw a coelacanth walk on its fins . Professor Smith himself nicknamed the coelacanth Old Fourlegs in the belief that the creature actually did walk upon the seafloor like a seal on its flippers . Alas , that does not seem to be the case . For every myth we dispelled , however , I 'm certain there are a dozen fascinating discoveries still to be made . In short , we have just begun to know the coelacanth .
no surprise that an industry run by criminals keeps the black market well stocked with guns while being cheered by the gun lobby
The problem with happenstance origins is that there is no evidence , and it 's simply not possible to falsify it . If we were able to prove so many scientific proceedures ( from abiogenesis to radiometric dating - all based on the presupposition that there is no God ) were indisputably true , then ID would be falsified . There is not enough supporting evidence for happenstance origins . Yet so much of happenstance origins is considered science , so all too often , there is no line between religion and science .
The creationists are hammered into a squelchy mess on every single occasion ! They have no evidence to back up their position , and very little knowledge of the subject , so lose every time . I 'm shocked that you would claim otherwise .
The lack of transitional series can not be explained as being due to the scarcity of material .

1 . By AMY GROSSMAN EVERY minute , a woman somewhere in the world dies in childbirth or from complications of pregnancy . But there is an inexpensive medicine that could save a great many of these womens lives  misoprostol . Misoprostol is a generic drug originally developed to treat ulcers , but its predominately used off-label for obstetrics . When a mother takes it immediately after delivery , it can effectively stop the leading cause of maternal death in most developing countries : postpartum hemorrhage or excessive bleeding . Whats more , its an easy-to-take tablet with a long shelf life , so its suitable for the vast majority of women who deliver at home , in remote villages , far from skilled medical care .
The whole point is that you ca n't use this warped version of the Razor for hypothesis testing . In the example , impetus was a hypothesis for a cause for movement . Ockham eliminated the hypothesis as a description of the phenonmenon .

`` Results . After adjustment , individuals in possession of a gun were 4.46 ( P < .05 ) times more likely to be shot in an assault than those not in possession . Among gun assaults where the victim had at least some chance to resist , this adjusted odds ratio increased to 5.45 ( P < .05 ) . Conclusions . On average , guns did not protect those who possessed them from being shot in an assault . Although successful defensive gun uses occur each year , the probability of success may be low for civilian gun users in urban areas . Such users should reconsider their possession of guns or , at least , understand that regular possession necessitates careful safety countermeasures .

I wasnt familiar with Poes Law either .

Doesnt really seem like that big of deal to me , but the atheist community seems to be increasingly fascinated with anything at all that allows them to mock Christianity . As this now famous genius Poe puts it ;

Even though our planet is getting warmer , it is still a lot cooler than it was 4000 years ago . I do not know whether the above statement is true or false , but for arguements sake , lets say it is true . OK , the planet is not as hot as 4000 years ago . Is that a good thing ? Maybe , but the planet is heating up . And it will not just reach the heat of 4000 years ago and stop . 4000 years ago there was n't as much toxic gases being released and other forms of pollution . I 'm afraid the planet will continue heating and heating . Are we going to sit back and watch our planet 's temp rise and rise ? Does it have to reach a temp higher than that of 4000 years ago before we acknowledge the problem ?

You mean Intelligent Design , and straight forward logical , rational , common sense arguments that require reason to move to the next step , instead of ideological consensus ... huh ? go figure ... Proponents of ID usually do n't argue religiosity or scripture , they let the empirical evidence prove it , funny ... that is what true science has always done . Verify the obvious , not ignore it in favor of some mindless postulations [ oddly ] convenient to how someone wants to live their life ; amazing how that works out ...

Lott , on the other hand , apparently lost a single footnot about how often guns just had to be brandishged in order to scare off an attacker . His other research has not been brought into question . The portion that WAS brought into question was removed from the research ( yep , that single sentence was deleted ) . It was not at all pivitol to the research , it was just a sidebar he found interesting . With lott , the question was `` can you prove this one sentence '' . with Bellesiles , the question was `` can you show me a single page in this book that does not contain an instance of academic fraud ? '' With lott , the figure apparently came from a phone poll he conducted himself , which he claims was lost in a hard drive crash . There have been people who came forward that remember taking the poll . Without actual tables of results , he has withdrawn the ascertation . In Ballesiles case , his missing date was show to have been lost over 100 years before he was born , and he has refused to withdraw his claims . You really do n't see the difference between these guys ?
Interesting how the study was set in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . They 're a city known for violence and gang-related issues .

I was watching the Bill Maher show today and they had Jane Fonda on . She mentioned that she has recently become a Christian and that HER god is one that supports a womens right to choice . Now there are so many problems with this that I do n't even know where to start . Not only that , I am saying this as almost a `` newbie '' Christian as in I do n't know everything there is to know about the Bible . However , I do know that the Christian God that is defined in the Bible is against abortion . Many argue that the Bible is not what the Christian God is because it has been translated into a meaningless document . How is this true when we have so many of the original scrolls ? Moreever , how can one claim what God thinks if they do n't have anything to base it on ? For example if you say the Bible is worthless , you are a Christian , and God believes abortion is ok ... then how did you come to this conclusion ? The Christian God talks about how one is created before they were put in the womb . God also talks about not killing . So if you wish to be Christian and for abortion you need to rethink one of those stances . God does n't conform to anyone .

So they ( pro-life peeps ) say abortion is murder . Of course , you can only murder people . So their rule is that fetuses ( feti ? ) are people also . But then they ca n't explain why fetuses are n't listed on the US Census , or why there is n't a funeral every time a woman has a miscarriage . Pretty much , along with the rules of having children , you would have to acquire the birth certificate during conception , you would have to pay taxes for children , even if you 're only pregnant , etc . Or am I missing something ? Care to clarify , anybody who disagrees ?
When that did n't work , they tried to pass laws that required `` equal time '' for the teaching of fundamentalist Christian mythology as science ( `` Creation science '' ) .

A baby may look helpless . It cant walk , talk , think symbolically or overhaul the nations banking system . Yet as social emulsifiers go , nothing can beat a happily babbling baby . A baby is born knowing how to work the crowd . A toothless smile here , a musical squeal there , and even hard-nosed cynics grow soft in the head and weak in the knees . In the view of the primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy , the extraordinary social skills of an infant are at the heart of what makes us human . Through its ability to solicit and secure the attentive care not just of its mother but of many others in its sensory purview , a baby promotes many of the behaviors and emotions that we prize in ourselves and that often distinguish us from other animals , including a willingness to share , to cooperate with strangers , to relax ones guard , uncurl ones lip and widen ones pronoun circle beyond the stifling confines of me , myself and mine . As Dr. Hrdy argues in her latest book , Mothers and Others : The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding ,  which will be published by Harvard University Press in April , human babies are so outrageously dependent on their elders for such a long time that humanity would never have made it without a break from the great ape model of child-rearing . Chimpanzee and gorilla mothers are capable of rearing their offspring pretty much through their own powers , but human mothers are not .
For example , I do n't believe for a minute that the oil deposits were formed from the liquified remains of mass dinosaur graves from 65 million years ago , but I do trust and respect the scientifically proven techniques for locating and assessing the quality of that oil .

Mach , quite simply , many hundreds of thousands of soldiers and people observed the events you listed . But , Mach , you never answered my question - instead adding your two cents with unrelated events that we have many human eye-witness accounts from . Can one observe any of the three things I listed above ? Do we have any eye-witness accounts from humans about these events ? No .
The fact that restricting access to abortion has tragic side effects does not , in itself , show that the restrictions are unjustified , since murder is wrong regardless of the consequences of prohibiting it ;
Early Christian authorities rejected marriage , for the very reason that it was Goddess-oriented , and also on grounds of eschatology . Since they believed that the world was going to end at any moment , according to Jesus promise , they saw no point in continuing another generation-for their savior specifically stated that the world would end in his own generation ( Luke 9:27 ) . However , as the decades wore on and the world did not end , fathers of the church turned even more firmly against marriage because they thought universal virginity was needed to bring about the promised kingdom of Christ . St. Jerome said the purpose of every godly man should be to cut down with the ax of Virginity the wood of Marriage. St. Ambrose called marriage a crime against God . Origen said , Matrimony is impure and unholy , a means of sexual passion. Tatian said marriage is a polluted and foul way of life ,  and Tertullian described it as an obscenity , a moral crime , more dreadful than any punishment or any death. St. Augustine flatly declared marriage a sin . Saturninus explained that God made only two kinds of people , good men and evil women , and marriage turned good men toward evil . Jesus himself said there could be no marriage in heaven ( Matthew 22:30 , Mark 12:25 ) . St. Bernard wrote that it is easier for a man to bring the dead back to life than to live with a woman without endangering his own soul . For many centuries therefore , marriage remained outside the church , under the auspices of common law . It was grudgingly accepted by religious authorities only when new laws restricted a wifes rights of ownership and inheritance , taking the means of independence away from women and turning them over to men . Priests had abandoned the early churchs rule of celibacy and had begun to take wives in the 5th and 6th centuries . But in the 11th century , the church decided to forbid clerical marriages , because they produced children to inherit property . When an unmarried priest died , all his property reverted to the church . Therefore , new papal decretals commended clergymen to turn their wives out on the street and sell their children as slaves . Some of the wives stayed on as concubines , though they were disinherited in the churchs favor . By this means the church acquired a great new influx of wealth , although the women and children who were left destitute suffered terribly . Marriage continued under the common law up to the 13th century , having no endorsement by canon law . Historian F.C . Conybeare says , Nothing is more remarkable than the tardiness with which liturgical forms for the marriage ceremony were evolved by the church. The earliest approach to a Christian ceremony was a simple blessing of the newlyweds in facie ecclesiae-on the porch , outside the church door-to prevent the so-called pollution of Gods house . Though this blessing technically violated canon law , in 1215 the fourth Lateran Council granted it legal status because it had become too popular to ignore . It was only in the 16th century that the church finally made the priestly blessing mandatory ( and , of course lucrative ) , refusing to recognize common-law marriages any more .
Apparently I spoke well past your head ... not my fault . Any ways ... The Bible falls silent on the issue of abortion . You could n't find me a verse that dirour life coectly condemns abortion if yunted on it . And if the Bible is silent then what about theologians ? Once again ... nothing . Keep `` cracking up '' ... I suppose it is the only thing you can do .
Well I ca n't agree to that , the 'evidence ' for ID was all over the place before Darwin came up with a naturalistic solution . Evidence sufficient for proof does not exist but inferential evidence does exist anytime you observe biology . I made a point a while ago about semantics , it was countered as a point mattering to evolution by pointing out it was just semantics which I quite agree with . The point still stands that people can hardly speak about biology without using words like 'designed for ' and 'because ' implying purpose . You do n't hear things like that about geology and chemistry for a reason , they are not complex functioning systems which fulfill a purpose .

the differences between humans and all other members of the animal kingdom are near irreconcilable . chimps really dont even come close . in fact , humans are capable of putting habits into other animals ( and other humans ) that actually can override their natural instincts .
The second meaning stipulates `` biology '' , which , to anyone who knows how to use a dictionary , means that the number two meaning , not the number one , is the specifically biological meaning for the word evolution .

So if same-sex relationships are legally recognized as `` marriage , '' the idea of marriage as a sexually exclusive and faithful relationship will be dealt a serious blow . Adding monogamy and faithfulness to the other pillars of marriage that have already fallen will have overwhelmingly negative consequences for Americans ' physical and mental health .
I am intrigued to see that both sides have to be black or white . Either the creationist says the Bible is true down to the last detail or the anti-creationists say it is totally false and absolutely nothing as described ever happened .

Does the term `` evolution '' refer to ONLY the `` advances '' of life over time ?
What 's the difference between humans and chimps ? According to the blowhards in the scientific world for the past 60 years , they said it was genetic mutations . But according to these three articles , including a September 2006 Science article it 's cooked food and fire ... ..you see these things cause our genes to be expressed differently . ... We think gene expression is a major part of what separates chimps and humans , '' said Kevin White , an associate professor of genetics , ecology and evolution at Yale University in the United States . When we looked at gene expression , we found fairly small changes in 65 million years of macaque , orangutan and chimpanzee evolution , '' said Dr Yoav Gilad of the University of Chicago , lead author of the study . But he said it was followed by quick changes in specific groups of genes known as transcription factors , which control the expression of other genes , since humans diverged from their ape ancestors during the last 5 million years . `` This rapid evolution in transcription factors occurred only in humans , '' Gilad added in a statement . ...

Parallels that Are n't Parallel The key question in any slippery slope appeal is whether the two situations are truly similar in a morally relevant way . If not , then the illustration is guilty of a logical slippery slope fallacy . The analogy fails and the argument falls apart . Are there important differences between pregnancy and kidnapping ? Yes , many . First , the violinist is artificially attached to the woman . A mother 's unborn baby , however , is not surgically connected , nor was it ever `` attached '' to her . Instead , the baby is being produced by the mother 's own body by the natural process of reproduction .
`` 'Arms ' in this context were military arms not the personal weapons of private individuals . The context of 'depriving of the whole nation of arms ' was the refusal of the British to conscript Indians into the British Army during the First World War . Gandhi was an extreme anti-militarist . The statement is odd coming out of him , but he used the circumstance for political purposes to advance the cause of Home Rule and Independence . '' http : //www.potowmack.org/thequotes.html # gandhi

Nuclear weapons argument is moot . There is only one vendor in this country . You or anyone else does not have the right to make a vendor sell their private property against thier will . The only vendor in this country will not sell nuclear weapons to anyone other than the Department of Defense . The only vendor in this country is quite happy having only one customer . Until you can find a vendor , the nuclear weapons argument is just useless chit chat .

What you say about a nose is of course an aesthetic judgment and entirely subjective . But we are not talking about noses here ; it 's the idea of perfection we have in focus . Ideas are internal to the thinker and it is merely our judgment that relates to the external world . So we could have a perfect idea of a perfect being but still have faults in our judgement . Having an idea of perfection does not imply that the thinker is perfect in some way .
`` State legislators have also rediscovered their political bullet-proof vests as the gun lobby has pushed aggressively to extend conceal-and-carry to college campuses , taverns , and the workplace . `` Since the mass fatal shooting at Virginia Tech in 2007 , gun-rights advocates have made an all-out effort to allow students to carry hidden firearms  on the dubious theory that students would be better protected from mass killers . But 22 states saw the folly of this idea and defeated it , even in strong gun-rights states such as Louisiana , South Carolina , and Oklahoma .

In addition you would have to make possesion of a firearm illegal , then you have to balance defending your property with revealing you are commiting a crime ( will be fairly obvious if you use one and you would have to get rid of it anyway when forensics investigate the crime scene ) . Would also have to look at countries that have carried out sucessful ones to see if there are any little points or mistakes to pick up .

I like this concept . It seems to do a good job of explaining how microbes adapt so quickly to antibiotics , for example . Our blood cells multiply fairly quickly , but the genetic makeup does not change from one lymphocyte `` generation '' to the next . Yet we know that over our lifetimes they `` learn '' to produce new types of defenses against diseases . These adaptations are clearly not genetic , but they are a form of micro-evolution .

POLICE raids and an undercover operation have netted more than 100 illegal firearms and thousands of rounds of ammunition in a crackdown on an alleged Wollongong-based gun trafficking network . A Heckler and Koch MP5 9mm submachine gun - capable of firing 800 rounds a minute and used by armed forces and police in 40 countries - was also found , police said . Among the guns allegedly bought from the gang was a World War II Bren Light machine gun capable of firing up to 520 rounds a minute . The haul also included bullet proof vests and night vision telescopic sights , it is alleged .

I do n't think all science is a sham ... however I do believe that anything that 's called a `` fact '' should be testable and/or observable ... yet the types of mutations that are required for cumulative selection have never been observed . The fact that there are many in the scientific community who are now looking at regulatory genes should tell you something -- the old way does n't hold water . And this is because it is now known that body parts are not made up by placing one gene on top of another . People can still be atheists -- they just ca n't blame it on neodarwinsim .

Are we so arrogant that we assume we are the only animals capable of thought or choices ?

I think the argument that a woman has the right to determine what is done with her bodily resources during pregnancy lacks justification . For those who do : Do you assume that this is an absolute right and the moral good at any time and in every circumstance ( even before the 14th amendment existed and even in countries where it does not apply ) ? Do you agree that breast milk is a bodily resource of the mother ? If the answers to these questions are yes : Imagine a time when artificial formula did not exist . According to this reasoning it would be legitimate for a woman who suddenly decided she did not want to donate her bodily resources to withhold nutrition until the infant died . In fact , she should be able to dispose of that tissue some call infants through any of the same means as done in abortions ( that would be sticking scissors in the head , burning , ect ) . Infanticide would be a moral option for any woman who does not wish to donate bodily fluids to her newborn parasite and does not have access to formula at any moment because of various reasons . I am sure there are women in the world today who do not have access to formula . Are these women justified in deeming these babies as life unworthy of life and disposing of them ?

You seem to think that any time someone is killed , the reasoning behind it was that the perpetrator `` devalued human life '' . If that was the case , gun manufacturers , car manufacturers , breweries , and cigarette manufacturers would `` devalue human life '' simply because they make these products knowing that people will die from their use/abuse . And the government would `` devalue human life '' by letting these companies operate under it . We do not go targeting innocent civilians .
Abortion very often is touted as an economic solution for poor women , i.e. , `` Black women . '' Strident , pro-abortion feminists cry for abortion as a `` right '' for which they must fight to keep . Unfortunately , this misleading notion has been embraced by some people in the Black community as a civil right .

So contemporary arguments for intelligent design in both biology and the physical sciences are not only testable ; they make predictions and are falsifiable in principle . Of course , if the arguments are true , then they are falsifiable only in principle , but not in fact ( hardly a weakness in a scientific theory ) . We have given only two examples here . There are many other design arguments in biology , origin-of-life studies , and paleontology that are also empirically testable and that make predictions . Therefore , honest commentators should stop claiming that ID is empirically untestable , or that it makes no predictions . The claim itself has been tested and falsified . Its time to move on to other and more pertinent aspects of the debate over intelligent design .

If you mean that , literally , `` most '' people stayed away , then I suppose you 're right . But , if that is what you really meant then it is a profoundly weak statement because `` most '' people `` stay away '' from all movies on any given weekend . In comparison to other movies , however , I 'd say that Capitalism : A Love Story did quite well for a documentary : it tied for # 6 in terms of total box-office sales this past weekend , and it was # 4 in terms of per-theater box-office sales . More importantly , however , I 'd say that box-office sales are NOT a good quality measure for documentaries in the first place !
I have indeed unlocked the secret code of deception of the scietific underworld . It 's an ugly place where the facts are concealed by complete and utter nonsense . It 's a sleight-of-hand maneuver that all of science is evidently in on ... and it 's a tactic that Satan himself would be proud of .

But to take the Apostle 's analogy further , if I see something , and know what it is , and you ca n't measure it , because you were n't there , does n't make what I see false ... as you would believe - seeing as you seem to suggest that in the physical world truth is what can be measured/tested .
Umpteen scientific disciplines can be dwarfed by emotion and money , both of which saturate evolutionary study .

and Gould himself : UNDIRECTED . In a sense , the specter of directed variability threatens Darwinism even more seriously than any putative failure of the other two postulates . Insufficient variation stalls natural selection ; saltation deprives selection of a creative role but still calls upon Darwins mechanism as a negative force . With directed variation , however , natural selection can be bypassed entirely . If adaptive pressures automatically trigger heritable variation in favored directions , then trends can proceed under regimes of random mortality ; natural selection , acting as a negative force , can , at most , accelerate the change . ( Gould 2002 : 145 )
Again , I salute you , Maximus , the Jesuitical application of the word `` ephebophilia , '' which I have also seen used by a high official in the Roman Catholic Church hoping to triviliaze pedophilia in the Church by calling it `` ephebophilia , '' and urging that this be considered a lesser crime -- if , indeed , a crime at all .
frankly the idea that the repeal of the AWB had any effect at all is ludicrous . The AWB was a piece of legislative garbage that was passed as a feel good measure . No more , no less . The entire thing was idiotic . I have an extensive collection of guns . Everythign from dueling pistols to a minigun . I could not always tell what was a `` pre ban '' assault weapon and a `` post ban '' non assault weapon . You had to check the serial numbers to be sure , then check the manufacturers tech sheet to see where that serial number fell . I do think that it is interesting that the Mexicans are blaming the US for their violence problem . The Fully automatic AK-47s used in the beverly hills shootout were smuggled into the country from Mexico . Apparently the mexicans are exporting full auto weaponry and importing semi auto . The truth probably lies somewhere in between . There is no question that mexico has a SERIOUS violence problem . Most mexican cartels used automatic weapons in the 80 's and 90 's , then their use fell off ... probably as they learned that automatic weapons were a good way to chew up all your ammo and not accomplish a damn thing . Now they are downgrading to lighter stuff , and many of those lighter weapons are supplied by the US .
Senior police officers have been warning for several months that a growing number of teenagers in big cities are becoming involved in gun crime . The age of victims and suspects has fallen over the past three years as the availability of firearms in some cities has risen . Illegal firearms have become increasingly accessible to younger offenders who appear more likely to use these firearms recklessly ,  a report on gun crime commissioned by the Home Office cautioned last year .
No Jim , by reason . You can not know the unknowable , it 's a contradiction . To claim anything about the unknowable implies knowledge of the unknowable . Me saying it has no relevance to it 's being rational .

Possibly , but also are n't the people most likely to start `` legitimate '' business selling these drugs the people who are doing it already ? I mean , these are the people who already have a supply line and infrastructure .

It would still then be funding the same criminal activities .
Whether or not there are innaccuracies in the Bible is hottly debated , but it is not really the point I was trying to make .

There is nothing inherently irrational about the theory of evolution being used to explain life in the physical unviverse , yet creation begins with an irrational premise , that we can `` know '' about the `` unknowable '' . It can certainly be a false theory , however , you can rationally show that it is or is not ( to the degree determined by your evidence ) .
If only she 'd been allowed to have a gun she could have what ? Shot or threatened to shoot someone ? `` Boys and girls as young as 10 '' , the story says . They threw `` rocks and eggs '' at her house . They do n't kill you for that in England , Texas maybe .
I 'm sure there have been more repeat murderers than innocent people put to death . As far as the cost goes , is that really an issue ? Execution Room = $ 10,000 Stainless Steel Table = $ 2,000 Leather Straps = $ 200 Lethal Injection Chemicals = $ 5,000 Knowing this person will never possibly be able to kill again = PRICELESS
I do n't think the point was to come up with an exact number of gun laws . The point was to show that the 20,000 figure often claimed by the pro-gun side is very doubtful . But the total number of gun laws may not tell us a whole lot . 100 cities could pass laws to require waiting periods . That would count as 100 gun laws . Or the Federal Government could pass one law to require a waiting period throughout the nation . It would count as one law but would have more of an effect than 100 separate city laws .
Why on earth would a woman come out now , admit to an abortion she had 30 years ago , when it was illegal , and become the focus of unscrupulous media attention for the next year ? Attention that would be very damaging to someone that she cares about ? Why on earth would any woman do that ?
As for the other gods , well since they do n't interact with our world they do n't really matter at all . they could just as well not be there , and life as we know it would be the same . a question that asks `` is there a god ? '' is answered `` it does n't matter '' .

Foolish Clergymen . How can this work ? How can you take something as serious as the supposed Holy word of God and say that ? I mean if you cant take something as simple as what is said in genesis and beleive it then why the XXXX would people beleive in anything else the bible has to say ? If there is falsehood in it then how can any of it be trusted ? If the Creation , Adam and Eve , Noah and the ark are just there to serve as the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation . That is Absolutly ridiculous . Why stop with that ? Why not continue on to say that the story of Jesus was jsut a way for man to relate to God ? Oh but then it continues doesnt it ? Yes it does ! Nothing in the bible is to be beleived unless it is all beleived as a whole . It is torn apart . You can not pick and choose parts of this religion as it fits your needs . It simply must be all or nothing . Otherwise you are wasting your time .
The definition of deter is `` To prevent or discourage from acting , as by means of fear or doubt '' . A lock does nothing to induce fear or doubt in an attacker , all it can do is slow them down . As said before the best lock is only as strong as the door and screws used to hold it in place , so their effectiveness is highly questionable .
Come to think of it , if we remove all religious-based laws , why are they pushing for gays to be included in MARRIAGE , one of the most legally oppressive institutions there is ?
Even though the Revision argument may have merit , it is not what the focus should be on . Proponents of marraige equality should be getting the message out that ballot box discrimination is not OK . This is the argument that should be taken to the courts . It should be made clear that civil rights are not a voting matter , and that even if 90 % of the people voted to ban gay marriage , targeting a historically vulnerable group and stripping them of a fundamental right is not something that should be put to a vote . That 's what the courts are for , to protect the minority from the tyranny of the majority .
Rationalization . Either you believe the Bible is correct in every detail or you do n't . The meaning of the verses are quite clear , but you `` interpret '' them to mean what they do not say . Before Copernicus , there was no concept of orbiting planets . And yet you cling to the idea of a flood that covered mountains . The bottom line is that you pick and choose what you will and will not believe . You are quite selective about your Bible belief .

What I heard was that they had caught the guy , and had him pinned onto the floor of the train when one officer shot him at point blank range five times . Which does n't sound reasonable to me .

Doctors said an 8-year-old girl would never see more than light and dark , but a Missouri family said seeing is believing . The family of Savannah Watring decided to take a chance on an experimental stem-cell procedure in China . `` I kept wondering if I 'm doing the right thing . Being blind was her world . And I kept thinking , 'What if I 'm doing wrong by taking her world from her ? ' '' grandmother Ravana Watring told KMBC 's Bev Chapman . Savannah 's grandmother , father and aunt took the 8-year-old for seven stem-cell infusions at a hospital in Quingdoa , China . The result is that Savannah can see . Doctors said it would take three to six months before they would see any change , but after Savannah 's fourth treatment , something amazing happened in an elevator -- she saw herself for the first time . `` When Savannah was facing the mirror , she said , 'Hi . ' Brent looked at me , and I looked at Brent . I did n't know whether to laugh or cry , '' Ravana Watring said . Now , Savannah is learning shapes , numbers and letters .
Should we allow health-care to the homeless , and illegal ? For the homeless : Yes . However , I think that it should be based upon how they got to be homeless . Because , sometimes , it 's their fault . And in those times , I do n't think that we should have to cover all of their health-care . DO I believe that we should cover some of it ? Yes , because it 's the right thing to do , and it is what our nation claims . Equal rights . However , I have nothing to say on the issue of the illegal , because a member in my family was recently attacked ( stabbed ) by one , and the wounds are too fresh , and if I speak on it , I will be speaking with prejudice , so I will leave that subject alone . But , what are your views ?
What laws are these that you speak of ? Kindly provide the bill name and number so you have some actual proof and are n't simply parroting from the fear-mongering Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center . During World War II the American people rounded up Japanese-Americans and herded them into concentration camps because you were at war with the people of Japan and thought that they were the sleeping enemy even though they had no proof . What you 're speaking of is no different than this . The way I see it Brady , your hatred for guns and gun owners is so overwhelming and logic defying , that you 'd be perfectly alright with unleashing a life-ending pandemic plague on the people of earth if you believed it would put an end to all gun owners everywhere .
An independant perspective does n't make it a good thing . Politicians that propose anti-gun legislation do n't have to live in the real world with those of us that the bill will affect , they should n't be allowed to propose it .

The organism can survive in the environment by a loss of genetic information i.e . the loss of a function , for example the loss of wings of a beatle on a windy island helps it to survive . If they had wings , they may be blown into the ocean and drown . Over time , you may get a population of wingless beatles - the adaption would be mutation by natural selection . Not evolution . Which also fits beautifully with the creation account .

It is also undisputed in the scientific/biological community that the point of conception is the commencement of the biological life of a member of it 's species .

I 've advocated photographing and fingerprinting for all handgun purchases .

So , by many patriarchal religious groups , women are still considered chattel , breeding stock .

2 . By HELEN EPSTEIN EVEN as the United States Agency for International Development sends hundreds of millions of dollars worth of food to developing countries , a strange but important nutritional problem is being overlooked : The children of women who suffer from severe stress and poverty sometimes seem to give up and refuse to eat . Studies suggest that this stems from maternal detachment  the breakdown of emotional connection between traumatized mothers and their children . ... .. Sally Grantham-McGregor , a child health researcher working in Jamaica , demonstrated that teaching poor mothers the basic techniques of mothering  holding and playing , and communicating with smiles , gestures and questions  could help their ailing children achieve remarkable developmental gains . And these gains were much greater than those that could have been achieved with food and medical care alone . Today , Unicef and the World Health Organization agree that counseling should be an important part of food aid programs . Once feeding programs are in place , it costs very little to train community health workers . One organization , Play Therapy Africa , which runs feeding and counseling centers in Ethiopia , is training aid workers in these methods in 50 centers . The one-time expense of $ 278,000  the cost of training and monitoring the health workers  is a pittance compared with the millions of dollars spent on food alone . Unfortunately , most aid economists overlook counseling . When the journal Lancet recently reviewed strategies to reduce malnutrition , these methods werent mentioned at all . Vulnerable children require more than food and medicine ; they need affection . To nurture them , we need to nurture the mothers on whom their lives depend .
This would explain why there are virtually no intermediate fossils .

You can ignore the statement by D.J.Futuyma and identical ones made by Gould , Mayr , Dawkins , Dobzhansky and others but not without departing from mainstream evolutionary biology .
Why would you expect this ?
You could claim it , but unless you justify the claim rationally , why would anyone believe you ? Aha , if you said `` god could allow it '' , then you still have n't explained HOW , since there also is no evidence of a god .

I find it interesting that the slippery slope fallacy keeps popping up again and again in the arguments of pro-gun activists even after the Heller decision . In that decision , the Supreme Court recognized an individual right to own guns but rejected the slippery slope argument that has been used by the gun lobby for years . I also find it hard to believe some of what gets posted in favor of the slippery slope argument- such as claims that Sarah Brady wants all guns to be banned which are contradicted by quotes by her in credible online sources and also such statistics as `` [ i ] t is estimated that there are between 22,000 and 30,000 gun laws on the books in America '' which have little basis in fact : `` The belief that there are approximately 20,000 gun-control laws in the United States has become received wisdom ... .. But as it turns out , there appears to be little basis for the number ... . Since the early 1980s , the National Rifle Association has mounted a very successful campaign to encourage state governments to enact 'preemption ' laws , forbidding local governments from enacting their own gun laws . Today , more than 40 states preempt all or most local gun-control laws , which has likely reduced the overall number of local gun laws ... .Clearly the 20,000 figure is more a product of advocacy than science . And however it was initially derived , the trend toward preemption of local laws has substantially reduced the total . The most informative answer to the question of 'how many gun-control laws ? ' is then 'about 300 major state and federal laws , and an unknown but shrinking number of local laws . ' `` http : //www.brookings.edu/es/urban/pu ... s/gunbook4.pdf So why does the slippery slope fallacy keep appearing despite a Supreme Court ruling that stands in the way of it becoming a reality , a decline in the number of gun laws , and little or no credible evidence to suggest that gun control advocates really do intend to ban all guns ? Could it be that pro-gun extremists find it necessary to resort to the slippery slope fallacy because they find it otherwise difficult to make a convincing argument against reasonable and common sense gun laws aimed at protecting law abiding citizens from gun violence and the misuse of firearms ?
What ever happened to taking responsibility for one 's actions in this country ?

Before this thread is finished I 'll be able to quote one of you subconsciously showing that you think the woman is invisible .
A woman 's rights over her body are n't absolute at all . When a woman who 's OD'ed is brought to a hospital , they take steps to save her ... they do n't just say `` She 's a druggie , she 's obviously sick of life , we 'll respect her right to die '' . Even if she recovers , and lucidly announces the same intent , they will take steps to stop her . It is because it is un-natural . It is un-natural to kill another human or to harm another human . People do it , but we do n't just accept it ... we try and put these people into a place where they 're not going to do it again . Further , if a woman smokes , her 'right to smoke ' might impinge upon my right to be in a smoke free environment . Why is it that restaurants ( at least in this country ) now have to be smoke free ? Why is my right greater than hers ? I might point out that the woman in question has every right to go down and file a DNR and a living will , and then the medical responders would be required by law to adhere to it . If she went and OD'ed again , and was going to die , they would have to let her die ... in effect she has gone through all neccessary legal steps to end her life . When a woman goes into a clinic to have an abortion , she also complies with the law , but for some reason , there will always be someone who does n't think she should be allowed the right to do so . Restaurants are not required to be smoke free . There are some local ordinances that may require it , but it is not a federal law . Workplaces , yes , restaurants , no . Walk into any diner in say , Cheyenne , WY to see it I 'm wrong . The reasons a restauranteur might decide to make his establishment non-smoking are numerous . The fact is , in most venues , the smoker is the minority , and so it only makes sense . My own opinion is that , while a smoker can last an hour or so for dinner without dying for a smoke , some vehement non-smokers could not last two minutes if they were within a half mile of a lit cigarette . ( you know the type , the suburban soccer mom who coughs on sight of a cigarette , the one who will traipse through a discount motel at midnight looking at 10 rooms because none of them `` smell right '' )
... That 's the point . It was n't designed , and it was evolved to be a carnivore . `` Ready to go '' , in the sense that living things are equipped with a means of making small errors which are used by natural selection to make new structures . ... The new ones evolved by mutation . Sometimes , we can even observe that happening , or trace the mutation back to a known ancestor . Would you like to learn about it ? ..

You do n't even take into consideration the possibility that Japan could have a higher mass murder rate- perhaps the same as the US- if guns were freely available in that country . You have a lot of explaining to do if you expect me to buy what you 're trying to peddle .

The author is arguing that gun control in rural areas does not constitute crime control in urban areas but somehow you try to spin that into making it sound as if the author is making some blanket statement against all gun control .
It did n't work ? Well , her mom should have just left her in the woods to die . I hear that one 's pretty surefire . In all honesty , there is nothing distressing about this story .

If Darwinian evolution was as secure as it 's proponents claim , they simply would not be afraid of comparisons to ID in school classrooms .
Look , the use of certain words can be a tricky thing since words carry connotations . There are often multiple definitions of words since people use them in different ways . One of the list of definitions which I showed you of the word `` a human '' had two versions ( from the American Heritage Dictionary ) - one purely a scientific one and one defining a human as `` a person '' . In a scientific context , I and at least certain other pro-choice supporters would have no problem calling a fetus `` a human '' . But the abortion debate is not a scientific context is it ? It is a context about rights . There , the second definition of `` a person '' is what most of us have in mind and use . If you want a discussion about biology - i.e . homo sapiens vs other mammals , then one might use the term `` a human '' in its most broadest sense since it is being compared to other species . When the topic is not science but politics , the word `` a human '' carries a lot of other connotations that go beyond the scientific definition . We often speak of `` human rights '' , `` humanity '' , etc . The scientific definition does not and can not carry all of the underlying attached meanings behind those phrases . That is why the second dictionary definition of `` a person '' is much more relevant .
The first one is moderately valid ... the rest are straw men .
Creationism fully accounts for all possible scenarios , that is why it is foolish to attempt disprove it or pit it against science . I have literally heard the idea that God created the earth some thousands of years ago and all evidence you see to the contrary was placed there by God as a test of people 's faith . Now what are you going to say to that anyone ?

But I see two people involved here . Whether the women is better off or not is irrelevant to me . She has no right to kill the other just like you have no right to kill your neighbor .

Actually the Apocrypha is made up of pre-Christian texts , and late 4th century is a bit of a stretch for the new testament , certainly all its component texts were widely accepted by the 2nd century . I do n't whether it is `` generally accepted '' that the text was altered , it seems to me that you are projecting your own views based on the hypotheses of some scholars on to Biblical scholarship in general .
We now know that human nucleotides exist in large linked clusters or blocks , ranging in size from 10,000 to a million . These linkage blocks are inherited as a single unit , and never break apart . This totally negates one of the most fundamental assumptions of the theorists  that each nucleotide can be viewed as an individually selectable unit . Dr. J.C. Sanford ( geneticist ) ( Of course this annihilates the whole theory as well . )
That 's a good argument , just post a link and hope that people accept it as a real argument . Show me where a new body part has evolved .
And yet the US still has a much higher gun crime rate despite having a very high incarceration rate compared to other developed nations with a lot less gun violence . Get a clue .
I 'm not necessarily calling this evolution ... .I 'm just simply pointing out that acquired traits can be inherited . There is no other way to describe this other than Lamarckism .
If any human attempts to answer in God 's stead , that person would likely not be qualified to answer . One can speculate however . God already had angels within his kingdom when he made man . Some angels felt that God loved his humans more than themselves . In their jealous vanity , they rebelled against God . Bad idea , considering his power and all . God hates vanity . Thus he condemned Satan to rule over hell . When man disobeyed God 's rule concerning partaking of the fruit of knowledge , God made a pact with man that gave him the burden of choice . He must choose right from wrong . Suffer the consequences of bad choices , reap the benefits of righteousness . Satan just happens to be there to take care of those who choose the wrong path . One mistake humans seem to make often is considering themselves capable of understanding the logic of God . Of course if one does not believe in God , no need to worry about it .
If one removes God from the picture of moral discussion , one removes the possibility that there are any such things as moral truths ; the possibility that there are , in fact , right answers to moral questions .
You 're laboring under the misapprehension that if the world really were a few thousand years old and we all sprang whole out of nothingness and we really were all descended from a single couple , scientific investigations would n't reveal that truth . But it would . It would be very , very easy to scientifically confirm a biblical earth . That has n't happened because we 're not living on one . Whatever problems that causes are yours to deal with , not mine .
I think that Comrade Brian is pulling our collective legs by pretending to be a die-hard , uninformed , living-in-denial communist , when in fact he 's a just another guy trying to have a laugh by trolling the boards . I truly find it hard to believe that anyone could be so completely uninformed about capitalism and socialism .
My point in starting the thread is not merely that Christians fall short of their aspirations . No ... .this is worse . Because this particular U.S . Senator , an avowed conservative Christian , has actively worked to restrict the rights of others to marry , supposedly in the name of `` protecting '' or `` defending '' marriage , while at the same time undermining his own marriage . He makes a pretense , for political gain I suspect , of `` defending marriage '' by playing to people 's anti-gay prejudices while himself undermining marriage in his real life . That 's hypocrisy , and it 's dishonesty .
It appears that a Law or theorem is fundamentaly based on faith . If you could n't build on the belief that something will happen , we 'd be stuck never forming new hypostheses . You may have it backwards .
Scientists have turned to chickens to help them understand why some people are struck down by severe allergies . The birds have a `` fossilised '' version of the key molecule responsible for severe allergic reactions in humans . King 's College London researchers say their findings , published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry , could guide the hunt for future treatments . Experts said the work offered `` exciting new avenues '' for research into preventing allergies developing . The molecule in birds , called IgY , appears to be an ancient forerunner of a similar human molecule called IgE - one of the culprits when the immune system goes into overdrive during asthma attacks or anaphylactic shock . The King 's team are trying to find out why IgE causes a problem , while IgY does not .
Hello everyone , first off I 'd like to say I 'm an evangelical Christian , so of course I believe in Jesus ' existence , just as I believe the Word is the infallible Word of God . I have heard lately of people who actually argue that Jesus did not exist . I decided to start this thread to see what everyone thinks . Do you think Jesus existed ? Do you think he existed as described in the bible ( Son of God , etc . ) ? If not , why not ? Here is my view - the Bible tells me that Jesus existed , and is the Son of God , as well as my Lord and Savior , and that is really all I need to know . Discuss .

Human beings are naturally chaotic and posses a strong sense of `` evil '' , so how do we stop self destruction ? The Bible . The bible was created for control , without the bible , without the promise of being rewarded for your kindness and brotherhood on earth , humans would have no reason to surpress their natural tendencies . If there was no bible and no promise of an after life why would a slave want to endure such a horrible life ? He would n't , he would kill himself or his master , but no , If he does good on earth and believes in the `` lord '' he will be rewarded . CONTROL . In the book the Lord of the Flies the young boys are stranded by themselves with no adults , they start off normal , as if there were adults still present . But , as time goes on , the lack of an authoritve figure begins to change their mental state . They become what humans naturally are , primal and sinister . The point is that without adults the children changed , became evil , so just as the children need control , who controls the adults ? God . The bible is nothing more than a book of morals meant to give those who have nothing to live for a reason to live . Why spend your life thanking someone for creating you , created you to worship him , when you can just live . Who cares who or what we came from , live in the present , think about the future .
However , it is true that creationists ( not necessary to capitalize the word since it is not a proper noun ) , for the most part believe that evolutionists can not be Christian . If you point out an evolutionary biologist that is a Christian , the answer is almost always that he is a true Christian .

When an animal stays with its parent , it has the distinct advantage of being able to copy its parents behaviour . When this happens the animal for the first time doesnt need all the information and tools to survive in its genes . It can learn from its parent . Now for an animal to learn from its parent it needs not to be scared . It needs to be able to trust and vice versa for the parent ... So the offspring that stay with their parent longer learn more , survive better , have more offspring . Now an inevitable consequence of learning from the parent is that the offspring will live with the parent for longer and longer , until at some point the offspring outlive their parent ... Hence the birth of religion , appease themselves .
`` Since the discovery of DNA 's double helical structure more than a half century ago , scientists have focused much of their attention on understanding the 2 percent of the genome that is made up of classic genes , which code for the production of proteins . However , the instructions for turning these genes on or off are generally not in the genes themselves . Rather , they are buried in the 98 percent of the genome that was once cast aside as little more than genetic `` junk . ''

In point of fact , the low birth rate in most of Europe is not due to the availablity of abortion , but to good sex education and the ready availablity of effective contraception to everyone who needs it . See this study , for instance : http : //www.advocatesforyouth.org/PUB ... heet/fsest.htm People have small families because they want small families . In point of fact , the abortion rate in Europe is generally much lower than the rate in the US , due , again , to education and contraception .

I can understand the argument that gun laws may infringe on some individual freedom , but I don`t really understand what the constitution has to do with it . Sure , its much harder to make a change in the constitution , but this doesn`t really affect wether the change should be done or not .
`` The authors claim their book is being rejected on political grounds , '' Koss said . `` But these are criticisms of content and quality . ''
The only thing that has changed is the population ratio , assumably by *natural selection* . Natural selection is not proof of evolution by any means .
is that for you to use these primate fossils as any actual evidence at all that a REAL chain of lineage from those ancient primates to modern man exists is impossible to prove .
Now you are making assumptions . I said God did not tell them the different categories of animals , I did not say that God deliberately kept information from them .
It 's easy to come up with scenarios where you think a gun is the only escape , but then there are plenty of alternatives where guns take lives unnecessarily , be they because children get hold of them , or nutcases , or someone who 's just had a bad day . The advantage of being confronted by a knife wielding maniac ( as opposed to a gun wielding maniac ) is that he/she has to come within arm 's reach . Smiley
The title of the thread gives a false impression by stating that a Christian Pastor believes that bigotry blocked Gay Marriage . Had the title said , pro-gay pastor believes bigotry blocked gay marriage , his position would have appeared as obvious as his views are .

Would depend on how sucessful they thought the handing in was , but do n't you have to register for a leicence ? So all legal owners are know already and can be checked off against the guns they have handed in , I would imagine that there must be departments of the police who deal with tracking black market unregisted guns so these could be cracked down opon .
Ca n't choicers stop insulting the intelligence and capabilities of the people of the country and let them view the evidence and decide for themselves whether abortion harms women 's health , and if it does , whether it ought to be permitted ?
Why did gay marriage get this special treatment ?
Not historical documents but mythology . Genesis is n't historical . To believe that it is takes a certain intentional ignorance of the universe .

The Daily Beacon There 's absolutely no way in hell this could be legal in any sense . That California school got ***** slapped for expelling a student who had a gun off campus , beyond the jurisdictional reach of the school . So how can this school believe they can get away with such an insane policy ?
science and biology has never been my forte , i 'm more of a history and literature person . i believe evolution because it is accepted as fact within scientific circles and there is overwhelming evidence supporting it . you might criticize me for believing evolution happened simply because scientists say it did , but alas , thats the reason why . anyway ... whenever i tell someone that i believe in evolution , they always tell me that if evolution were really true , there would be half-human , half-ape people walking around . i know that this is a ridiculous comeback and there is obviously a scientific explanation why there are not , so i was wondering if someone could let me know the reason why . next time i get told something like that , i want to be able to explain myself . thanks
If were to ever get married , I think it would be relatively small ( 50 to 100 people max )
EDIT : I reread , and it seems you are correct . Creationism isnt a theory at all ! On one of my most generous days , I might call it a set of poor hypotheses . It really should be classified as a myth While it is true that science and religion are not generally compatible , because science is based on evidence supporting a hypothesis , which will eventually become a theory after significant support , and a law after virtually proven true ( but never actually proven ) , while religion is a series of stories to try to explain the universe in the simplest way possible ( god did it ) . Science is meant to expand and change over time until the theory of everything is reached . Religion assumes they already have that theory ( god did it ) . Evolution is no mo0re anti-religion than science itself , except that the conflict manifests itself here .
Crime has been dropping nationwide in recent years . Whoopdee do . There are some interesting statistics at http : //www.ncpa.org/pub/st/st176/s176c.html For example : Face it . Gun control is nonsensical . NOBODY has EVER managed to show any benifit from it . At best , it has no effect on crime and at worst it increases it .

1 ) I would consider a transitional fossil one which contains parts from both the upper and lower class evolutionary forms it links . However , it must contain many of these , and I imagine a few would have `` melded '' during the process .

Can you please provide a cite in the Constitution that supports the notion that a Supreme Court Justice nominee has the power to declare that any case is `` settled law '' and the subsequent power to make it so ? I did n't think so .
No Electrolyte , science lies ! here is the undisputed truth : Noah and his three sons traveled the globe , collected two representatives of each species ( or seven of each clean species depending on the chapter ) . They crammed these critters in a sea worthy vessel made exclusively of gopher wood . The gopher wood was structurally sound enough to support the weight of said critters . The ark floated about like a cork for 40 days , etc whereupon the cargo was released to repopulate the world to present population levels . Meanwhile , there must have been provisions on the Ark for marine animals and fish as the rainwater would have undoubtedly altered the water pH and saline content . Also not mentioned is the fact that Noah and sons must have collected seeds from every PLANT on earth because I am personally not aware of many plant types that can survive completely submerged for 40 days . So you see , it is much harder to believe in a fossil record and sediment deposit stratigraphy , than in a giant boat crammed to the gills full of elephants , octopus , and cacti . I hope I cleared this up for everyone . We have found fossils , but they are all fake . We have not found an ark .but it is real .
I 've been thinking this over and I 've come to the conclusion that ballistic `` fingerprinting '' is the stupidest thing I have ever heard . As a crime fighting tool and especially a prosecutorial tool , it 's worth would be questionable and actually extremely damaging . The characteristics recorded ; land and grooves ( rifling ) on the projectile , breech face marks , firing pin indent and extractor marks on the spent cartridge case , could all be corrupted with the expenditure of about 20 minutes of easy work with a small file and/or a new barrel . For some of the more popular handguns , we 're talking $ 20 for a new barrel . Imagine the enterprising criminal with an extra $ 200.00 in his pocket . He could buy replacement barrels for a few of the more popular handguns and have a lucrative swapping out service . He trades out the first barrel and places the one now `` in hand '' in the next gun . No barrels need to be destroyed , all that needs to be done to defeat the system is have discrepancies between original manufacturer 's supplied projectile on record for a certain serial number gun and the crime scene recovered projectile . `` Lieutenant , this bullet the coroner recovered from Virgil 's head goes with serial number xw34t67 . The gun we found under Harry 's mattress , which we can prove killed Virgil , is number jy57p19 . What good does that do us ? '' Realistically , at that point would any further detective manhours be expended trying to figure out how this happened ? The barrels were swapped , any evidence as far as ballistic `` fingerprinting '' is concerned , is corrupted . Move on . . . How about the questions raised for the prosecution if say Harry does go to trial for shooting Virgil with only two marks matching out of four ? Let 's see , was the ejector swapped out too ? Maybe it 's reloaded ammo , it 's got three ejector marks on it , which firing was incidental to the criminal act ? Another important question ; would such a partial , 2 out of 4 or otherwise inconclusive match , ( which probably would not be offered as evidence or even admissible in court ) , be accepted as probable cause for a search or an arrest warrant ? The next , even more important question is : If the bullets ( original , supplied by manufacturer and the recovered crime scene bullet ) do n't match , does n't that open a Pandora 's Box of claims of `` I 'm being framed ! '' ? ? ? The defendant could claim that it was the police , not him , that swapped barrels . Harry says , '' the cops got a sample bullet from my gun and the bullet that done killed Virgil do n't match ! They put a different barrel in my gun that matches the bullet they said was in Virgil 's noggin '' The state would be providing four pieces of potentially ironclad exculpatory evidence for the defendant ! ( again , land and grooves on the projectile and breech face marks , firing pin indent and extractor marks on the spent cartridge case ) The defense will of course enter into evidence a STATE SEALED document attesting that the following data represents the official -- exclude all others -- `` ballistic fingerprint '' for Harry 's gun , S/N-jy57p19 . The problem for the authorities is , while they can prove that Harry 's gun killed Virgil , ( using standard forensic ballistics ) that fact does not matter anymore because the crime scene bullet , the one in Virgil 's noggin , matches a different gun , not placed in evidence by the prosecution and nowhere to be found . . . This would create a new level to the prosecutor 's burden of proof , now he has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that THIS defendant also swapped the barrel and corrupted other `` fingerprints '' for his weapon in addition to actually firing the weapon that killed the victim . I think that more times than not , this will be an impossible additional hurdle to jump and the outcome of that will be allot of criminals will go free . This `` new '' science of ballistic `` fingerprinting '' would in essence destroy the well established and deserved good reputation of forensic ballistics . I think this proposal will work directly against law enforcement and in the end , help criminals . Debate questions : Does this ballistic fingerprint proposal , with all the inherent questions it raises , realistically help or hurt the police and prosecutors ? Does it increase or lessen the hours needed to solidify a case ? Can anyone prove to me that criminals will not go free using a corrupted ballistic `` fingerprint '' as their legal leverage ?
If only McCain were anywhere near his equal , it might be a contest .
If the christianists are dead set against we gay people getting married then I say lets let them keep marriage . Lets go on the attack and attempt to destroy christainist hetero marriages .

Your arguing apples and oranges . There are laws already on the books , prior to the unfunded mandate statute , that prohibit discrimination in employment . Gays partners have no legal status today , so the granting of legal status to them will result in increased expenditures by business .
The idea of abortion as population control is absurd , especially forced abortions as someone mentioned a few posts ago . Anyone who has read a biology book knows the world has methods of population control on its own , we do n't need to be doing stuff like that ourselves . This stat sounds more than a bit inflated . Seeing as it comes from a website called `` women 's issues '' it is probably not all that credible .

Good , we both agree then that the issue of legality concerning elective abortions is a little more complex than just the simple matter of a persons right to make a `` choice . ''

My point is that - the lizard was designed to survive in a neighborhood where eating leaves , was its best chance of survival .
In a given environment ( e.g . a very cold region ) , some ( e.g . the long-haired dogs ) will be more likely to survive , and so pass on their information , than others . Natural selection can favour some sets of information above others , and can eliminate some of the existing information in the population , but it ca n't create any new information .

South Dakota 's Legislature : Human Life Begins at Conception Susan Jones , CNSNews.com Friday , Feb. 27 , 2004 The South Dakota House on Thursday joined the state Senate in passing a bill that says human life begins at conception  something that would outlaw all abortions in South Dakota , except in cases where the mother 's health or life were endangered . Pro-abortion groups called the bill `` a direct assault on South Dakotans ' rights , '' and pro-life advocates see it as a way of directly challenging the Supreme Court 's 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling that legalized abortion . The bill 's main sponsor , Republican state Rep. Matt McCaulley , called it the `` strongest , cleanest pro-life legislation '' passed by a state legislature since 1973 . Equal Protection He and other supporters say unborn babies deserve equal protection under the 14th Amendment , and they say the state is within its rights to expand the definition of `` persons '' to include unborn babies . `` If this is the case that goes to the Supreme Court to get them to overturn Roe versus Wade , so be it , '' a wire report quoted McCaulley as saying . South Dakota 's pro-life Republican Gov . Mike Rounds has not yet said whether he would sign the bill . He has until March 12 to make up his mind . The bill makes it a crime to perform abortions . The penalties for doing so include up to five years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine , unless a mother 's life is in danger . The bill does not include exceptions for rape or incest . McCaulley estimated that about 800 abortions are performed every year in South Dakota . 'Be Very Worried ' Every American who `` values a woman 's right to choose '' should be worried , said Kate Michelman , president of NARAL Pro-Choice America , in a press release . Michelman said the bill , if upheld by the courts , could endanger the health of women , send doctors to prison for `` doing what is in the best medical interests of their patients , '' and insert government into personal decisions to the point where some widely used forms of birth control might be banned . `` The anti-choice movement has not been shy about its two-pronged strategy for overturning Roe v. Wade , '' Michelman said . She described the strategy as passing bills like the one in South Dakota , then forcing them into the court system and `` hoping that George Bush has the opportunity to put new justices on the Supreme Court who will take the opportunity that these bills provide them to take away reproductive freedom . '' NARAL Pro-Choice America describes itself as the `` leading national advocate of personal privacy and a woman 's right to choose . ''

Actually , the whole basis for modern science depends on the assumption that the universe was made by a rational creator . Dr Stanley Jaki has documented how the scientific method was still-born in all cultures apart from the Judeo-Christian culture in Europe ( Science and Creation ( Edinburgh and London : Scottish Academic Press , 1974 ) ) . An orderly universe makes perfect sense if it was made by an orderly Creator . But if there is no creator , or if Zeus and his gang were in charge , why should there be any order at all ? Loren Eiseley stated ( Loren Eiseley : Darwin 's Century : Evolution and the Men who Discovered It , Doubleday , Anchor , New York ( 1961 ) :

It is equally unclear that I have any moral right to expel an innocent person from my property when I know that doing so will result in his death .
The reason his sentiments confirm the worst fears of creationists is n't because Lewontin alone has those sentiments , it 's because creationists can clearly see those sentiments in the NY Times editorial board , CNN , ABC , Dan Rather , Handgun Control , The Sierra Club - the list is almost endless . Miller continues ;

The modern evolutionary synthesis ( often referred to simply as the new synthesis , the modern synthesis , the evolutionary synthesis , neo-Darwinian synthesis or neo-Darwinism ) , generally denotes the integration of Charles Darwin 's theory of the evolution of species by natural selection , Gregor Mendel 's theory of genetics as the basis for biological inheritance , random genetic mutation as the source of variation , and mathematical population genetics . Major figures in the development of the modern synthesis include Thomas Hunt Morgan , R. A. Fisher , Theodosius Dobzhansky , J.B.S . Haldane , Sewall Wright , Julian Huxley , Ernst Mayr , Bernhard Rensch , George Gaylord Simpson , and G. Ledyard Stebbins . Essentially , the modern synthesis introduced the connection between two important discoveries : the units of evolution ( genes ) and the mechanism of evolution ( selection ) . It also represents a unification of several branches of biology that previously had little in common , particularly genetics , cytology , systematics , botany , and paleontology .
Your notion of `` proper '' behavior comes from a book written 2,000 years ago by ignorant people . You only perpetuate their ignorance .
Have you ever explored micro-biology . It is the most amazing universe you 'd ever want to explore . It makes the macro-biology world look like lego blocks . If you 've ever looked up at the stars and stood in amazement , that 's childs play . Just a bunch of macro-scopic hyper-symmetric globules of matter interacting according to almost perfect text-book formulas . In the micro-biology world , we have almost no understanding of the complexities of interaction.. We have ZERO formulas that can predict appropriate interaction ( though we spend hundreds of billions of dollars trying 'guesswork ' in medical labs ) . micro-biology is the computer-programming world of individual atoms . The number of combinations of atomic interaction is mind-numbing - yet micro-biology has obviously harnessed certain useful patterns . Discovering DNA was like discovering that we can store programming code on electrical tape . That 's a great discovery , but that is a far cry from learning to create software artificial intelligence ( another area we 're probably 100 years away from ) . Defining 'life begins at conception ' is like saying that an airplane becomes an airplane when then contract is signed for a work-order . It 's a meaningless point in time relative to the MILLIONS of complex interactions that are necessary for an airplanes life-cycle . Conception is the formation of a zygote , two gametes that are wonderfully complex machines that come in contact in a VERY small subset of life forms ( most life-forms do not use sex-discrimination as a method of reproduction ) . If you looked at primitive single-celled micro-biology , you 'd be hard pressed to even begin to quantify it 's beauty and complexity . The fact that a subset of micro-biology happens to congregate into multi-cellular organisms for 'communal living ' has both advantages and disadvantages ( microbes will survive global warming , will we ? ) . With multi-cellular life , there 's sex and sexless reproduction ... Again , the conception ( from a mechanical perspective ) is all but meaningless . So to give significance to conception reveals several things about the promoter : 1 ) There is little appreciation , or at least little awareness of the scope of complexities ( i.e . how primitive humans and our brains are compared to the mechanics of our micro-biological constituents ) 2 ) There is little appreciation , or at least little awareness of the insignificance of conception as a process ( it merely promotes genetic diversity without the aid of external agents like viruses ) 3 ) There is likely an overt indoctrination of a spiritual element to conception/birth - cognitive dissidence is common where a decision that you 've made earlier in your life ( i.e . that the church is a good source of wisdom ) preempts future decisions , even in the face of new logical evidence . It follows that 'life ' as is primitively portrayed in the `` pro-life '' , `` pro-abortion '' debate neglects the fact that we are not individuals , but a collective of billions of life-forms . Many of which dedicate their brief life to specific mechanical functions ( formation of skin , hair , red-blood-cells , gametes , etc ) . Cells regularly 'commit suicide ' for the good of the collective ( they are programmed to do so ) . Thus the loss of a cell 's life is precious , to be honored , and for the purposes of our discussion , to be taken in context . A zygote is nothing more than a fraction of a second after a mechanical process of two would-be-dead gametes . There is no `` injection-of-a-soul '' . In Rush 's paradigm , I challenge you to know otherwise . There is no measureable change in energy/mass or even appearance . Nothing more than can be derived by watching individual molecular structures interacting with their otherwise boring chemical surroundings . A 'soul ' , as many would promote , must either be intrinsically present before the zygote or be non-existent . There is no measureable guidance ( no random operation - pure machine execution of pre-defined code sequences ) . And , FYI , the DNA is only a SMALL part of the code-sequencing . Each decade we discover new subtle aspects about micro-biology which humbles us in our lack of knowledge . The micro-biology-machine is glorious in it 's complexity . A 'soul ' as one can best be known could exist in the ancestry of micro-biology . The fore-bearers , a plausible architect . And in that vein , every cell that undergoes mitosis ( or meiosis in the formation of gametes ) is a subdivision of the ancestrial architecture . Not the formation of new 'life ' . Nothing changes from the moment prio to and there-after - conception . It is not important for this discussion to elaborate on the origins one way or another . My intent is to express the complete lack of appreciation for what is probably the most important thing humans will ever have the privledge of conceiving . That we truely are insignificant compared to this vast existence.. That we are happily living at the top of the food-chain and chain of understanding ( at least so far as we know there are no other being in our area with greater prowess ) . That we should be humble and respect 'life ' ( which hopefully I 've conveyed as greater than humanity by many orders of magnitude ) . That death is an intricate part of life.. That life MUST commit suicide for the benifit of the many in order for the aggregate to survive.. That given the power to decide who/what lives and dies is not unique to us - even the earliest mobile micro-biology wielded this power . That we must strive to only kill in balance and for the greater good . And from that greater good , abortion becomes a mechanical act with significance . Is the world a better place for the abortion ? Will life flourish because we 've chosen to exclude one lineage of genetic diversity from prospering ? I suggest that abortion can be part of the greater-good in many circumstances . To the same extent that not every sperm or egg is properly utilized.. The fact that some have unintentially become fertilized is irrelevant - to the same extent that a mechanical process is initiated unintentially ( like accidentally hitting the wrong button on the keyboard - you quickly hit the escape function to `` regain control '' ) . If the parents are not ready to organize their lives around producing the best possible children , then they are not fullfilling their duty as macro-scopic being . Or at least not fullfilling their potential and therefore arguably of little use to the collective . When you become parents , YOUR potential for growth is over.. That is , unless you adhere to the classical barefoot and pregnant mother , lifestyle , and you are the 'provider ' . Whatever worth you provide to the world is , in all probability , limited to your contribution as a parent . You are probably not going to become president , etc , and thus have direct political impact on world affairs . But you can choose to raise a child with patience , discipline , intellect , respect and inspiration . And thereby produce a well balanced human that maintains hope for the future of our species . Or you can rush into parenthood , with a disconnected/mal-adjusted family , producing a depressed/ suicidal/introverted offspring . Which , on average , will 'get by ' if not 'devolving ' due to lack of survival-based-genetic-cleansing that our ancestors underwent . I have personally gone through more than one abortion . But they were days after the incident - and as I promote above , the 'escape button ' . Soulfully irrelevant . Mechanically boring . The philosophical aspects are best left to the poets , who 've got nothing better to do with their lives , apparently . I have a beautiful daughter right now for whom I love with my every breath ; but I have no remorse over the false-starts of my past . And I argue , that if you think about it , neither should you .
The researchers suspect this cellular GPS system plays roles other than wound healing . The primary cilia could serve as a fail-safe device against uncontrolled cell movement , says Christensen . Without chemical stimulation , the primary cilia would restrain cell migration , preventing the dangerous displacement of cells that is associated with invasive cancers and fibrosis , the scientists explain . On the other hand , defective primary cilia might fail to provide correct directional instructions during cell differentiation . This failure could be another link connecting primary cilia to severe developmental disorders , the researchers suggest . Protruding through the cell membrane , primary cilia occur on almost every non-dividing cell in the body . Once written off as a vestigial organelle discarded in the evolutionary dust , primary cilia in the last decade have risen to prominence as a vital cellular sensor at the root of a wide range of health disorders , from polycystic kidney disease to cancer to left-right anatomical abnormalities .
And it 's so bleedin ' unnecessary , too ! Why not just create the universe as it is ? And just let the light take it 's sweet time to get here ? Imagine what proof for creationism that would be : we can only see stars out to 6000 light years or so ; looking at old star charts we realize that people 1000 years ago could only see stars out to 5000 light years ; and as time goes by additional stars appear in the sky as the light from them finally reaches us . If God did create the universe only 6000 years ago , the fact that we can see the entire universe now can only count as a deliberate , I will repeat , a deliberate , oh how I love that word , DELIBERATE deception on the part of the creator .
How strange . It seems that Habbit 's definition of the word definition is meaningless . [ cutting the useless part , do n't want to waste server space ]

Guess I did n't read the following verses ( mainly because they are under another heading ) - I just looked for places with `` ripped up '' after I saw it in the previous part - my bad on this one , but the others still stand .
The Christian theistic worldview can account for the laws of logic by stating that they come from God . God is transcendent ; that is , He is beyond the material universe being its creator . God has originated the laws of logic because they are a reflection of His nature . Therefore , the laws of logic are absolute . The are absolute because there is an absolute God . The atheistic worldview can not account for the laws of logic/absolutes , and must borrow from the Christian worldview in order to rationally argue .

The age of 18 is an arbitrary designation .
The zygote is the cell formed when the sperm fertilises the egg . The zygote has no brain , it has no conciousness . You have two tables , one with a small test tube which you know holds a microscopically small living zygote , and another table with a live baby . You are told that one of them will be destroyed and you have just two seconds to decide which , or both will be destroyed . Without a seconds thought I would immediately point in the direction of the zygote , and save the life of the baby . Extreme pro-lifers on the otherhand would probably end up killing the baby or both via indecision and inability to make a choice in just 2 seconds . That 's the morality of pro-life for you : the inability to realise that the chemical reactions that happen when a sperm meets an egg do not define a human person . Am I wrong ? I do n't believe so . The sperm meeting the egg is a really random point to decide the emergance of a human person . Why pick that point specifically ?
God is not a racist .

Of course it is . It is just one more cog in the wheel of our moral and social decline that will lead to our complete destruction as a rational and civilized Society . And the radical gay agenda has proven they have the same ethics as Al-Queda and practices a scorched Earth Policy too . You will gladly tear down our Democracy in order to gain the undeserved rights you demand for yourselves . You see nothing wrong with forcing the majority of the population to submit to the immoral will of a tiny minority when all of the human and civil rights protections have already been afforded you . But that is not enough for you . You must force your unnatural lifestyles in our faces and then insist we are bigots for not enjoying or just accepting the perversions you see as natural , normal and right . Just because you ca n't see , or refuse to see the long term negative effects of your unnatural lifestyle being imposed on the larger society , it does n't for one minute mean they are n't real and evident in their destructive consequences .
I am aware of that . I am just having trouble reconciling the idea of removing a fundamental right based on a misdemeanor conviction and was wondering if there is similar precedent elsewhere .

AUBURN , Wash. - Two women and a man were seriously injured when gunfire broke out early Saturday in Auburn , and three suspects were arrested later after a short police chase . Officers and medics responded to the scene , in the 1600 block of 33rd Street SE in Auburn , at about 1 a.m. after receiving a 911 call about shots fired in the area . As police swooped in , they spotted two vehicles fleeing the scene with their lights out . ... . The shooting victims - two women and one man in their late teens or early 20s - are being treated at Auburn General Hospital and Harborview Medical Center . All have serious injuries . The identities of the victims and suspects were not immediately released . A report from Valley Regional Fire Authority said one of the gunshot victims may be pregnant . The shooting incident remains under investigation . No motive has yet been established .
So even though this man is in no way an anti-evolutionist , even he had to admit that what had been not only assumed to be true about the coelacanth , but had been widely reported as a discovery which was supported by documented fossil evidence , was a complete myth . Which I believe and assert can be said for all of the so called evidence which exists for the pseudo science of evolution .
Actually , YES I HAVE ! Not recently , but every time a cop has ever told me to sign a ticket he has made it clear that signing it is n't an admission of guilt , just an acknowledgment of receiving it .

The fear on the street is palpable . Ever since the election of Barack Obama as President of these United States in November 2008 , coupled with the election of a democrat party majority in both the U.S. House and Senate , concern for the United States and personal safety has ignited like a fire in dry grass . < snip > What is odd about this new fear is that it is not coming from the average citizen gun owner out there , but it is coming from what to me is an almost shocking source : street cops . Street cops and SWAT cops that I know from various agencies  rural , suburban and metro  in my area are scared . Cops that before November 2008 never gave much thought ( that I knew of anyway ) to politics or more importantly to gun rights . For the most part , these are the guys that didnt generally have any interest in shooting or gun ownership beyond keeping track of where their duty gun is , and a few of them didnt even do that so well . The guys I am talking about now are some of the same guys who used to not even carry off duty on a regular basis- but not anymore . They dont scare easily , defenders of the Constitution of this State and the United States ( as our oath of office reads ) , have been buying ARs , survival gear , and all the ammo they can lay their hands on . All of them ( or I should say us ) have been discussing and have been acquiring guns to provide a layered perimeter defense . What are we suddenly so afraid of ? Well in our discussions it seems to boil down to four areas ... First , fear of federal government intrusion into our lives . Every time I look at or listen to the news , there is something new and intrusive coming out of the Obama administration and this Congress . New tax schemes , government-run Canadian-style healthcare , a volunteer citizen defense force ( whatever that is , what happened to the National Guard ? ) equipped with funding similar to our military , forced voluntary service after retirement , a lack of a southern border with hordes of illegal and criminal aliens pouring over our border , the swine flu scare as well as government forced closing of thousands of privately held Chrysler and GM dealerships , which will be the final nail in the coffin for these companies and the list goes on and on . But these items in the news are just the tip of the iceberg . We cant see the full impact of these actions yet , but we dont know what was added into the thousand of pages of stimulus package bills in the dead of night yet . I predict however that when the plans contained in the stimulus packages go into effect , a lot of us are going to be surprised if not shocked by what has suddenly and sweepingly changed . What also scares us is the second , well-founded fear that there is an assault weapons ban looming , one that would make the Clinton Ban appear like a look of disdain in comparison . I remember well the 1990s and the Clinton years : the rise of militia groups , the black helicopter rumors and paranoia , all of which was motivated by the Brady Law and the Assault Weapons ban . What if a new ban comes requiring registration or confiscation and turn-in of banned weapons as what happened in Australia ? I foresee much civil disobedience coming down the road . Americans are citizens , and not subjects like the British , Canadians or Australians . They just dont always obey the law blindly and not one officer or citizen that I spoke to said anything like I hope I get to keep this gun for awhile before they are banned ; They are fun to shoot , so I would hate to give it up. It isnt going to happen , so the cop on the street and the soldier on the base needs to think now what he will do if the orders come down . I think you all get what I am saying here . Which leads me to the third fear , that there is a revolution coming , yes , a revolution on the scale of the original American Revolution . You can hear this topic discussed on many of the talk radio shows by even the big name hosts . The possibility of an armed revolution against the U.S. government being discussed , albeit very gingerly and fleetingly and as something to be avoided , which it is . I never heard this mentioned in the 90s . One of my quietest , low profile officer friends brought it up the other day . He said that at some point in the near future , he felt there is going to be an armed revolt if things keep going the way they are . Something has got to give . I was shocked . Yes , I had heard this from some of my more radical cop friends in the past , but to hear it from a guy like this was unprecedented . Now , these guys are not saying this will happen to foment revolution , preach sedition or to even participate . They just want to be ready if it happens , to at least defend their families , because number four on the fear list is general societal chaos . Cops fear for their parents , wives , children or grandchildren more now than ever before . Most cops are encouraging their spouses and loved ones to get concealed carry permits . Not only that , but some of these same cops are buying gun mounts for their personal cars so they can carry an AR in the family ride at the ready all the time . They are also strapping on heavier forms of off-duty hardware . I have other friends that are issued ARs or subguns for tactical team use , who always have their gear with them and are planning on just commandeering these weapons for personal use in defending hearth and home . Final Notes This is pretty heady and maybe even dangerous stuff . Know fully that I am not advocating anything here . I am reflecting to you what I see and hear going on around me , and maybe saying things that havent been said in the open , until now . It is something to think about .
For one to have evolution as their foundation belief , means that one can not be certian of anything ... ..There are no absalutes to build from !

Wow , this shows how hypocritical some people can be . These gun owners are not only disrespecting the Constitution by showing disrespect for a Constitutionally elected president , they also threaten the free speech rights of others . It 's a step backwards . In a civilized democratic society people should be able to freely debate and discuss politics without feeling threatened by someone openly displaying a gun . That `` It is time to water the tree of liberty '' quote is the same quote McVeigh was wearing on his shirt the day he blew up the Federal Building .

Stevens said that bear arms has a military meaning . So was he saying that the right is individual but existed in connection with militia service ? Is this some kind of hybrid model ? Interestingly , scholars who made similar claims in the past got lumped in with those who supported a collective right by the pro gun crowd . But I suppose it sounds good to say that all nine Supreme Court justices supported an individual rights interpretation .
Because you seem to lose sight of that with your whackjob ideas . Case in point `` The manufacturer would have to know where to point LE '' now you have the manufacturer involved in law enforcement . Would you have the big 3 involved in pointing out to LE who last bought their products involving drive bys and vehicular homicide ? You have no clue as to how the whole process works yet you are going to put your oar in and muddy the process . Here 's a small lesson for you . The manufacturers of firearms do n't sell to dealers . They sell to distributors who in turn sell to dealers . You are still lacking any valid proof that the law abiding are the problem .
Sure we are . Creationism vs all the sciences ( including the biological Theory of Evolution ) and reality .

Smoking tobacco is quite unhealthy even without pesticides .
Mark , I must vigorously protest these statements . You have entered into this debate supposedly to demonstrate with logic , reasoning , and measureable evidence that the theory of evolution is the truth . But these statements do not support the theory of evolution . You are merely appealing to the authority of the scientific and academic community , and seeking to intimidate and bash the opposition into silence . This will not sponsor intellectual discussion and debate .
Right now , I might consider it , as I am now a few weeks away from my graduation . Back then , I would not , as I had just begun college ( I was in my sophomore year for my BS - now I 'm about to get my MS ) . However , there is also that other major part of my decision - I never had the intention to become pregnant , and we even took steps to make sure I would n't . That also is a major factor in any of my decisions on it . Another decision that involves my work is that from about my fifth month on ( acording to the doctors I spoke with ) - I would be unable to work - that 's four months , and while right now I am in good standing with my company and they might even allow me to do that , back then I was just starting out , and would be unable to do so . So , I 'd say that at the moment if that were to happen , and that I was paid a stipend ( I know of no place near me that does so ) and then gave the baby up for adoption , my fiance and I would seriously consider the prospect . I know that in the future - in five years or so - we expect to be able to have paid off all our loans , and we will then consider actually having a baby . So in summary - now I would consider it , but back when I had the actual abortion ( 6 years ago or so ) I would not consider it .

A blind faith in a particular religion 's God seems rather different than a decision based upon reasoning
The Killing of George Tiller : A `` Pro-life '' Murder ? `` Pro-life '' as the self-description of the anti-abortion movement has a fundamental flaw at its heart . The moral absolute of `` life '' is not applied consistently , in my view , by the majority of those in this movement . Many in the `` pro-life '' anti-abortion movement seem to me to only be pro-life in the case of abortion -- unlike those who hold an ethic of life across a range of moral issues , not only abortion but also war and the death penalty , This makes `` pro-life '' in regard to abortion not only an inconsistent ethic , but an unstable one . Nothing exposes this fundamental inconsistency and instability in the ethic of life as a description of the anti-abortion movement more than `` pro-life '' murder . ... . Violence has been a part of the anti-abortion movement from the beginning , from the overt violence of the murder of other abortion providers to the covert violence of harassing women trying to get to clinics for reproductive services . Violence is a logical outcome of the extreme self-righteousness of those who claim the `` pro-life '' label as an absolute and yet who do not have an actual , consistent ethic of life such as the views held by pacifists . Dr. Charles Kimball , a Baptist minister and professor of religion at Wake Forest University , well explains this logical connection in his book When Religion Becomes Evil . According to Kimball , two warning signs that indicate a religious viewpoint is becoming evil are `` absolute truth claims '' and `` the end justifies any means . '' Violence , in Kimball 's view , is an evil .
I would argue that there would be a decrease in crime , for certain .
I 'd love to know the exact questions asked . -Wez
There are some objections that I have to that interpretation . 1 ) It does not examine the meaning of the term `` bear arms '' at the time of the writing of the Constitution . 2 ) In most second amendment cases the courts have not agreed with the above interpretation . 3 ) The American Bar Association rejects such an interpretation . `` Since today 's 'well regulated militia ' does not use privately owned firearms , courts since Miller have unanimously held that regulation of such guns does not offend the Second Amendment ... As lawyers , as representatives of the legal profession , and as recognized experts on the meaning of the Constitution and our system of justice , we share a responsibility to the public and lawmakers to 'say what the law is . ' '' http : //www.abanet.org/gunviol/secondamend.html 4 ) Historians H. Richard Uviller and William G. Merkel explain the language of the second amendment this way- `` It does not say : 'a well-regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state , and the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed ' ... .it was n't written that way . Rather , in the first part , the verbal vehicle elected for the verb 'to be ' is a participle , yielding a phrase known to grammarians as an 'ablative absolute construction . ' This construction characterizes a phrase modifying the substance of the main clause as an adjective would modify a noun , often expressing the condition or circumstances of the assertion of the main clause . It creates an indissoluble link between the two parts of the sentence , and grammatically subjects the right to arms to the rule of the militia modifier . As a simple matter of grammar , the participial modifier is essential for the declarative clause to occur . Had the two statements- regarding the importance of a militia and the right to arms- not been joined in this manner , it might have been possible to argue that even if the first declaration ceases to be true , the second is undiminished . And it seems significant that the Framers chose the structure they did . ''

Huh ? How was allowing you to make your own decisions in your own personal life interferance by the goverment ? That 's like saying a parent allowing a child to do what they wish intefering in their personal lives . How are they interferring when they are letting them do what they wish ? You 're not making any sense at all . Sadly yes . People should be able to make their own decisions without a nanny state , but that 's not going to change as the Gop holds the federal govermment . Beyond the fact that government said that you can have a abortion , they were not interferring with your decisions . A goverment that actively promotes freedoms and rights is not interfering with the lives as a govermment that actively restricts rights and monitors for such violations in the personal lives of its citizens .
Thiest : I believe in God ? What is God as best defined by you ? Describe the nature of God . What is it that you believe in ?
For the pro-life community , the issue comes down to the fact that every human being has intrinsic value and worth , and their life is valuable for its own sake
As an adoptive parent of 3 with decent knowledge of how 'the system ' works , it 's these annoying BS answers that tick me off . Perpetuating ignorance if not outright deciet to justify a decision to abort .
Have ago at believing the irrational , `` the wisdom of the world is completley oppisite to the wisdom of god '' , Its the wisdom of the world that says only the strong survive , but the wisdom of GOD says `` to seek your life you will lose it but to lose it for my sake you will find it !

I tell you now , a fetus is not morally a person to me . There , you are refuted .

No it can not exist without being subject to God 's Will . The only way the hypotehtical Rock could exist would be if God would deem to give the rock Free Will and then deem to honor the rock 's Free Will as God honors Free Will -- the vast majority of the time -- within people . This hypothetical is rather pedistrian .
Sticking a pair of scisors in the back of a full-grown , half born , fetus ' head , with the doctor holding in his hands a fetus about to be born , is not just wrong in a Christian belief . YOu 're sick if you support it .

States which do n't allow people to carry concealed weapons or have strict concealed carry laws have experienced a bigger drop in violent crime . `` Between 1992 through 1998 ( the last six years for which data exists ) , the violent crime rate in the strict and no-issue states fell 30 % while the violent crime rate for states that liberalized carry laws prior to 1992 dropped half as much  by 15 % . Nationally , the violent crime rate fell 25 % . '' http : //www.bradycampaign.org/facts/r ... /conctruth.asp

I would n't say one ca n't be a Christian if they support abortion but I find it really hard to understand how one justifies or rectifies it with the Bible or their faith . Ultimately their are responsible to God for what they believe and how they advise others on what to do in a situation based on that belief . I know that one of the things God HATES and there are n't many things mentioned in the bible that He hates , one of the things is the shedding of innocent blood . If God HATES such a thing then I certainly do not want to support it . I do n't know what could be more innocent than an unborn child . I did a bit of research on abortion & amp ; the bible a few years ago , here is a collection of what I found - Abortion & amp ; The Bible
20 billion years ago there was a Big Bang [ what exploded : since the year 2006 , scientists have claimed that nothing exploded into the universe !
All your posts are like this . Are you on crack ?
The anti-abortionists claim that would be killing a human life to save one .
Wells also shows how most of the other `` evidence '' for evolution -- including textbook `` icons '' such as Peppered Moths , Darwin 's Finches , Haeckel 's Embryos , and the Tree of Life -- has been exaggerated , distorted . . . or even faked .

Reason can not be applied to it . Furthermore , since evolution relies on reason , faith can not be applied to it .

Robbie , You are unbelievable . No one is sitting here saying that the fetus inside the whomb are unhappy people . Women get abortions for a ton of reasons . I am Irish Catholic and even I am not such a freak about a womens right to chose . You sound like Hitler .
I too find it amusing to read about Canada 's nightmare socialist healthcare system . This past weekend I went to the hospital after injuring myself in a race . From the door to triage : 2 minutes . Triage to admission : 10 minutes . Examined , treated , and discharged within 30 minutes . Discussion of payment : 0 . Never in my life have I had difficulty in seeing any doctor I wanted to , nor have my friends or family members . All this for far less expenditure per gdp than the US .
BWWWWAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ! Are you trying to be deceptive or is it that you really did n't understand what you read ? It 's really pretty simple . The first link does not suggest that man arose in China . It is a discussion of a primate fossil . While humans are primates , all primates are not necessarily humans . The article discusses a primate fossil , the oldest yet discovered . It does not claim that mankind arose in China .

A zygote is just as viable as a human being as a born baby .
I think his point is paulie , that if evolution is actually as evo defines it , as changes made by way of random mutations , then why does n't life reflect those random mutations ? For example , why have n't a large number of lower animals who live their lives being hunted by carnivores adapted eyes in the back of their heads as a needed early warning system to see their stalkers coming from behind them ? Especially in times of drought and famine when food is scarce ? The environmental pressure exists at those times to justify such a change , yet from fish to birds to reptiles to mammals to even insects , most every creature in creation has 2 eyes , 1 mouth , 2 ears , ( if they even have ears since some animals use vibration sensors to locate the movement of prey and predator . ) It makes sense that Eagles , Hawks and Falcons have only 2 eyes since they are apex predators which rule their skies . But they regularly swoop down on smaller birds and pluck them out of the sky for food for their young . So why have n't smaller birds found the need to evolve eyes in the back of their heads ?
Based on threads I 've been reading here , there is a real tendency among some of the pro-choicers to portray pregnancy as a horrible thing that cause women to suffer -- that it is somthing bad or undesirable . - How could the opportunity to bring a life into the world , a wonderful miracle , be so awful by default ? Rather than bring into this peripheral thoughts to the question , such as rights and legal issues ( which are discussed at length here already in other threads ) , I 'd love to hear straightforward relelvant answers to this . I am also already aware that pregnancy can sometimes involve complications or that it can at times cause financial constraints . But I am mainly interested in seeing why there is a default tendency in pro-choice arguments to argue from the standpoint of pregnancy being a bad thing . Any thoughts ?
Thought you needed some kind of documentation before you get them ? Are they really completely unregistered , documented or anything then or is this a state by state thing ? As for criminals , if owning a gun instantly marked you out as a criminal then some would reconsider as for the rest , some incentive to hand them over and a stiff punishment if they do not . Press I do not think would be a problem , pro-gun extremists always seem worse than anti-gun ones as far as the media is concerend ( worst you can say about the antis is that they are living in some dream world and are a little naive , compared to the worst sterotype of red-neck , shotgun totin ' gun nut is not really a comparison ) . More importantly you would n't instigate the gun ban unless a significant majority were in favour in which case the press ( national at least ) would be more likely to be on your side . Attempting a gun ban on a country that does n't want it on the whole is undemocratic and just asking for trouble anyway-regardless of any moral consideration you are playing right inot the hand sof the pro-gunner 's worst fears of government bullying .
Even if some stupid Christians subscribe to the god of the gaps nonsense it would be the pot calling the kettle black . There is not one single peer reviewed piece of evidence proving a link between birds and dinosaurs , fish to amphibians , a rational explanation of what caused the big bang etc . The comeback is that science just has n't found the proof yet . Or the favorite we have no proof because it happened long ago and far away .
Why is only the father punished ? Having consensual sex is just that - consensual on the part of both people . If it is n't consensual , rape laws already cover it and if it is consensual and a pregnancy occurs , why punish only one of the consenting individuals ?
you remind me of people in the 1969 thinking moon colonies were a few years away
wow , thats quite an argument .
Wo n't work . `` danger to the mother 's life '' has to cover allowing an abortion if there is a significant risk of psychological damage which might lead to suicide . Any doctor , especially in a country like yours with a runaway litigation culture , faced with `` I will kill myself and the baby if you do n't abort '' will decide there is a significant risk ( to his wallet mainly ) . It is for this reason that `` convenience abortions '' are technically illegal here in the UK , but they occur anyway .
The end result is that the city approved the purchase of 46 Smith & amp ; Wesson M & amp ; P 15 rifles , the same as those used by the city 's SWAT unit .

You 'd have to show me their announcements of bias and conspiratorial intent , before I 'd agree that they are as bad as you imply , but I have no question that they admit the possibility of extrapolation of ID for religious purposes far more than atheists admit the possibility of extrapolation of evolution for atheistic purposes . Why ? Because Christians have guidelines about lying .

I get tired of hearing about abortion being a 'woman 's right ' and that any one that defends pro-life ideals are specifically seeking out to diminish the rights of women . There are two lives at stake here , which rarely gets mentioned by people who believe in 'pro-choice ' . There is no way to argue out of the fact that at 8 weeks ( and remember that pregnancy is calculated in weeks which begins at the start of the last menstrual period , so the embryo has only been established and growing for 6 weeks ) the embryo looks human , has developed reflexes and functioning brain tissue , and very importantly has a fully operational circulatory system , i.e . it 's heart is beating . Now people can argue how aware the embryo is at 6 , 7 , 8 , or 20 weeks or how much pain they can feel , but with out intervention that baby has a 70 plus percent chance of survival and WILL be a human being someday . Those are FACTS that can not be argued . The goal of people who are pro-life are not fighting to take rights away from women . They are fighting to GAIN rights for unborn children . With so many methods of birth control available today for men and women that are affordable and simple to use to PREVENT pregnancy , I do n't know why women still choose the option of abortion which is painful , expensive and emotional . It shows a major lack of responsibility and maturity on their part .
and 'Peeling is driven by an emotional , philosophical imperative ' -
Care to comment ?
I 've seen some debate over the rate of mutations and it seems difficult on that basis alone for there to be enough beneficial mutations to arise . This makes the chances of passing on any benefit almost impossible .

Yep thats true . There in separate buildings but right next to each other . I see it being about as attractive as a crack house next to a school with a revolving door in front .
`` ... registering honest gun owners does n't stop criminals , and in fact focuses in exactly the opposite direction . It is an allocation of resources that has no chance of achieving its goal , if that goal is the reduction of crime . '' And that in a nutshell puts to rest Calico Slimjim 's puffery on registration .
Hard to argue with that logic . Well thought out I might add .
And here 's something else I do n't get . Evolutionists ' concept of selection basically means `` survival of the fittest . ''
Conclusion Based on the above lines of reason , I assert that reproduction is not an absolute requirement of life : that something could be considered to be alive without it necessarily needing to be able to reproduce .
Originally posted by Patriot I agree , but do you think that if abortion were made illegal , and the death penalty/jail sentance were imposed as a punishment for this crime that `` hundereds and then thousands '' of women would have abortions done ?

Well , I went to school in the backwoods so I was taught evolution for about an hour throughout my high school career . Why ? Because the science teachers knew that self-righteous narrow minded Christians would crucify them . I read up on evolution with 18 years of knowledge on `` Creationism '' , and decided that it did n't conflict with the God that I knew .
As far as your quotes go , I hope that you realise that Feduucia still believes that they are a transitional . He just disagrees on what they are a transitional of .
ID is not biblical creationism
No , that is a false perception .
Of course , according to creationists , this mutation which resulted in two alleles in the human genome where there had previously been one is a reduction in `` information . '' Everyone knows that 2 is less than 1 .

Really ? ? ? You think most people would incorporate the golden rule ? I do n't think so -- I think most people are willing to make a buck off of others ( business ventures ) , land that job they want before someone else gets it , curse someone for cutting them off in traffic , get that parking spot before the guy coming around the corner gets it , or even get in an intentionally insulting dig to someone in a discussion forum such as this .

He found that adaptive genetic mutations arising systematically under these circumstances outnumbered maladaptive and inconsequential mutations to a high degree , statistically speaking .

Banning the ownership of guns in the United States will not cause Beretta or Glock to cease making guns . Guns will be sold illegally in the USA forever . And the criminals will have a distinct advantage in knowing that their target prey ( the honest man ) is not armed .
As a Christian who accepts evolution as fact , I think it is great that Kansas has gone back to teaching actual science instead of religious delusions of the IDers .

There is Nuclear theory , do you claim the atomic bombs never went off in Japan ?

It 's by that definition , rational .

Evolution meets these requirements , and is therefore entirely rational . Anything else ?

Obvious child , I think we 've gathered enough info and opinions to conclusively answer your question . God does n't endorse abortions . In fact , as a rule God commands against murder of all kinds .
I am intrigued to see that both sides have to be black or white . Either the creationist says the Bible is true down to the last detail or the anti-creationists say it is totally false and absolutely nothing as described ever happened . I wish to wave the flag for the middle ground . I do not believe that the Bible is 100 % accurate historically . I do believe that many events ( including the flood ) happened in some form or other and many of these are long-ago racial memories which may well have been enhanced/distorted/spun over the course of millenia . Trying to date the early parts of the Bible is effectively impossible . It is hard enough later on even at the time of the 'slavery ' in Egypt . Much more interesting to try and workout what may have happened .

That evolutionist call on the god of time and chance , The Almighty IT to explain what can not be observed or tested . Little insignificant changes turned fish into amphibians long ago and far far away .
I disagree . Well maybe technically . Let 's look at it this way . Criminals ' access to guns may even go slightly up , because there are SOME criminals who may not want to obtain a handgun illegally . But the access of innocent citizens will go up way more than that of criminals , thus less criminals will want to commit a robbery or something with the fear of the person living there owning a gun . Criminals may forget getting a gun anyway so maybe indirectly , but the major problem is access to guns , not ownership of guns . Access will go up , no one disputes that , but people using them for self-defense goes much higher so that more than makes up for the increase in access for criminals . Make sense ?
plus there are so many other sciences that are lumped with evolution ,
Now , now , Terje ... ever been to Texas ?
How are religious people and atheists alike ? well they both take the bible to literal . Humans evolved from apes you say ? that has NEVER been proven ... again , the basis of science is THEORY and not FACTS

Interesting sidenote to the Elliot case : Gun Shop Held Liable * On January 16 a jury ordered Guns Unlimited , a Virginia Beach , Wa.-based gun shop , to pay $ 100,000 to the family of a teacher who was shot and killed by a student . The teen-ager 's 40-year-old cousin had bought the gun illegally for the boy at the store . Daren Farley was a teacher at the Atlantic Shores Christian School in Virginia Beach when she was fatally short with a 9mm pistol in December 1988 during a rampage by student Nicholas Elliott . Elliott also wounded another teacher with the pistol that had been bought three months earlier at Guns Unlimited . According to Associated Press , the cousin , Curtis Lee Williams , testified he bought the $ 300 gun with money given him by Elliott , then 15 . Williams , who served a 15-month prison term for lying on the federal paperwork involved in the sale , claimed Elliott was with him in the store , told the sales clerk which gun he wanted to get , andcarried the firearm from the store . Tony Sassengill , the sales clerk , said he could not remember Williams or Elliott . He said he knew he could not sell any handgun to a minor and would not have allowed such a transaction as described by Williams . Farley 's family had sought $ 3 million . Randy Singer , the family 's attorney , asked for a new hearing on the issue of damages . Peter Manson Jr. , an attorney representing Guns Unlimited , said the case against the gun store was based entirely on the word of Williams , who was convicted of lying on the sales form , and that there was no way the clerk could have known the gun would be used to commit a crime .

It is commonly claimed by secular scientists that creationism is a science stopper. The contention is that to ascribe anything ( e.g. , the origin of living organisms ) to the direct action of God is to cut off all scientific inquiry . This seems such simple common sense that it has been very persuasive . Nevertheless , it is not difficult to show that the argument is fallacious . A number of general points can be made . First , the argument is based on ignorance of all the different ways in which Christian faith can enter into science and of how fruitful these have been . After all , many of the great scientists of the past were committed Christians and many of those were consciously exploring the implications of their Christian faith for science . Second , whereas the direct action of God may cut off one type of explanation , others will remain and may even be enhanced . To say that God created the different kinds of animals and plants certainly cuts off explanation in terms of evolutionary continuity . However , it leaves wide-open scientific investigation of every other pattern of relationship ( ecological , developmental , etc . ) between these kinds . Scientists have been so indoctrinated in the belief that all patterns can only be explained historically in terms of the happenstances of Darwinian evolution that many wouldnt even know how to look for explanations in other terms . Third , there is abundant documentation of the fact that evolutionary naturalism has often stopped scientific research . To take just one example , the evolutionary assumption that certain organs or features are vestigial has often long delayed the ( fruitful ) research into their functions . More specifically , one can appeal to experience and this is where this essay becomes a personal testimony to the scientific fruitfulness of a commitment to creation . During my undergraduate days when my heretical views became known , my professor ( Otto Lowenstein , Professor of Zoology ) made a point of telling me that no creationist would be allowed to do research in his department ! However , he did allow me to do research . From the pressure that was put on me , I can only assume that it was thought that I could be convinced of the error of my ways . If that was the intention , then it badly backfired . Many a visiting scholar was brought into my laboratory to convince me , from their area of expertise , that evolution was indisputably true . Of course , hardly knowing their field , I never had an answer at the time , but after they had gone I would look up the relevant research and carefully analyze it . I always found that the evolutionist case was much weaker than it had seemed and that alternative creationist interpretations were available which were just as or more convincing . My position was further strengthened by the results of my own research .
We are not evolving , but devolving .

One of the specific ploys I 've seen them use time & amp ; again is to say that natural selection is either a tautology ... I seem to take a different approach to this objection than most people . The principle of NS is so painfully obvious that I have trouble understanding why people have trouble understanding it . For this reason , I can see how it does sometimes come across as tautologous . Two plus two may be four because we 've defined two and four that way , but that does n't make the equation untrue . Likewise , that those genes that help animals be better able to pass on their genes will be passed on more often ( due to whatever specifics ) is true regardless of objection . Whatever works , works . Those mosquitoes that are n't drawn to the zapper live ; those that are die . Those animals that can withstand the frigid winter live ; those that ca n't freeze . Why is this so hard to understand ? Maybe I 'm misunderstanding the objection ?

As for procedures such as partial birth abortion and other attempts by the far-right to limit third term abortion , my understanding ( and granted this is from word of mouth only ) is that the legislation proposed was too general and purposely included language that opened judicial paths toward banning all abortions . For an example of this type of manipulation of law , if , in the murder of a pregnant woman , a law is introduced in which the killing of her fetus is also considered a murder ( making it a double murder ) , that opens judicial paths to counting the fetus ( at any stage ) as having the same rights against being killed as any other person . Legislators and judges alike are wary of the slippery slope and do pay attention to such intentional manipulations .
The cumulative Codon Usage Frequency of any codon is strongly dependent on the cumulative Codon Usage Frequency of other codons belonging to the same species . The rules of this codon dependency are the same for all species and reflect WC base pair complementarity . This internal connectivity of codons indicates that all synonymous codons are integrated parts of the Genetic Code with equal importance in maintaining its functional integrity . The so-called codon bias is a bias caused by the protein-centric view of the genome .

Hindus in U.S. Exemplify Capitalism 's Basic Virtue Francis Fukuyama 's formulation of the fundamental criteria of citizenship in European nations -- `` blood , soil and ancient shared memory '' -- captures perfectly the fatal flaw at the heart of European multiculturalism , and reveals the hypocrisy of the European contempt for the American experience ( `` A Year of Living Dangerously , '' editorial page , Nov. 2 ) . Critically , what is missing from that formulation , and from Prof. Fukuyama 's prescription for cure , is the role of capitalism , and the worship of the almighty dollar . As Hayek and his disciples have pointed out , capitalism is the most democratic and virtuous of social systems : dollars are not black , white or red . And a society that accords social and cultural respect to those who succeed in the economic sphere is , by definition , more inclusive than one based on any other set of criteria . Let 's take a really ( one would think ) remote cultural group in America : Hindus . Something like 40 % of hotel/motel properties in America are owned by Patels and their cousins . And they contribute to American society at every level : philanthropic , cultural and social -- because of the respect they are accorded for their economic success . One generation : from immigrant to university donor and honoree . But societies that place economic success well below `` blood , soil and ancient shared memory '' in their pantheon of virtues are fated to spend eternity trying to square the circle : integrating those who do not share in those historical criteria , and never will .

However , on Tuesday , on ABC 's `` Good Morning America , '' Pelosi said , `` we [ members of Congress ] have to find some level of compromise '' on guns .

Apparently referring to the provision of that legislation that would permit residents of D.C. to buy handguns in Maryland and Virginia , Pelosi added , `` we do n't want them crossing state lines . '' Meanwhile , Sen.

A firearm in mearley an inanimate piece of steel that has no mind of its own and cant function without the intervention of human control over it . So would I be wrong in the assumption than if a good person holds and uses a firearm , most likely it will only be used for good , just as if a bad person holds and controls the firearm it will most likely be used for something bad . So many of the anti-gun proponents basically claim that a firearm controls its owner rather than the other way around . So in essense there is no grey area in this , the person controls the firearm and is responsible for what he/she does with it . I have been around firearms my whole life and I have never once been a mindless # # # # # who is being contriolled by a firearm . So how is it that some claim that statistics show that people who own firearms are more than likely going to all of the sudden become some crazed lunatic who goes on a mass killing spree just for kicks . I would really like to know how something with no heartbeat or a brain has the intelligence to control a human being .

Only those ignorant of science and evolution think that `` evolution '' has anything to do with the Bible .

It seems that science is somehow anti-Bible in that case when science debunks ignorance .
I never said that it would `` impose '' on me or `` diminish '' my life . It would diminish the people who fall prey to behave in such a way and thus basically diminish us as a society , just as an individual might not necessarily be diminished by another man married to a goat , but we as as a society would be less if we had such unions . It would make our society less if we taught in classrooms that people and animals should marry each other . We would be a less respectable society , and in that way be diminished .

Correct me if iIm wrong but I thought entropy was the tendency of all things to go toward dissorder . For instance you can not take a bunch of watch parts , shake them up in a box and expect them to eventually assemble themselves properly wound and calibrated right with enough shakes and enough time . These things just dont happen . They are impossible . All of the watch pieces would become more and more random but never more ordered . So I find it hard to believe that one cell gained more and more intelligence or whatever to evolve into all living thing s that we know of today . There isnt a single natrural process that creates that information that we see in DNA , the information for how all things are put together , that would have had to have been present in order for that single cell to replicate itself and evolve . Life is a creation not an evolution . It is also hard for me to believe that out of nothing came something . I have wondered what evolutionsists say about what was going on befor the `` big bang '' that allowed for whatever it was that started the `` big bang '' to come into being . I would like to know what evolutionists say was going on prior to the `` big bang . '' Its jus that I have never heard a whole lot said about that . So if anyone could help me out in either of these subjects I have just discussed it would be much appreciated .

March 25 , 2004 Washington , DC - Planned Parenthood Federation of America ( PPFA ) today denounced the Senate 's passage of S. 1019 , the so-called Unborn Victims of Violence Act ( UVVA ) , which creates a penalty for anyone convicted of harming a fetus during commission of certain federal crimes . The UVVA would give separate legal status to a fertilized egg , embryo , or fetus even if the woman does not know she is pregnant . `` The so-called Unborn Victims of Violence Act ( UVVA ) is not intended to protect pregnant women from domestic violence or punish individuals who harm them , '' said PPFA President Gloria Feldt . `` It is part of a deceptive anti-choice strategy to make women 's bodies mere vessels by creating legal personhood for the fetus . '' The UVVA was created with the sole aim of undermining the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision , in which the Supreme Court ruled that `` the word 'person ' as used in the Fourteenth Amendment , does not include the unborn . '' This bill elevates the legal status of a fetus to make it equal to that of the adult woman who actually suffers the primary injury . It is part of ongoing attempts to bestow personhood on the fetus by granting it separate legal rights equal to and independent of those of the pregnant woman . This legislation , which passed the Senate 61 to 38 , fails to mention the harm to the woman resulting from an involuntary termination of her pregnancy . Sponsors of the UVVA today made their ideological goal abundantly clear : when given the opportunity to vote for a substitute bill that had virtually identical criminal penalties but recognized the pregnant woman , rather than the fetus , as the victim , they voted against the alternative . `` Violence against women , including pregnant women , is a significant problem in America , one that should be addressed , '' stated Feldt . `` This bill does nothing but shift the focus away from real solutions by undermining women 's health and reproductive freedoms . '' Because the UVVA is a Federal Bill , it can not actually be used in any murder case , which would fall under State Law . This would make the UVVA ineffectual in actually protecting a pregnant woman , but create a stepping stone for a national ban on abortion . An alternate version of the bill , which recognizes the pregnant woman as the victim , and includes a provision to the Tenth Amendment ( States Rights ) , was voted against by the same people who voted for the UVVA .

'I survived an abortion attempt ' Gianna Jessen 's mother was seven-and-a-half months pregnant when it was decided to abort the foetus she was carrying . A saline solution was injected into Gianna 's mother 's womb , which doctors thought would kill the foetus within hours . This time , most unusually , the procedure failed and Gianna was born alive , thanks in part to a shocked nurse . She was so taken aback by Gianna 's live delivery that she summoned an ambulance to whisk her from the abortion clinic to the hospital . She weighed only two pounds at birth and needed to stay in hospital for nearly three months . In an ironic twist of fate the abortionist had to sign her birth certificate . Now American-born Gianna , aged 28 , is in London to give her message against abortion .

A lot of garbage has been bandied about concerning the emotional trauma a woman suffers after she has had an abortion . There is no substantive , unbiased research on this topic but a cursory sampling seems to indicate that women who report great emotional trauma after an abortion were already mentally unbalanced , possibly subject to depression or dramatic mood swings or other mental disturbances prior to becoming pregnant and having an abortion . I am inclined to believe that such emotionally-disturbed women are incapable of making a rational choice in many instances and they probably would have suffered enormous emotional consequences whatever choice they made . But , if one could survey a sizable group of women who were in command of their faculties and capable of making good and reasonable choices , what if these women experienced emotional trauma and greatly regretted their decisions . My first question to them would be , `` Why exactly did you choose abortion ? '' I would like to know if they were forced by poverty to make such a choice , thereby not having a free choice . Or , if they were forced because of the stigma against unwed motherhood and illegitimate birth , particularly if they came from a very religious household , to have an abortion to avoid shame both for themselves and for their families . Again , not a free choice . Another factor would be if a woman were pursuing a very desired career and having a child or being disabled by pregnancy would injure her professional prospects . The workplace does not look kindly upon the demands of pregnancy , giving birth , being responsible for children . America is not a very family-friendly nation and women who are responsible for the primary care of children are severely penalized for having those responsibilities . Again , these women do not have a free choice in the matter .

Science tells us that there was no global flood a la Noah , not that there is no God . Now , if you choose to interpret that as a reasonable person and realize that science shows that `` a Noah 's flood-causing God '' does not exist , then kudos .

So one might say that there 's good evidence that a God represented by a literal interpretation of the Bible does not exist . But that does n't mean that no God exists , or that a Christian God does n't exist .

That 's not true according to the textbook claim : `` Before the industrial revolution , *most* of the moths were *light* . This was because the *dark* forms resting on light tree-trunks were more easily spotted , and thus eaten , by birds .

Sorry I missed your thread on that . It sounds like you are mainly concerned with health issues that could very potentially lead to the mother 's death and or/complete debilitation ( like paralysis ) , and I 'd be much more open to that . But as you said , we have two extremes to choose from , and SCOTUS chose the one that does n't take into account the woman 's health for this particular procedure . I 'd also add that because this is a late term procedure , if health is the reason to not take the baby to term , then caesarian delivery very well might be an option , in many cases .

I do n't believe it is DrNo , because by its very definition evolution claims that Man evolved from the lower animals . It relegates us to nothing more than a biological organism with no more value than an viral bacteria . Another problem you run into regarding Genesis is the spiritual relationship Man has with God and Adams fall from grace . Evolution erases that relationship which erases the need for the need for being reunited with God through the shed blood of Christ on the Cross . Also , you must redefine what evolution teaches altogether in order to credit God with original creation and then assume evolution is His plan for humanity . That 's why the evolutionists are rejecting your premise out of hand . Your version of it is a sacrilege because it goes from being Natural to Supernatural if God is credited with original Creation . One must not compromise what the bible says in order to find a happy medium with the worlds philosophies . That is folly and will only lead to confusion . What you should ask yourself is why are beasts which can only be described as dinosaurs be found mentioned in the bible ? How did Ancient , so called stone aged men describe living creatures at the time , in their world which evolutionists will tell you were extinct for at least 60 million years by then , only 6,000 to 10,000 years ago ? Here 's what I mean . Behemoth has the following attributes according to Job 40:15-24 It eats grass like an ox. It moves his tail like a cedar. ( In Hebrew , this literally reads , he lets hang his tail like a cedar. ) Its bones are like beams of bronze , His ribs like bars of iron. He is the first of the ways of God. He lies under the lotus trees , In a covert of reeds and marsh. Job 40:15-24 ( New International Version ) 15 `` Look at the behemoth , [ a ] which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox . 16 What strength he has in his loins , what power in the muscles of his belly ! 17 His tail [ b ] sways like a cedar ; the sinews of his thighs are close-knit . 18 His bones are tubes of bronze , his limbs like rods of iron . 19 He ranks first among the works of God , yet his Maker can approach him with his sword . 20 The hills bring him their produce , and all the wild animals play nearby . 21 Under the lotus plants he lies , hidden among the reeds in the marsh . 22 The lotuses conceal him in their shadow ; the poplars by the stream surround him . 23 When the river rages , he is not alarmed ; he is secure , though the Jordan should surge against his mouth . 24 Can anyone capture him by the eyes , [ c ] or trap him and pierce his nose ? Leviathan has the following attributes according to Job chapter 41 , Psalm 104:25,26 and Isaiah 27:1 . This is only a partial listingjust enough to make the point . No one is so fierce that he would dare stir him up. Who can open the doors of his face , with his terrible teeth all around ?  His rows of scales are his pride , shut up tightly as with a seal ; one is so near another that no air can come between them ; they are joined one to another , they stick together and can not be parted. His sneezings flash forth light , and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning . Out of his mouth go burning lights ; sparks of fire shoot out . Smoke goes out of his nostrils , as from a boiling pot and burning rushes . His breath kindles coals , and a flame goes out of his mouth. Though the sword reaches him , it can not avail ; nor does spear , dart , or javelin . He regards iron as straw , and bronze as rotten wood . The arrow can not make him flee ; slingstones become like stubble to him . Darts are regarded as straw ; he laughs at the threat of javelins. On earth there is nothing like him , which is made without fear. Leviathan played in the great and wide sea ( a paraphrase of Psalm 104 verses 25 and 26get the exact sense by reading them yourself ) . Leviathan is a reptile [ a ] that is in the sea. ( Isaiah 27:1 ) [ a ] Note : The word translated reptile here is the Hebrew word tanniyn . This shows that Leviathan was also a tanniyn ( dragon ) . Job 41:18-21 18 By his exhaling a light does shine , and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning . 19 Out of his mouth go burning lamps , and sparks of fire leap out . 20 Out of his nostrils goes smoke , as out of a seething pot or caldron . 21 His breath kindles coals , and a flame goes out of his mouth . Isa 27:1 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent , even leviathan that crooked serpent ; and he shall slay the dragon that [ is ] in the sea . How do we rationally explain these creatures existence so recently in our human history if they were extinct for millions of years ? And if they were the imaginings of bronze age sheep herders as your atheists/evolutionists would have you believe , then how did these ignorant people describe creatures we can now recognize from fossil evidence ? And while your at it , ask yourself if it 's reasonable that the bones of dead creatures have survived from 60 million years to some estimated to be more than 200 million years without becoming dust ? Does that make rational sense to you ? Just look at the egyptian embalming methods for preserving the Pharaohs . They are still a marvel to modern scientists yet they are nothing more than frail shells no more solid than the texture of a bees nest after a short 3000 to 4000 years in a dry and sealed sarcophagus . Yet bones/fossils buried in the Earth with the upheavals , alkalis and acids in the earth in addition to the weather have survived over 60 million years ? You must ask yourself if sciences explanations pass the smell test in the realm of common sense . And that decision is yours alone .

In a perfect world , that is true . Unfortunately , there is plenty of distraction and interruption from atheism . The proof is , that within the confines of a science class , just about any discussion of evolution , or websites like talk origins , or 4forums , the bloody hard work fades , and is replaced with put downs of religion . Ive shown , in another thread , how follow ups ( second posts ) to threads that open about evolution often arent about any hard , thoughtful evolutionary work , theyre effortless put downs of religion .
The fact that some scientists totally dismiss god is proof of there ignorance of scientific method . There is growing evidence to support the existence of a supreme being , and a lot of scientists are ignorant of this fact , yet they accept theories from the quantum level wich are not proven beyond the proof of the existence of god . Mayabe your mind isnt as closed as others I have spoke with on this subject . I do believe in scientific method , but I also have faith that god is out there .
The reason the dems wimp out is because the gun nuts votes are likely to be swayed by a candidate 's position on gun control , whereas non gun nuts , while having an opinion , are most likely concerned about other issues .

Back it up right there sinjin ! How dare you say that somebody has no right to take any action that might harm others even though there 's a threat that needs to be addressed ? Are you saying that the people on the 9/11 flights had no right to try and take the terrorists down ? That they should 've just remained in their chairs and behaved themselves as they waited to die ? You 're an XXXXX ! I say again , how dare you say that you do n't have a right to try and protect yourself and others from a dangerous situation ? It 's the duty of every American to do the right thing ! You just do n't seem to get it , not in the least . What you 're advocating is allowing the wolves to kill the sheep until they get their fill in hopes that they 'll leave the others alone . You 're saying that it 's better to be a victim and remain helpless , then try to fight back and potentially overwhelm and disarm one of the attackers . You 're basically trusted demented individuals to decide not to hurt you .

1979 , Would you ask the same of an environmentalist ? Would you ask him to pay for buying the all of the rainforests he hopes to save ? The scientific research ? etc . Would you ask this of any other cause except the abortion one ? This is faulty reasoning . No one who supports any cause is expected to pay for the entirety of that cause . BUT anti-abortionists do pay for quite a bit in this regard . There are help centers all over the nation . Have n't you seen the signs ? `` Call if you are pregnant and in need of assistance . '' Do you think that the woman will not relive the rape on a daily basis if she destroys the child ? Not likely . I think she will still suffer through those thoughts . Killing the baby complicates this . What happens if she has horrible thoughts about a rape with more thoughts about the abortion ? I would guess that you judge actions all the time without necessarily knowing what is in a person 's heart . That is , there are certain things you can say are wrong actions without knowing the fullness of what is in someone 's heart or mind . You made that judgment about rape . Who are you to judge that the rapist was n't craving affection , maybe he was mistreated by his mother , etc . No matter the reason he did this it remains wrong . Maybe someone murdered someone else out of anger , revenge , to further himself . It is still wrong no matter the reason . We can judge abortion in the same manner . Is the act wrong ? Yes . Are the circumstances contributory ? Possibly , but this does not change the wrong .
But you have dodged the question ? My specific question that I would like you to answer is why do n't you believe in the Buddhist god , Buddha ?
sinjin what does the word sophistry mean ? Its not in my websters dictonary . Certianly mine is at least 40 years old , so is that a new word ? In answer to your question sin jin . God just as he answered me simply above , does not always explain in detail his ways to mankind . But my study and prayer tells me that babies born who live only a short while , may have been saved from worse fates that awaited them had they lived longer . They may indeed be the lucky ones who were so loved by God he craved to have them walk the earth only a short while to be counted among men , he knew thier souls were not in need of years of learning many of us must do on earth to evolve into who we become . They were simple , beautiful souls who did not reguire the rigors of the world to perfect them . hope that helps .
I do n't agree with this at all - that is like saying that we should have invented 'black and white ' unions rather than allowing interracial marriage , and maybe put the kids of such unions is segregrated but equal schools , just to make sure that they do n't have to mix with kids who matter . Separate is not equal , separate means one group does n't matter as much as the other group - only EQUAL is EQUAL .
Maybe only one person could build a computer , maybe one person could make a car , maybe one person could run the mile in under 4 minutes . That does n't mean that God can do ALL of these things . It means that whoever we define to be the greatest being , we can call him god and thus he exists . Of course this would n't be sufficient to Christians as this says that God is probably mortal and has the limits of being a physical being .
Because it 's all quite clear . Decades of effort from the religious right , conservative republicans , and their like have made gay rights a poisoned topic . It 's a tragedy , but saying the right thing on this issue will cost you more votes than it will gain you , everyone knows it , and no one is going to do it . It 's politics 101 . The democrats , as a whole , want to do the right thing , but they know that if they say so too loudly they wo n't be in a position to do anything . They 're forced to moderate their public stances so that they can get into positions where they can actually take action . This is of course a generalization , but if you 're talking about a political party as a whole that 's unavoidable .

Actually , `` evolutionism '' does have meaning , but not in biology anymore . Biologists stopped using it over 100 years ago . From Wikipedia Some important concepts ( and why the word no longer has meaning in biology ) is the concept of an intrinsic need to improve . Such concepts were discredited with Darwin . As is pointed out , opponents of evolution use the word in a disparaging way in order to reduce science to religion on a level with `` creationism '' . While `` creationism '' is a belief in mythology based on no evidence , no one `` believes '' in evolution . Evolution consists of observations that are explained by the theories of evolution .

Abram , I would suggest you study cognitive processes and the evolution of both the human body and the human mind .

Nate Silver at FiveThirtyEight has an interesting little post up today suggesting that states with constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage are more likely to have higher divorce rates . Silver uses statistics from the CDC to show that from 2003 until 2008 , states with no constitutional ban on same-sex marriage experienced an average 8 percent decrease in divorce rates . Meanwhile , states that have enacted constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage saw an average 1 percent increase in divorce rates over that time . Massachusetts , the first state to legalize same-sex marriage , has the lowest divorce rate in the nation , followed by Rhode Island , New Mexico and Maine  three states that dont have constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage . The seven states with the largest increase in the divorce rate during the five-year period all have constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage .

Honestly Duck would you base your views off a 74 year old with parkinson 's if he were n't the pope .

Not the way I see it from my experiences . I let the readers decide on their own .
Caged reasoning on both sides but yet each faction has a similiar goal ; to decline the rate of abortion . Pro-lifers feel that legal restriction to outright criminalization will complete this goal . Pro-choicers feel that the means to control fertility through contraception will do . I believe moderate pro-lifers and pro-choicers can come to a comfortable compromise .

If evolutionists were honest , they would admit this simple truth . And since this IS the simple truth , this destroys the silly myth that humans ever evolved from something other than what they 've always been . Monkeys , no doubt , are no different than humans in this respect . Monkeys do n't generally have problems with their private parts being functional .

When doctors declare that no physical cause can be found for a chronic pain this means no more than in the present state of medical knowledge , nothing can be discovered that explains why the patient feels pain . It should not be inferred that a non-physical cause is therefore the culprit . Before invoking a psycho-somatic explanation of chronic pain , we need to be certain that a purely physical cause is absent : I do n't think that is possible . Medicine , like every other true science , is grounded in probabilities .

Sorry I missed your thread on that . It sounds like you are mainly concerned with health issues that could very potentially lead to the mother 's death and or/complete debilitation ( like paralysis ) , and I 'd be much more open to that . But as you said , we have two extremes to choose from , and SCOTUS chose the one that does n't take into account the woman 's health for this particular procedure . I 'd also add that because this is a late term procedure , if health is the reason to not take the baby to term , then caesarian delivery very well might be an option , in many cases .
Are n't you man enough to debate me head-to-head with what I present ?
It has to do with freedom and equality but then again I do not expect non empathic people to understand that . Looking at you answers below I would have though you would understand the concept that I get to choose who I share my life with , who I transfer my property too and who I call family . You do not understand that the government says to everyone who is a family by the issuance of that piece of legal paper . The in equality part comes in when I am told that I can not have that piece of paper but some hetero can because someone else has a religious belief that should have no effect on my life what so ever . I am saying that if so religious XXXXX wants to force their religion on me by using that religion as an excuse for the state not issuing me that piece of paper then I want a say in their life and want the government to remove that belief . If the religious XXXXXX stay out of my life then I will stay out of theirs but if they want to get involved in my life then I want to get involved in theirs . EYE FOR AN EYE equality by its very definition . You want the government out of your life and I want religion out of my government and my life .

I keep hearing gays say that but every time it 's put to a vote , you lose . I 'd say that it 's time to try another tact because the current one is a losing proposition .

You need a PR strategy that highlights the advantages of gay unions over bathhouse and gay bar existences . I believe that a true majority of people would support civil unions but NOT marriage . And I count myself amongst that majority .
The steps of evolution have never been observed .
To sacrifice anyone to the interests of others , to deny them the quality of life to which they are entitled , is an evil proposition .
And BTW , if you are going to refer to people as `` Antis '' , at least be upfront about what you feel they are `` anti- '' toward . `` Anti-gay ? '' `` Anti-gay marriage ? '' What ?
To expound on my last post : And yet this is taken to be fact unanimously in our history books . Funny how easy this book gets a pass .
It really does make one wonder though , if there is really nothing to hide , why are pro-abortionists so desperate to hide and mask the truth about abortion ?
Life at every level -- from humans down to bacteria -- exhibit intelligence and very often cooperation . Darwinists got it all wrong .
Every child needs a mom and dad if at all possible . Research has proven this . Our prisons are full of children with no fathers in their lives ! ! Two moms or two dads has never been proven necessary .
... any consistent pro-life advocate must urge any mother who accidentally loses her child due to actions she undertook , be charged with manslaughter .
Yes they have . Are you denying that conservatives and religious-right advocates have not been trying to ban gay marrige ?
You are so morally bankrupt that you 're not even aware that it is n't the baby that created the situation the woman is in
For some unfortunate reason , a lot of scientists seem to have moved from being fact-driven , objective observers to being what amounts to belligerent ideologues .
Creating a people that have `` free will '' is a messy business , IMO . We do n't do , the things we do to each other , because we were created to do so . We rip babies apart in the womb , for example , because we have to free will to make that choice to do so . I certainly do not blame God for the abortion mills across the USA . God hates the shedding of innocent blood . The problem is not with Him it is with us . Most of us do n't even care about what evil happens to others , in fact we just voted for killing babies after they are born . God is long suffering and merciful , but He is also just . So we can expect that judgement will come to our land at some point , ca n't we .
Hi Ursus maritimus : Nor was the peppered moth example ever meant to `` prove '' evolution . One important part of the theory of evolution is the hypothesis that natural selection is the major driving force behind it . Some sources appear to conflict this point , but if you say so .
No . You 've completely missed the point . But then again you like in the United Kingdom so I 'm not really surprised that you did . Your society has so much fear and distrust that it could actually be sold by the slice . Your paranoia is so pervasive that you 've insisted on the 10,000 security cameras being implemented in just the city of London alone . You 're so worried about a threat to your perceived safety that you do n't even trust your down police because you 're afraid they might wind up killing you . Fear is n't when you need a firearm to protect yourself . Fear is when you lock yourself away from the rest of the world and become unable to trust the police or your neighbors because you believe they 're out to murder you . Fear is when you give up your liberties and rights because you want the government to be your parents and protect you from yourself . The United Kingdom is nothing more than a society of fear , distrust and raging paranoia . Yours is a society that we wish to have no part of . Kindly keep your distrust of your neighbors to yourself and do n't try to tell us how we should run our country .

You have repeatedly alleged that ALL of these fossils have ALWAYS been found at just the right stratum implying that it is absolute evidence of the accuracy of evo 's findings and conclusions .

You could even call me a `` liberal '' while you 're at it .

we need more pro gun control advocates on this forum , there are nto enough and this is such a good debate topic . I think we shoot them down so much they gave up
With registration , people have to apply for a licence to own a firearm and in most cases successfully complete a Firearms Safety Course before the licence will be issued . With gun registration , the government has the right to deny a person permission to own a gun . This seems to be a direct contradiction of the premise & # 8220 ; innocent until proven guilty & # 8221 ; . Gun owners are worried that total gun registration will eventually lead to the disarming of the people and cite the Nazi disarming of the Jews after gun registration became law in Germany . They also cite examples from Great Britain saying that after gun registration became law , different kinds of guns will gradually be outlawed until no one will be allowed to own a gun of any kind . No amount of gun registration will effectively wipe out crime in either large cities or rural areas . In Russia , for example , private possession of firearms is illegal , yet there are accounts of mass murders . Modern day serial killers all had guns that were bought through legal channels . Even if gun registration does become law , the government has no idea who owns guns in the country . People who disagree with the law will simply choose not to register their firearm and no one will know anything about it . The fact of trying to get everyone in a country as large as the United States or Canada to register their firearms is a very costly venture and one that will not achieve its objectives .
Who said this : `` I carried a concealed weapon . I made the determination that if somebody was going to try to take me out , I was going to take them with me. A ) Marine sniper Carlos Hathcock B ) NRA president Charleton Heston C ) General Patton D ) LA police chief Willie Williams E ) Anti-gun Senator Fienstien If you said the anti-gunner `` E '' you are correct . Many good citizens carry a gun for the same reason , but to the Senator from California , she should be exempt from the law .
Until you are introduced to one , you do n't have knowledge of them . For example , you have no knowledge of the concept of `` hofflenosh '' , which is what this thread is all about , but it is still an abstract concept .
Illinois law requires that all gun owners have a state ID card and that transactions be recorded , allowing police to potentially link a gun used in a crime to its owner .

The reason that 's the case is because there are many limitations on marriage but only homosexuals claim they are being discriminated against .
One of the reasons included fears that the population would be dominated by the children of newly arriving immigrants , whose birth rates were higher than those of `` native '' Anglo-Saxon women . Abortion has been legally performed for thousands of years . It was also legal in the United States from the time the earliest settlers arrived . At the time the Constitution was adopted , abortions before `` quickening '' were openly advertised and commonly performed .
There is no evidence to support the claim that the entire Iraq population was at any point heavily armed and capable of overthrowing a dictator .
Well the Supreme Court has seen fit to say that this position is absolutely wrong , making it dead and buried and gone .

The law does not , and can not , dictate her faith & # 8211 ; it can only insist that she follow her oath as a medical professional .

That 's not something you can really blame on the pro-life movement . In fact , a lot of effort in the pro-life movement does go into helping single mothers . Many pro-life counseling services help single mothers offering support in a variety of ways , including financially .

So why does the slippery slope fallacy keep appearing despite a Supreme Court ruling that stands in the way of it becoming a reality , a decline in the number of gun laws , and little or no credible evidence to suggest that gun control advocates really do intend to ban all guns ?

Yes but Paul said sin makes people love bad and seek evil . People love others to do good , but hate to do good unless they see a reward . Catholics had to steal hellfire to scare all the converts from not caring if they went to heaven . Take away hell and heavenly bliss what do most people see as a reason for worshiping god ? People hate totalitarian governments yet God advocates one . Except for the middle east nobody is preaching the virtues of a church state anymore . The only reason really to worship god may be for social change . If enought people convert to a single denomination they can live the way they think is best with out being humiliated or worse .

But again , either way , it 'll be a moot point before too long .
Evolutionism does not stem from either science , nor the Bible . It is a naturalistic belief system [ or religion ] about the past , i.e . how everything here today - which we call the evidence - came to be .

Only a tiny minority thought that it was actually one of the small , lightly built coelurosaurian dinosaurs [ small lightly framed dinosaurs ] .
The validity of the violinist arguement might change if the analogy is to the fetus becoming a person some time into the pregnancy . Then the violinist analogy might be go something like this :
I am motivated to understand God 's creation from what I believe to be a biblical , creationist perspective . Evolution itself is not flawed or without evidence . Please do n't be duped into thinking that somehow evolution itself is a failure . Please do n't idolize your own ability to reason . Faith is enough . If God said it , that should settle it . Maybe that 's not enough for your scoffing professor or your non-Christian friends , but it should be enough for you .

I am for gay marriage being legal but that 's not what I 'm talking about . Are we so arrogant that we assume we are the only animals capable of thought or choices ?

So , you consider a so called theory which allows a 10 billion year gap out of an alleged potential 10 to 20 billion year age for the occurrence to be the most credible theory ? And is actually supported by the evidence ? If they have any evidence , why the 10 billion year gap for wiggle room ? No wonder you accept evolution as a rational possibility .
Perhaps those who are more knowledgeable on this can tell me ... The main purpose of a scientific theory is to establish a model that can explain phenomena observed in the natural world . An example is that we find chemical reactions always result in the same amount of mass as when you started . This , along with many other observations led to atomic theory . Now , let 's say that some chemical reaction was performed and it seemed as though there was mass produced by the reaction . Initially , this would be seen as an anomaly or faulty experimentation . If other people observed the same results similar conditions , an alteration of atomic theory , or a new model that is completely different from atomic theory , would have to be produced . However , even if this hypothetical experiment was confirmed , you would not throw out atomic theory as wrong without another theory to replace it . Atomic theory is a very useful model , backed up by massive amounts of observations and provides excellent predictions for the result of reactions that have n't occurred . To replace that , a model that explains all those previous observations plus this new anomaly must be made . It is also helpful if this new model can make predictions on phenomena that have n't yet occurred . An example would be when the periodic table was first produced ; it was able to give a reasonably accurate prediction of chemicals that had not yet been discovered . The question I 'm posing for this thread is , what exactly the theory of creation that will replace evolution is . This theory would have to : 1 . Explain the fossil record as it stands either by showing that creation occurred multiple times or that all species existed at the same time . 2 . Explain genetic modification and propose how responsible it is for alteration in organisms 3 . Present a model of interaction that can make predictions about life forms in the way evolution currently does 4 . Present a new system of classification ( the current Kingdom Phylum Class etc etc . is mostly an evolutionary system ) 5 . Be experimentally verifiable . If there is no extensive evidence supporting the previous claims , they can not form a stable theory . These are 5 criteria that need to be met to overturn evolution , though I 'm sure some would argue my list is too short an far too general . I 've listened to many creation v evolution arguments , but an actual creationism theory has never been presented to me . If you have any links to such information I 'd appreciate the info

Materialists simply hate the idea that life is an abstract , undefinable , unmeasurable process . Somehow , some way , the framers of materialistic ToE just HAD to make life a materialistic , definable thing and cram it into a materialistic , definable theory .
Here is Numbers 13:33 , it does n't mention Nephilim at all . Num 13:33 And there we saw the giants , the sons of Anak , which come of the giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers , and so we were in their sight . These were most likely the Philistines who were a large people . But I do n't have time to research it now as I 'm going to bed now . G-night ...
This seems to conflict with some of your earlier posts wherein you support terrorists .
It 's ashame that everyone keeps looking for the judiciary to do the legislature 's work . When will the people press Congress to take up abortion ? It is the job of Congress after all , to address the issues desired by it 's constituents .
A gun death is a gun death , whoever pulls the trigger .
The wealth of evidence comes up short , no matter how hard I try , and the main reason is this ; The more laughable ( by todays standards ) Darwins lack of knowledge of the simplest forms of life becomes / the more details todays science learns about the simplest forms of life becomes , the more glaring the scientific communitys inability to address origins becomes . That means less demonstrable scientific merit for evolution .
You should tell that to Gman . Most pro-lifers do n't care about women , Hentz why they are pro-life .
Were you hung-over ? I can tear up to the most silly programes when hung-over . Heck , I once cried to a re-run of `` XXXXX eye for a straight guy '' ( or something.. I`m not sure about name in english ) ... I was mighty hung-over though . Note that I`m not saying there is anything wrong with displaying emotions unless your drunk or hung-over , I cry even when I`m not hung-over I`ve just noticed this weird relationship between movies or tv-shows , crying and hang-overs .
Do atheist 's have an agenda ? That is a question you can ask yourselves- what is it that atheists are trying to persuade you to ? It would be wrong to portray scientists as paragons of objectiveness and virtue .
Well to get healthcare from $ 6000 per person to $ 3,400 per person you 'd have to pay them less or fire them . So do I understand you correctly that we will either cut pay or fire doctors and nurses ?
Is it possible for an omnipotent being to have a definable 'image ' ?
That 's the thing . JPSartre12 ca n't point to anything inaccurate , so you see this mundane complaint that *you 're posting something I do n't like* ... Quite frankly , if Christianity insists on trying to tell the government how it should perform marriages , I think that street should cut both ways and the government should be able to have input on how religion performs marriages ... JPSartre12 's reply is reflective of the *anti-gay Christians are seeking discrimination against gays , but we 're going to try to pretend we 're the real victims while we bash them* school of thought .
And for decades , evolutionist fools proclaimed they had decoded the Book of Life .they said that individual genes controlled individual traits . Well all that came to a crashing halt when the Human Genome Project showed that the one-gene/one-phenotype concept was indeed a fairytale . Instead , to the shock and dismay of teary-eyed evolutionists , they found that the human genome only has about 25,000 genes  over 100,000 short of their estimate . This meant their theory about how they thought life worked had to be scrapped .
You may disagree with my assessment - fine . I am at least doing you the courtesy of believing you when you say you formulate EAM with the express intention of promoting your personal philosophical views about life .
Averages tend not to mean much when 14 kids are laying dead in a school .
Lets assume for a moment that intelligent design is true , what can we then do with it ?
to me , a fetus wheither or not is a human being at the very early stages should n't matter since the mother has to take care of it anyway ; be it now or ( if she decides to keep it ) later on when i grows up . if a mother can make choices for a child , she can do it even earlier than that when the child is still a fetus . i think its all up to the women who are with child . they should be able to have the choice wheither or not they want to get rid of their child . if it were me , I only have one reason where i would consider abortion ; when i just am not able to raise a child . other then that , i 'm against abortion . but i still believe a woman should have that choice instead of giving them one option or the other .
But from your first post I see that you are not even going to consider any arguments , no matter how they sound , because you already made up your mind and said that anything creationists will say is stupid , crazy and anti-scientific . I guess you are a known scientist who knows everything and you are in a place to make that kind of judgements .
Sometimes a pregancy means death . Most of the time it does n't . Are we allowed to make this distinction since you brought it up or must we treat every pregnancy as life threatening ?
Stop moving the goal posts . My point was that the Supreme Court has been wrong before so assuming that the Supreme Court is always correct about an issue is unjustified .
''No , actually the earth is 150 years old . FACT . And its age never changes . FACT . '' -Chris Formage , Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas .

I have no problem as long as I as a gay man get to discriminate against libertians and and anyone calling themselves a christain . So if I own a business I get to fire someone because they are christian , jewish , conservative republican , muslim , or any anti gay person . I think you would have no problem with this solution .
`` ( 5 . ) We know for a fact that guns are used defensively 2.5 million times a year , as proven by Gary Kleck & # 8217 ; s very accurate study which made an estimate of between 800,000 and 2.45 million times a year ( a very narrow margin of error that is not statistically significant ) .
The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that just 27 % now say the U.S. health care system is poor .
I had no idea what a `` young earth creationist '' was until I read it on this board , 6 months ago . It is simply not an issue , and I am right in the middle of Kansas .

*A little off subject* If gay marriage is legalized , then so should multiple partners for marriage ?

Gee , Jo , you really should have read your sources . There is one part in here about the French 'navy ' and Churchill you really should read
It has a chance . Any scientist has the opportunity to study ID . We are discussing the science classroom . We already teach it as a hypothesis in most schools . But it simply should not be taught as a valid alternative to evolution . That 's what this debate is over .
Normal folks , people who are not just trying to **** on somebody elses religon or force their religon down somebody elses throat seem to be pushing for a secular and neutral classroom . This is not an unobtainable goal .
I do believe we have the ability as communication humans to define a word : Unknowable - can not be known which is the opposite of : known
my State is going to heII in a handbasket since these lefties took over .
The man has no say so whatsoever .
Lurch : So scientists are the ones who define everything ?
I am saying that I can prove all the arguments wrong independantly . Not that I have to .
and Hi it 's me ... .I find it truly hilarious that you are asking for any evidence -- since you can show NOTHING !
If somebody has a high enough threshold of pain to shrug off being shot , what 's going to keep them from pulling the taser prongs out while they still have muscle control ?
If that is your conception , no wonder you are having problems .
But guess what ... evolutionists call NS on the populational level random !
Ok , follow along ... There is NO TIME where God is concerned . The concept of time is part of the conditions of this universe ( that he allegedly created ) right along side everything else attributed to the material universe .
I contacted Oolon a short while back about two I 'd like to see added , nasal drainage and -- an even better one , IMO -- the human plantaris muscle . I 've yet to see a creationist explanation of that one ... By the way , chloroplasts have their own DNA , too .
Then you have mutations , which are all either neutral or deleterious .
Way wrong ... is it wishful thinking that makes you make this assumption ?
Two thirds of America supports a single payer system . There are many people devoted to this cause .
The funny thing about all this , and the oh-so-ironic thing is this : what is the ONE thing that darwinists have always pointed to to show evidence of materialism -- evidence that we 're merely an assortment of `` things ? '' It 's the GENE ! And now -- of all things -- it 's the gene that seems to have no physical reality ! The `` gene '' is just a figment of people 's imagination and subject to opinion and guesswork !
Okay , I see where you are getting at . This can be easily demonstrated and proved in the environment that it works today . I agree with you on this point , well done .
That would be beating the bejesus out of a kid as opposed to teaching him or her how to govern his or her impulses by themselves .
ah yes ... the `` what 's your point '' defense -- even though you just read my point ... which was the blacks got a later start under the darwin plan of evolution -- which prompted the whole `` out of africa '' version evolution so they could avoid their theory being labled as racist . That 's the point ... it was right in front of you . What 's your point for asking such a dumb question ?
I did n't mention that the physical entity needs nothing but nourishment , oxygen , and a safe environment to be able to grow into an adult human being , but that is also a statement of fact that can not be reasonably disputed .
Second Island ? I 'll have no choice but to parse this for what it is ... it is agreed that mutations can exist , but they only exist laterally , like dogs for instance ... you may have a beagle , that is short and not so hairy that may develop adaptations through breeding that aid it in survival locally ... but what you will not see is a dog that develop wings because it had to fly to the closest food site .
Says an evolutionary biologist : `` Perhaps it would be easier , and in the long run more productive , to abandon the attempt to force the data . . . into the mold provided by Darwin ''
Hey Pseudo , try discussing things without adding a strawman everytime.
Let me also remind you that black people were sentient . Fetuses are not .
Illegal ? How so ?
You , in effect , are still accepting this straw man depiction of Darwinism , even after I pointed out that natural selection works on traits that are passed on from one generation to another by individuals - not social classes or racial groups .
This post contains a perfectly simple explanation of why ToE is a sham along with a challenge to any Darwinist to prove me wrong . ToE is constructed on a fraud premise . This premise says that the fundamental unit of evolution is the gene . Whenever an evolutionist talks about evolution hes not talking about mere phenotypic change  hes talking about changes in genes . To a Darwinist , just because an animal changes phentoypically , or even if he passes these changes down to progeny does not mean that evolution has occurred . A fish could morph into a human , but if there are no changes in genes then this would not be considered `` evolution . '' The only way evolution can happen , by their own definition , is if there is a change in genetics . This premise , I suggest is a complete and total fraud ... and I will explain why now :
For the record - the level of assistance available ( pregnant or not ) varies from state to state . I was living in New Mexico when I got pregnant and a clever woman working at the welfare office figured out a way to fib to the state to get me the medical care they would have otherwise denied .
Obviously you have the answer to this question , along with evidence that your answer is correct and factual , ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
Just look up moral relativism on the web google search `` moral relativism definition '' will do it .
Ironic , since your `` Out of China '' post was basically the same as this post . You even claim you had no debate point , you were just posting `` information '' . It was n't until you claimed that evolution relied on those two mutual theories that we proceeded to debate . Maybe this young 13 year old christian is just following in your golden footsteps ... you might give them a little leeway if you , yourself , do this as well . Or are you above the rules of the average forum participant ? Hmmm . -Mach
You sign your life away and are no longer a name less face to the feds but you may be able to own one in your state .
Nope . Yowm could be day ( a in opposed to night - thus only around 12 hours or so ) , it could be a 24 hour day , it could be days ( as in a lifetime ) , it could be just a general term for `` time '' or a `` period '' . It could also mean year . Yowm can be translated as each and every one of those . So your statement is false that it is `` understood '' to be that when it could just as easily be translated as one of the others .
marc says some pretty ridiculous things on a regular basis here , but this one 's got ta be in the top ten . To think that there were no arguments for atheism or against theism before Darwin is the height if philosophical ignorance .
This is pretty random - but I 'd be willing to be the judge . I 've had a reasonable amount of experience with debates and I feel I could be a judge objectively . Up to you .
b ) The Bible . Despite offers of large cash rewards for anybody who can write a coherent timeline of the events surrounding the Resurrection without contradiction and without omission of information , nobody has been able to do this . The rising of the saints who were `` seen throughout the town '' surely should have been story fodder for years upon years , decades upon decades , centuries upon centuries , yet it seems from the rest of the evidence that the people saw the zombie saints and thought nothing of it .
Is this a debate over the accuracy of the Genesis creation story or just a debate over the general idea that God did in fact create the world and it 's inhabitants ?
Its good to see the senate isnt agreeing . Dangerous legislation that would have forced states to allow dangerous individuals to carry loaded guns in public was defeated in the U.S. Senate . This outrageous legislation was introduced as the Thune Amendment ( No . 1618 ) to the Defense Authorization bill ( S. 1390 ) . It would have allowed the carrying of loaded , concealed firearms outside a person 's home state , even by persons legally barred from possessing guns in the state where the carrying occurs . It would have allowed the weaker concealed carry laws of one state to nullify the restrictions on gun carrying of other states . We applaud those Senators who stood firm for the public 's safety and rejected the gun lobby 's dangerous legislation .
In the growth factor field , started looking for multiple forms of the same growth factor . They had no data within that hypothesis to do so . They just discarded the Razor and began looking .

`` So , anyhow , can you tell me , in a nutshell , how looking at the bone structure can tell one how a creature lived it 's life ? It 's specific habitats ? What it ate ? '' Outside of a nutshell , you still did n't answer the question .
I wonder if a large reason that most pro-choice people are pro-choice is because they have either had an abortion themselves ... or because they are very close to someone who has had an abortion .
Why did the boy part of $ 850 ?
What - did someone have to teach you how/when/where to be turned on ? Who taught you to be straight ? To look at boys ?
I probably should have phrased that differently . I what I should have said is that the Constitution only allows laws based on religion if it serves a secular purpose .
I do n't know , could it be because they 're XXXXXX ? Or maybe it 's because atheists are deluded .
Just thought I would ask ( for fun ) , what are your ideas for a same sex wedding ceremony that is not religious and is also not to `` heterosexual '' but is still is a nice ceremony ? In other words , what pieces of a `` traditional '' ceremony would you keep and which would you decide are too `` hetero '' ? I am sure this question seems bizarre but I thougt that would make it more thought provoking , not to mention I am serious . I am going to have a ceremony and was looking for ideas . Figured you guys might have some at the same time debate the issue of what makes a ceremony or union similar and different .
So even if the peppered moth case was really true , and not a fraud , it still would not be evidence for evolution as opposed to creation .
Lets assume for a moment that intelligent design is true , what can we then do with it ?

In fact some of the most ardent anti-abortion people I 've met are also some of the most ardent anti-comprehensive sexual education people as well . It 's like banning an action without trying to resolve why it happens in the first place .
What counts is understanding the functions of the various subsystems . A cell is not a dominance heiracrchy .
If it is moral for a mother to deny her child the necessities of life ( through abortion ) before it is born , how can she be obligated to provide the same necessities after he 's born ? Remember , Thompson concedes that the fetus is a person from the moment of conception . If her argument works to justify abortion , it works just as well to justify killing any dependent child . After all , a two-year-old makes a much greater demand on a woman than a developing unborn . Thompson is mistaken in presuming that pregnancy is the thing that expropriates a woman 's liberty . Motherhood does that , and motherhood does n't end with the birth of the child . Unlike the woman connected to the violinist , a mother is not released in nine months . Her burden has just begun . If Thompson 's argument works , then no child is safe from a mother who wants her liberty .
There all types of denominations of the Catholic religion . However , most religions that I consider `` Christian '' are really not the same as `` Catholic . '' Catholicism tends to be even more strict and loony than Christianity .

Ok , beat this responce . If it 's wrong then prove why it wrong .
I have been thinking recently `` What is evolution ? '' Sounds an easy enough question to answer , but all of my sources are kind of contradictory . Some say evolution is `` X '' while others say that evolution is `` X+Y '' . So I am rather confused as to a clear definition . Here is what I define evolution as : Evolution is a three part theory , we have : 1 . Astronomical evolution - the big bang theory . Explains how the universe started . 2 . Chemical evolution - explains how life supposedly came from non-life , or lifeless chemicals . 3 . Biological evolution - explains how a single celled creature evolved into all the variety of life that we see today . Is that right ? I think that many times that I get into an argument with several of you people is because I do n't think we both have the same definition of what evolution is . How do you define what `` evolution '' is , just say to someone who has no idea ? Thanks . Yours truly , Matt .
I 'll post another in the next couple of days .
The more we seek to redefine marriage , and chip away at Gods original design for the home , the more we put our families and our nation at risk . How do you know what God 's original design for the home was ? How do you know that God did n't create homosexuals for a reason ( i.e . helping raise children of people who ca n't care for them ) ? How is allowing 2 people who commit to love eachother for life putting heterosexual families and the nation at risk ? At risk from what ? This debate about gay marriage is really just the latest outgrowth of a culture that for decades has been drifting from biblical standards of truth and morality . The sexual revolution , for example , sought to bring legitimacy to sex outside of marriage . The womens liberation movement worked to revolutionize the roles of men and women in marriage and in our society . Throw in a rising emphasis on materialism and personal happiness , and you end up with a dramatically new way of looking at marriage . When millions of Americans view marriage from the mindset of Whats in it for me ?  concepts like responsibility , self-sacrifice , and lifelong commitment become secondary . Is it any wonder that our divorce rate is so high ? Or that the number of children born outside of marriage continues to rise ? Or that an increasing number of couples are opting to live together instead of marrying ? And now the push for gay marriage seeks to redefine marriage even further . From the moment God created marriage , it was designed with a man and woman in mind . God designed two sexes male and femaleHe did not create four sexes . Homosexual marriage can not fulfill Gods purposes for marriage.I realize we are not all Christians here . However , this issue of gay marriage transends all of society and it will have a negative effect on all of us . JMHO .
So ... . you actually think the collapse of the Minnesota bridge is because of gay marriage ? ? ? Unbelievable .
I do n't know exactly what `` literal '' creationism is , but it is the best theory besides evolution . If evolution is n't true , somebody please come up with a new theory to compete with creation . Right here , please , I would like to know what is option # 2 for Atheism .
The theory of evolution is based on evidence , the existence of god , is not..
How can you not see what it is ? And also , how can you assume everything is a human without any criteria ? With your logic , I have to assume anything that shares human DNA is a human being .
It does n't matter if it 's 'earth shattering ' or not . By admitting that we hold different standards for the Bible proves my entire point : hypocrisy on the part of skeptics . More proof to prove my point , thanks ! It does not matter what the document contains ! The same procedure should be done for every document . What the writing says is irrelevant to its authenticity ! You wrongly use Occam 's Razor as well . If the document is well preserved , has many copies , has copies relatively close to the original , etc , then the most likely assumption we can make is that the document itself is a valid source . Then and only then , should we examine the contents within and determine if they happened . We can do this through archaeological evidences and from other writings as well that agree with that one . Much of which we in fact do not have for many of Caesar 's expeditions , but yet again , we accept them as fact in our history books . But , it is funny that you should mention Caesar splitting a river . While he did n't do that , he did claim to have created a massive bridge in a very short time period and then destroyed it a few days later . Sounds like a pretty audacious claim from guys without any modern equipment . Should we discount this too because it 'does n't seem practical ' as we do with the bible despite the overwhelming documentation for it ? But here you are admitting that you set different standards 'depending on what the writing claims ' . Thanks again for proving my point I guess .
Direct evidence for ID/Creationism has never been established so there is no reason to suppose it to be true .
All of the observations that we see today can be explained without creation and evolution ! Neither are needed in the explanations .
I personally ca n't imagine a time that it would be absolutly necessary to kill a child , though there is a lot out there that I ca n't imagine happening that does .
I support embrionic stem cell research . Of course I support informed consent . I also think these are propoganda sights and so is what you are doing here . It 's far too telling in that you support a hands off approach to women 's reproductive organs around stem cell research - but not pregnancy .
Would n't this be a gradual change over a very short period of time ?
regardless of whether many religions accept evolution , as it stands , such does not fill the holes in evolution .
Some argue that the mountains werent that tall yet . That makes no sense whatsoever given the rates of tectonic plate drift . Plates move at 1 inch a year . Thats 500 feet over 6,000 years . Everest is by far taller then that . Some argue that plates moved faster . To create Everest in 6,000 years would mean plates would have to move almost five feet every year in the same direction . While plate movements are related to the Earths core heat , the necessary heat to have that much movement would mean the Earths core would have to be hundreds of times hotter . Thats way more then the surface of the Sun .
Great if you are doing what passed for science in 1350 . But your scenario presents no hypothesis for testing . As Occam 's Razor is applied today , one tests the hypothesis that requires the fewest assumptions first .
`` The Mexican Ambassador to the United States , Auturo Sarukhan , appeared on a CBS news program recently and repeated a lie we have heard for many months about the violence in Mexico . The ambassador says Americans are to blame for the violence wrecked on his country by the Mexican drug cartels because most of the guns confiscated by Mexican police can be traced back to the United States. That is not true , but the way that claim has been accepted by American politicians and the mainstream media raises suspicions about a hidden agenda . ATFEs Fake Number We can almost forgive the Mexican ambassador for being confused when the United States agency responsible for enforcing our gun laws , the Federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , has made so many contradictory statements on the matter . ATFE Assistant Director William Hoover told Congress last year that 90 % of the weapons seized in Mexico crime scenes can be traced to gun sales in the US . The problem is that 90 % number is n't true . Yet , that has n't kept it from being picked up and used by members of Congress , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , and , of course , Mexican officials like Ambassador Sarukhan who are eager to blame the US for Mexicos problems . Real Weapons Source ? The 90 % number reported by Hoover came from a small group of weapons turned over to the U.S. for tracing , but they were by no means all of the weapons seized by Mexican authorities . A spokesman for the ATFE , Matt Allen , has now `` clarified '' the number and admitted that only 17 % of the weapons found at crime scenes in Mexico have been traced to the U.S. Ironically , while Mexican officials have freely used the 90 % number from the ATFE , they have not themselves made such a charge based on their own numbers . The truth is , they know better . We can easily understand Mexico 's reasons for preferring the 90 % number to the more accurate 17 % . Mexico does not want to openly discuss the many other sources of advanced weapons being used by the drug cartels . Thousands of advanced weapons and tons of military equipment are stolen from its own military and state police . Weapons are smuggled across its southern borders from Guatemala and by boats landing on its 8,000 miles of coastline , weapons that often originate in Venezuela , Colombia , and Nicaragua , or from purchases in Eastern Europe . But it is easier for a Mexican politician to blame the U.S. than to explain his own governments failure to police its borders , its ports of entry and its military installations . Did the Mexican ambassador mention that over 100,000 soldiers have deserted the Mexican army in the past seven years and that many of them took their weapons with them and joined the cartels ? Lax Vehicle Inspection Certainly , no one will deny that thousands of guns have been smuggled from the U.S. into Mexico , but not the rocket-propelled grenades and 50 caliber machine guns that the cartels have in abundance . You ca n't buy that stuff at gun shops in Texas or Arizona . But for the sake of argument , what if it was true that 30 % of the weapons used by the cartels originated in the U.S. ? Could it be that Mexico has invited this traffic by its policy of not inspecting the vehicles entering Mexico from the U.S. ? Mexico only changed that policy two weeks ago and announced that it will beef up its border inspections . And could it be that Mexico 's decades-long opposition to a U.S. border fence and increased border patrol vigilance has something to do with the success of the cartels ' gun-smuggling operations ? Why Strange Obama Response ? But what accounts for the Obama administration 's eagerness to let Mexico blame the U.S. for its spiraling violence ? Two explanations are possible : It may be that blaming American gun laws is for many Americans an easy answer to what seems like an insoluble problem . If we can end Mexicos chaos by making changes on this side of the border , that 's far easier than expecting Mexico to make difficult and painful changes of its own -- like hiring honest cops and paying them a decent wage . The other explanation is more troublesome . Maybe the Obama administration has no clue how to help Mexico but sees an opportunity to help itself . It is obvious that Obamas teams at the Justice Department and the State Department are exploiting the violence in Mexico to justify more restrictions on gun ownership by Americans . The Obama crews hostility to the Second Amendment has been clear for months . This may be yet another example of Rahm Emanuel 's maxim : `` Never let a good crisis go to waste . '' Mexico needs to face its own demons , beginning with the corruption within its law enforcement agencies and at its ports of entry . The U.S. can help in many ways , such as enhancing our own border security . But adding more restrictions on the ownership of guns by law-abiding Americans will not help Mexico . If we are lucky , this theme of blaming American gun owners and gun shops is only a temporary distraction . If it is more than that , if the Obama administration really believes this is the answer to Mexico 's problems , then we are lost in a swamp. ``
In both cases ; human and bacteria , before the advent of a human product , a particular group of individuals from each larger group would die off .
But that simply is n't the case . Science class is for science , and any school receiving government funding should use it to promote real science , which is thinking . Until Intelligent Design can come up with evidence , as well as any potential advantage to the science community to ID , it will be nothing but a religious belief . And religion does n't belong in the science class any more than politics does . A completely different subject which has it 's merit , but not as real science .
Placing children with gay couples is not much different than placing them in the custody of pedophiles , that is , although a gay couple may mimic the duties of excellent caring parent/s , the morally corrupting and socially destructive influence for the 'guinea pig ' ( child ) of same sex 'parents ' is unavoidable .
And these concepts are something we invented

What disturbs me , though , are all the blacks , whites , and Hispanics who claim to be Christians , plus those who claim to be followers of the Jewish Tanakh , and who apparently think voting for a man ( Obama ) who is an abortion enabler , is ok with God .
One person 's opinion
Your analysis might be correct , although I do n't think I 'd bet big money on it . In particular , I 'm not sure about your conclusion here : `` The legislature is required to consider constitutional amendments in a joint session until final action is taken . '' My reading is simply that if they do n't reach a conclustion in one session , they have to take it up again in the next one . If it 's going to pass , it has to pass in two consecutive years , so simply taking it up in year three and saying , `` Did n't pass in two consecutive years , failed '' may be legit .
What you mean is that we should pretend that creationism has some sort of legitimate basis in reality ? The definitions were accurate . It would be different if someone could actually offer a scientific theory of creation . How about some evidence to support the `` theory . '' By the way , I 'm still waiting for you to tell us about how the definition of evolution has changed . What you really meant was the creationists had invented bogus definitions so that they could lump all of science under `` evolution , '' was n't it ?
Abortions hurt much more than they heal . Not just phsyically ( Side effects can occure months afterward ) but psychologically as well . Guilt , depression , so forth . In my view , abortion is murder , one way or the other and rare extreme cases do n't justify its legality . Even the rape victim gets a better chance than the baby does . They 're at least alive while they kill their baby . That in itself will eat at the person for years until they find some way of forgiving themselves . I believe these testimonies to be real , and I feel sorry for those victims who feel obligated because of family relations ' reputations to kill their own child . It really is sad .
Just about every other location in America has no problem with this being the standard .
I would like to know where the topic starter stands in this debate , so that a reasonable debate can take place . Do you feel as if they should be excused because of their mental illness , or do you feel they should be punished ? !
mercy and killing should never be put together . there is no such thing as having so much compassion that justifies you putting a toddler to death . Dont people realize that children are gifts and not something that should be taken so lightly as to steep so low in stopping a beating heart all for the sake of selfishness and convenience for one 's self.. There is absolutely no thought whatsoever in the baby , its all about `` how can i live easier without this problem ? `` . there is no such thing as compassionate killing . What it really means is `` killing in the name of mercy for my comfort '' . people need to start realizing that the world doesnt revolve around them and that life itself is a gift TO ALL ! EVEN THOSE LITTLE ONES THAT PEOPLE RIGHT NOW THINK DONT HAVE ANY RIGHT TO LIVE . look in the mirror !

** Just rece8ived a threat of banning from a 'moderator ' . Why ? Apparently because 1 or more darwinists have complained to him that I refuse to learn about evolution . This , of course , is a complete crock , butr apparently the 'mod ' never bothered to check it out before leaping to do the dawinist 's bidding . The fact is that I know more about 'evolution ' than most of the members , and I never stop searching for web material that will help me to learn more . There is , so far as I am aware , no regulation that says any person posting to the 'evolution ' forum must have , or be in the process of obtaining , a recognised degree in evolutionary biology , genetics , biochemistry , molecular biology , or kindred field of study . The fact that none of the darwinists in this forum is capable of intellibly explaining the basic mechanics behind his/her gene-based , genetic determinist , RMNS hypothesis of evolution 's driving force/cause/mechanism is certainly no fault of mine , or anyone save themselves . That is their problem , and if they can not sell their notion because they can not explain it in empirical terms , that should be their concern and nobody else 's . But for them to try and reverse the situation by p [ retending that their incompetence is my laziness , is not merely ludicrous and ridiculous , it is a scurrilous lie . Which is par for the course and comes with the territory when you are arguing with ideologues , but when you discover that there is someone who , given the responsibility of moderating a forum fairly and impartially , is acting simply as an 'intimidator ' for the darwinists , that 's when you know that the cards are stacked , the dice weighted , sand your voice will soon be smothered . If you hear no more from me , you 'll know why not . If the 'mod ' erases this post before I 'm 'disappeared ' , you wo n't . C'est la vie . ww [ Mike Turner ]
`` Even the sight of guns , which people think of as objects that can hurt others , can induce aggressive ideas . '' -Leonard Berkowitz

He presented no arguement as to why he thought that this was not mere reflex action . As someone with only a minimum of medical knowledge , I personally can not tell the difference between reflex action and a true sense of pain . That is true for most of us and seems to be true for this physician . I am left with having to trust scientists to distinguish between the two and scientists seem to agree that one needs a sufficiently developed cerebral cortex in order to register pain - which does not happen until the start of the third trimester .
Not true- there is more than one species of bacteria . In fact , there is more than one genus of bacteria , and so on . Just so you know , there is plenty of competition between bacteria within one species and even more above the species level .

Heading further down that path ... If the `` right '' belongs to the child , then the `` right '' obviously also DOES NOT belong to those opposed to gays . More specifically , the `` right '' to WAIVE potential parents as ineligible does not belong to those who are opposed to gays . The `` right '' would belong to the child to decide who HE/SHE wants , and it would be a bigger usurpment of this right of the child to DENY the child the option of gay parents than it is to present him with the option .

If you build a coverage mandate , will they come ? By Alec MacGillis Washington Post Staff Writer Monday , October 26 , 2009 People are more likely to buckle their seat belt than follow the speed limit , even though the penalties for speeding are higher . They are more likely to go along with hotel efforts to reduce linen laundry if told that other guests are doing the same . And the question of whether people will follow a government order that they carry health insurance -- an issue that will help determine whether universal health care is a success or costly failure -- will depend on more than the penalty they would pay for refusing , many economists say . This , they say , is the lesson of behavioral economics , a school of thought that holds that people do not necessarily make decisions out of well-reasoned self-interest . It is an approach that has gained a powerful foothold in the Obama White House . `` We 're human . And there are lots of other influences that go into what we do , '' said Kenneth Baer , a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget . `` One of the most important insights of behavioral economics is that we 're not all rational maximizers calculating our cost and benefits and doing things like a computer . '' As the proposed $ 900 billion health-care legislation inches toward the finish line , a critical unknown is whether people would comply with a mandate on individuals to carry insurance , one of the Democrats ' primary tools to significantly increase the number of Americans who have coverage . The Senate Finance Committee , whose bill has dominated much of the recent debate , set its maximum penalty for noncompliance at $ 750 per year , at the same time creating subsidies to help low-income Americans buy coverage . In the House , the penalty is based on income , but works out to about the same for a middle-class family . As the behavioral economists see it , compliance will depend not only on the penalties and cost of coverage , but also on the ease of signing up for coverage and whether people can be persuaded that it is a widely accepted social norm . They point to the large number of eligible people who fail to take advantage of Medicaid , food stamps and Pell grants as a sign that perceived inconvenience can keep people from taking steps in their economic interest . By contrast , the Medicare drug benefit program has achieved high enrollment partly because low-income Medicare recipients did not need to apply for subsidies if they already qualified for Medicaid . `` Non-financial things matter . . . . When the choice itself is complicated , it can deter people from making choices , '' said William J. Congdon of the Brookings Institution . `` The small hassles associated with taking up programs -- driving to an office , filling out a form -- have a disproportionate effect in discouraging people . '' The record of mandates is mixed , according to research done by Sherry Glied , a Columbia University professor of health policy who has been nominated for a position in the administration . The rates of people buying car insurance , for example , vary among states and do not correlate directly with the size of penalties for going without insurance . Overall , she found , mandates work best when compliance is relatively easy and affordable , when penalties are `` stiff but not excessive , '' and when enforcement is prompt and routine . The thinking is that people tend to settle for the default option -- in the most oft-cited example , people are far more likely to participate in a 401 ( k ) savings plan at work if they are automatically enrolled in it , with the choice of opting out . OMB Director Peter Orszag has done research on that point , and Cass R. Sunstein , the director of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs , featured it in `` Nudge , '' the 2008 popularization of behavioral theory that he co-authored . Some experts argue against setting up an equivalent default enrollment for health insurance , since it would require spending money and choosing an insurer . But others , including one of the behavioral economists hired by Orszag , Harvard University 's Sendhil Mullainathan , have argued for using the tax system to collect automatic payments for health premiums . washingtonpost.com
Huh ?
Since when does the word `` access '' get translated into `` must perform '' ? Women should have access to all medical diagnostic tests that can help them throughout their pregnancy . They should have access to sonagrams , CAT Scans , EKGs , EEGs , MRIs , blood tests , X-rays , etc. , None of these are forced procedures or tests now . While I have n't read the actual text of the legislation , I would find it unfathomable that any legislator would force a woman into a medical procedure .

If evolution was real , and consistent as it is proposed to be , then there is absolutely no reason why these other primates which we obviously did n't out survive due to competition as is suggested regarding the extinction of our early competitors , then they too should have evolved and in a worst case scenario we would have a Planet of the Apes type existence with a World with multiple intelligent creatures on the evolutionary ladder .

Just because he 's a hypocrite does n't make his movie wrong or his message false . Bush is correct about federal spending getting out of hand even though he was much of the cause .

Dogs become more friendly when testosterone is reduced in their bodies through neutering : `` One of the most important behavioral advantages of castration is that as adults , these dogs will tend to be less aggressive both toward other male dogs and also people . The androgen ( male ) hormones , of which testosterone is the most important , are responsible for the development of many behavioral patterns . When young puppies are sexually mounting their 7 and 8-week old litter mates this is because of androgen surges in their bodies . The same is true with aggressive behavior .

Excerpts from a recent report : `` It has been claimed that in the United States , 'guns are used for defensive purposes about five times as often as they are used for crimes'.1,2 This claim is made even though the criminal chooses both the time and place of the crime , most households dont have guns , and very few of the individuals who own guns are carrying at any time ... `` After controlling for other aspects of the surveys , these surveys indicate that criminal gun use is far more common that self-defense gun use . For example , in May 2000 , a Washington Post national random-digit dial survey asked 'Not counting military service , have you ever been threatened with a gun or shot at ? ' Twenty-three percent ( 23 % ) said yes . In that same month ( May 2000 ) , a Gallup national random-digit dial survey asked 'Not including military combat , have you ever used a gun to defend yourself either by firing it or threatening to fire it ? ' Seven percent ( 7 % ) of respondents said yes ... . `` So how can anyone claim that there are more self-defense gun uses than criminal gun uses ? They do so by comparing different types of surveys . They compare the results of Box B with Box C ! However , it is completely inappropriate to compare estimates which come from two radically different survey methodologies ... .. `` Second , there is no accepted understanding of what constitutes a criminal or a self-defense gun use . For example , criminals often believe that their gun use during a crime was in self-defense ... `` The opportunity for a law-abiding gun owner to use a gun in a socially desirable manner -- against a criminal during the commission of a crime -- will occur , for the average gun owner , perhaps once in a lifetime . It is a rare event . Other than self-defense , the use of a gun against another human is socially undesirable . Regular citizens with guns , who are sometimes tired , angry , drunk , or afraid , and who are not trained in dispute resolution , have lots of opportunities for inappropriate gun uses . People engage in innumerable annoying and somewhat hostile interactions with each other in the course of a lifetime . It should not be surprising that inappropriate , socially undesirable 'self-defense ' gun uses by people who believe they are law-abiding citizens outnumber the appropriate and socially beneficial use of guns.6 '' http : //www.hsph.harvard.edu/research ... pring_2009.pdf What do we learn ? The claim that guns are used much more often in self defense is based on making inappropriate comparisons . If the same survey methodology is used to measure both criminal and defensive gun use , many more people will report that they have been a victim of a gun crime than having used a gun in self defense . Most of the `` defensive gun uses '' reported in studies that ask every respondent directly about gun use are actually criminal uses of guns .

This book stands alone among many other publications of similar vein , in that it is written from a standpoint of a professional scientist whose arguments , besides their clear logic , are bolstered by facts of science .

A valuable addition to every school library .
I AM interested in what Supersport thinks about how his ideas will get wider respect and how he thinks this will change our society .
There are sections of evolution that include : * Astronomical evolution ( e.g big bang ) . * Chemical evolution ( i.e . life from non-life ) . * Biological evolution - two types - micro-evolution ( small changes ) . - macro-evolution ( large changes , fish to philosopher evolution so to speak , e.g . reptile into bird evolution , etc . ) .

An interesting analysis of that article you keep quoting from the World Net Daily . http : //www.saneguns.org/commentary/comment002.html
I reckon that evolution is still just a theory for a valid reason . It is untrue and can not be proven . Darwin himself said that his theory would be proven or disproven based on the future discovery of transitional fossils . There have been NO such fossils ever found . That being the case , even Darwin agrees that the theory of evolution is just man 's folly . Ya 'll can write millions of words about evolution , but what you lack is the proof of one discovery of transitional fossils The fact of the matter is that God created man in his own image . Case closed .

Another recommendation calls for the FBI to notify local and state law enforcement every time a person attempts to buy a gun , but does not pass the background check . `` Federal law enforcement should communicate that red flag to the state and local authorities that may be best positioned to address the threat , '' the report says , suggesting the use of e-mail alerts . And federal prosecutors should more aggressively prosecute people who fail the background check , the study says . In 2005 , the FBI referred 67,713 cases to the ATF , but federal prosecutors pursued only 135 of those cases .

There is no evidence in your eyes . There is tremendous evidence that the universe and everything in it was designed , even Darwin admitted that was the impression the evidence gave . Of course as an atheist he had to believe differently regardless of how absurd the story was .
Similarly , if David slew Goliath who is proclaimed to be from a line of Giants , how was Goliath born if all of the giants died during the flood ?

You show a gap to be inexplicable via natural forces by trying to explain it via natural forces . You ca n't do it by hypothesising supernatural forces , because that 's just meaningless unfalsifiable speculation . ID does n't have a different method of searching - all it does is give up quicker . That 's how it 'detected design ' in the eye ; that 's how it 'detected design ' in blood clotting , the immune system - it just gave up looking for natural explanations and assumed design filled the gap .
Mmmmm , not necessarily . Many of the arguments of against gods ( those with specific properties , not just a general diety ) deal with incompatible traits , like a square circle has . One does not have to search the universe to know square circles do not exist .
Why do n't YOU take a class on creation ? Or are YOU afraid that your `` faith '' is too fragile to stand a class on creation ?

Kellerman was n't fair when he did the comparisons for his study , do n't get upset when I use the same standard of review against you . I always find it amazing when an argument like this comes up . People like you have continually argued that the war on drugs was a mistake , that it was a waste , that it 's produced no benefit and that it should be done away with so people can smoke pot and do crack to their heart 's content . Yet when it comes to gun ownership , somehow the same standards and tactics are supposed to magically work and produce great benefits that we simply ca n't live without .
What sicknesses will we cure with it ?
Some actually search for knowledge through debate . This is a debate forum if you recall . Do n't play if you 're not so inclined but to post warnings not to fall in this trap , c'mon .
Both atheists and agnostics will tell you they see no evidence for the existence of any god . Some will continue with `` thus , there is not one '' and other will continue with `` as for the other , i do n't know '' . The agnostic position is obviously tentative , however even though the atheist does not explicitly state his position is tentative , you will be hard pressed to find an atheist who states `` there is absolutely , positively , with out a doubt , no god at all '' .

It 's good that these people are in the world and showing people that gay does n't mean sick or abnormal .

No one has ever observed an atom split . Why are our liberal news media allowed to present this as fact ? Moreover , are n't nuclear reactors designed by intelligent humans ? I also notice that this research was funded by our hard earned tax dollars without requiring that the benevolence of God also be researched in equal time . This is yet another shameful example of the godless attitude of science .

April 16 , 2007 : Seung-Hui Cho , 23 , fatally shot 32 people
The recent confiscation of a formerly legal firearm has raised questions about how the RCMP inspects imported firearms and has forced a change of national firearms policy . The RCMP will be physically checking every assault-style rifle that enters the country from now on . Before the change , verifiers were used to check to make sure the guns are what the exporter said they would be . Verifiers could be anyone with knowledge of firearms and were given a one-day course from the RCMP . Businesses that sell weapons were able to nominate their own verifiers . But the discovery of a gun the RCMP says should never have made it into Canada has highlighted potential problems with the verifier program . There is concern that the first loyalty of business verifiers is to the business and that this could hurt the accuracy of the verifications . `` We 've identified an issue with [ the program ] , '' said Marty Cheliak , the director general of the Canadian Firearms Program . `` There 's a perception of a conflict of interest that may be prevalent . In this case , we 're looking into that for sure . '' Cheliak was referring to the case of the Norinco Type 97A rifle . Sixty of the Chinese-made guns were imported between December 2006 and November 2007 . They were initially classified as restricted , based on information from the importer , photos , specifications from the manufacturer and an inspection by a business-nominated verifier . In October 2009 , the Canada Border Services Agency alerted the RCMP to a second shipment . This time the rifles were given a full physical inspection by the RCMP , which determined the rifles should be prohibited . `` Why did they make a mistake ? '' asked Blair Hagen , president of the National Firearms Association . `` If the RCMP made the mistake in the first place , that has some very serious ramifications . '' In March , the RCMP sent letters to owners of the Norinco Type 97A rifles , demanding they turn in the guns . This came after the RCMP decided the gun was prohibited after determining it could be easily converted to fully automatic fire . `` It was a purpose-built fully automatic firearm with the fully automatic features disabled by [ Norinco ] which were not reported to us , '' Cheliak said . `` It is very easily converted back to automatic . '' Automatic weapons , even those converted to semi-automatic fire , are prohibited in Canada . Guns that can be easily converted to fully automatic fire are also prohibited . The firearms association believes the gun was illegally reclassified , and some members plan to go to court to fight the seizures . `` The NFA is very concerned about the RCMP 's unilateral reclassification of this particular firearm and believes there should be a more transparent process in place to explain it , '' Hagen said . `` Apparently , they 've done a report on this . However , they 've refused to release that report . I think what 's required here is some transparency . `` They should demonstrate that to the owners and to the firearms community , so that everyone knows the truth and we can make a determination if the classification was indeed legitimate . '' Cheliak suggested the process is transparent enough . `` Why would we , the RCMP , or any police service give out information to any group & # 8230 ; on how to convert a firearm from semi-automatic to fully automatic ? That 's ludicrous . '' Hagen said owners are simply looking for proof . He does not believe that if owners knew how to convert their weapons to fully automatic they would do so . That quest for proof will be part of the owners ' fight in court , where they are questioning the RCMP 's ability to reclassify the weapons . Hagen said his understanding of the law is that only the federal cabinet can initiate a reclassification . However , Cheliak said he does n't believe the weapon has actually been reclassified , but classified for the first time . A proper classification was done with the physical inspection of the firearm . Collection of the weapons began in early May . The RCMP say about half of the rifles have been turned in . Those who turned over their weapons were eligible for reimbursement from the Ministry of Public Safety , which is rare . Public Safety Minister Vic Toews issued a written statement supporting the RCMP 's efforts to retrieve the firearms and saying the authorization of compensation `` balances the need for public safety with the legitimate expectations of firearms owners . '' Hagen , of the National Firearms Association , says the RCMP have put the Conservative government , a longtime supporter of the rights of gun owners , in an awkward position . For now , the owners do n't feel the government has turned its back on them . `` However , as this issue progresses , it is going to raise a lot of questions with the minister and inside the government , and I think the minister needs to be prepared for that . ''

[ i ] ( Before reading this , please know that I make no value judgements on abortion . From my perspective , it is not right or wrong or good or bad ... It is what it is , regardless of how it is perceived or labeled . If you think it 's acceptable as the 'right to choose ' -- good for you ! If you abhor it as 'murdering innocent children ' -- good for you ! I am posting this information because it is something that I discovered recently while investigating various methods of birth control ... And I believe that many people are not aware of the information I communicate here . I was n't . Take it for whatever it 's worth . If the issue is important to you for any reason , I encourage you to do some research on the subject . ) The answer depends on the definition of 'abortion . ' According to currently accepted medical terms , 'pregnancy ' does not begin until the point of implantation of the embryo in the uterine wall . And 'abortion ' is the termination of a pregnancy . So , according to the currently accepted medical terminology , the answer is no , of course not ! However , if you define 'abortion ' as the termination of a physical entity that has been developing since the point of fertilization , then there is significant evidence to suggest that the answer is yes . And absolutely no evidence to suggest that the answer is no . The birth control pill has three primary functions ( as do most hormonal bc agents ) : 1 . The primary function of the pill is to prevent ovulation , but sometimes ovulation occurs while on the pill . 2 . A secondary function of the pill is to slow sperm down so that they do not reach the ovum in order to fertilize it , but sometimes the sperm does reach the ovum in time to fertilize it . 3 . The third function of birth control pills is to create a less hospitable environment for a fertilized egg to implant in the uterus , but sometimes the fertilized egg does implant in the uterine wall , as evidenced by a 'failure rate ' when women are on the pill . ( In other words , sometimes women get pregnant while on the pill , indicating that all three functions of the pill failed . ) It is widely recognized by pill manufacturers and within the medical/scientific community that the effects of the pill can and sometimes do arrest the development of a human embryo that has not yet implanted itself into the uterine wall by 'creating a less hospitable environment for the embryo . ' How often this happens is uncertain ( some estimates are as high as 50 % while some estimates suggest percentages in the low single digits ) , but there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that it can and does happen . Your physician may or may not be aware of this . Ask her/him if you are concerned . Your physician also may assert that birth control pills do not cause 'abortions ' because according to accepted medical terminology , pregnancy does n't begin until implantation . While I do not personally believe abortion is 'wrong , ' some people DO believe it is wrong . If you do believe that abortion ( as in terminating the development of an entity after conception ) then you may logically also have to believe that using the pill for birth control is wrong as it may lead to an abortion prior to implantation . Hope this is helpful information ! The Bootfitter

This is a statement written by someone who obviously has not read scripture . One of the most astonising `` proofs '' if you will , that the Bible is of supernatural origin , is predictive prophecy . Science can not , as you claim , `` explain '' everything , and it has no natural explanation for the predictions made in scripture . How can science explain through statistical probablity the over 600 prophecies in Biblical writings that have come to pass ? Also , how can it explain how supposedly uneducated people ( uneducated in the ways of modern science ) wrote about astronomy as if they knew about the universe as we do today . How could they have described the hydrological cycle as we have only come to know it recently ? ]

What are the abortion laws in the USA and UK ? There has been much attention on the topic here in Australia for the past few months as the Abortion Law reform bill was passed last week . It is now legal to have an abortion in Australia up to 24 weeks without medical reasoning . What are the laws in your lands ? are they in the process of being reformed , re-newed ? I 'm trying to keep up to date with American politics but it can be very overwhelming so any info would be great .

Simply put , the majority of Christian teaching today differs a lot from when Jesus started it . In fact , I 'd go as far as saying that the majority of so-called `` Christians '' today are an insult to Jesus . Jesus used the bible when speaking to his people and he condoned it . Therefore , as Christians you have to follow ALL the bible . Not just pick and choose which bits you like . Christendom today gives true Christians a bad name , it is false worship . Take a look at these examples of `` Christians '' that go against what the bible teaches : The Roman Catholic Church permits the worship of Jesus ' mother marry . This tradition has PAGAN origin ( http : //bupc.montana.com/whores/marywors.html ) and was not part of the Christian faith . Even worse , the bible condemns any worship that is n't directed at God - Deuteronomy 5:9 ; 6:13 ( Jesus himself refered to this scripture when the devil was trying to temp him ) . One of the ten commandments strictly forbids worshipping anything other than God ( Idolatry ) . Plenty religions permit idolatry , which is a great defiance of God 's word - You must not have any other gods against my face . You must not make for yourself a carved image or a form like anything that is in the heavens above or that is on the earth underneath or that is in the waters under the earth . You must not bow down to them nor be induced to serve them.Ex . 20:3-5 . And here are plenty other scriptures not permitting idol worship : Rom . 6:14 ; 1 # Cor . 6:9 , 10 ; 10:7 , 14 ; 2 # Cor . 6:16 ; Gal . 5:19 , 20 ; 1 # John 5:21 ; Rev . 21:8 ; 22:15 . What do you define as idol worship ? The giving of absolute devotion and ultimate trust to something that is not God ; immoderate attachment or veneration for something ; respect or love that approaches that due a divine power.Websters Third New International Dictionary . Do you not see church members bowing down/praying at pictures , statutes , shrines etc ? Christmas Christmas is the biggest joke of Christendom . Christmas did n't get it 's origin from the bible or early Christians . Jesus never once said to celebrate his birth , yet he did say to celebrate his death ( i.e . what his life accomplishment has achieved ) through a memorial , or `` Lords supper '' ( this is a serious comemoration that does n't need any showy displays ) - Now as they were eating , Jesus took bread , and blessed , and broke it , and gave it to the disciples and said , Take , eat ; this is my body. And he took a cup , and when he had given thanks he gave it to them , saying , Drink of it , all of you ; for this is my blood of the covenant , which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. On that occasion Jesus also commanded , as reported by the apostle Paul : Do this in remembrance of me. Matt . 26:26-28 ; 1 # Cor . 11:24 To say that Christmas is Christian just goes to prove you do n't know anything about it 's origin . It started from the Winter Festivals which was a period where cultures celebrated the `` rest period '' ( agricultural activity was put on hold during the cold seaon ) . - http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_holiday_season This in itself is a direct contradiction of the belief that Jesus was born at Christmas - would sheperds have been out looking after the sheep ( as in the Nativity ) ? The idea that Jesus was born at Christmas was simply made up . Another reason why Christmas is n't Christian is it 's pagan attributes Yule and Saturnalia - http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas Christians are to shun paganism . ... There are plenty other things I could say about how the majority of todays `` Christians '' go against the bible and Jesus but my fiancee is going to kill me if I do n't get off this computer !

Licensing systems are very expensive to administer . Canada 's experience with its full licensing and registration system , begun in December 1998 , is not encouraging . The government originally estimated that the cost of licensing Canada 's three million gun owners and registering their seven million guns would be $ 185 million [ Canadian ] over five years including a one-time start-up cost of $ 85 million [ Canadian ] . But , by March 2000 the Canadian Firearms Centre admitted that the system had already cost Canadian taxpayers $ 327 million [ Canadian ] and was running up an annual bill nearly 10 times higher than the government 's original forecast . The March announcement also revealed that although 270,000 valid licenses existed from the country 's earlier gun control system , only 142,000 new licenses had been issued . Using these figures as a baseline for America 's arsenal of 65 million handguns , the estimated cost of such a system here is staggering . Most importantly , licensing and registration in America would have little effect on the vast majority of gun violence , such as unintentional gunshot deaths , suicides and the majority of homicides , since most homicides are the result of arguments between people who know each other and who purchase guns legally . From a political perspective , a battle over licensing and registration brings every gun owner into the fray . The NRA argument that licensing and registration is the first step towards gun confiscation has always been very persuasive with gun owners . In contrast , health and safety regulation of the industry focuses on the conduct of firearm manufacturers . Advocates of licensing and registration often cite automobiles as an example of the value of licensing and registration : we register automobiles and license drivers , so why not guns ? However , licensing and registrationthe primary purpose of which was to enforce a system of taxationhad virtually no effect on automobile death and injury . It was not until the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration was established in the 1960s , and changes were forced in automobile design and the driving environment , that decreases were seen .
I keep hearing the statement let the people decide or let the people vote . Why should people be allowed to vote on my marriage ?

I 'm not sure what you mean by either genetic determinism or neo-darwinism , but there is no contradiction between multi-purpose genes and evolution by natural selection , or the principle that genotypic alterations have a phenotypic expression . Just because a gene may have more than one function , or multiple genes make contribute to a single characteristic , does n't make any substantive difference to the theory of evolution , which you should recall was inititally developed before there was any understanding of genetics at all .
I do not argue so much the quality of llife of an individual woman but more for the quality of life , indeed of having access to life itself , of the children of the woman involved , because in many situations the concern and nurturance of a mother may be the only thing keeping children alive , especially in poor , war-torn nations that do not enjoy the relative wealth of the United States .
Creation : The belief that the universe ( and of course everything in it ) was created by some supernatural entity . To support creation you must first tackle the concept of something `` outside '' the knowable universe . Because this is irrational , the entire concept of creation is irrational to `` believe '' in . You can believe in it , but you must accept that the belief is not a rational belief . ================================================= The theory of evolution as it applies to life on earth : Essentially that the various living things on the earth are a product of purely physical/natural laws , which can be rationally explained . There is nothing inherently irrational about the theory of evolution being used to explain life in the physical unviverse , yet creation begins with an irrational premise , that we can `` know '' about the `` unknowable '' . It can certainly be a false theory , however , you can rationally show that it is or is not ( to the degree determined by your evidence ) . ================================================ You can not begin to hold a rational debate about the unknowable . It is not a rational alternative to the theory of evolution , unless you can somehow show that you are n't relying on the unknowable . I think many topcis in this forum are good debate topcis , philosophy , politics , health care , environment , entertainment , fun , etc . This topic , like a few other noteworthy topics , requires one side to abandon reason for faith , an irrational position , as premise . Keep in mind two important points : 1 . Reason does not imply truth , it 's a method of seperating truth from what is false , and you can quite easily ( and do every day ) , reason something to a false conclusion . There is nothing knowable that is beyond the reach of reason , this is why for someone to claim faith is somehow possible WITH reason , one has to try and show that reason is somehow insufficient for the acquisition of knowledge , which it is n't . ( see other thread Proof of God ) 2 . You can believe whatever you like , and it can certainly impact your life ( faith ) , however it can not be said that faith is based on rational belief , or takes part in reason , in any way , it is the opposite of reason . Reason requires evidence , faith does not , they can not be intermixed . This is OK if you choose this path , we can have opinions about it being `` good '' or `` bad '' , but it does not imply either , there is no inherent negative connotation to being `` irrational '' . -Mach

`` The Mexican Ambassador to the United States , Auturo Sarukhan , appeared on a CBS news program recently and repeated a lie we have heard for many months about the violence in Mexico . The ambassador says Americans are to blame for the violence wrecked on his country by the Mexican drug cartels because most of the guns confiscated by Mexican police can be traced back to the United States. That is not true , but the way that claim has been accepted by American politicians and the mainstream media raises suspicions about a hidden agenda . ATFEs Fake Number We can almost forgive the Mexican ambassador for being confused when the United States agency responsible for enforcing our gun laws , the Federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , has made so many contradictory statements on the matter . ATFE Assistant Director William Hoover told Congress last year that 90 % of the weapons seized in Mexico crime scenes can be traced to gun sales in the US . The problem is that 90 % number is n't true . Yet , that has n't kept it from being picked up and used by members of Congress , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , and , of course , Mexican officials like Ambassador Sarukhan who are eager to blame the US for Mexicos problems . Real Weapons Source ? The 90 % number reported by Hoover came from a small group of weapons turned over to the U.S. for tracing , but they were by no means all of the weapons seized by Mexican authorities . A spokesman for the ATFE , Matt Allen , has now `` clarified '' the number and admitted that only 17 % of the weapons found at crime scenes in Mexico have been traced to the U.S. Ironically , while Mexican officials have freely used the 90 % number from the ATFE , they have not themselves made such a charge based on their own numbers . The truth is , they know better . We can easily understand Mexico 's reasons for preferring the 90 % number to the more accurate 17 % . Mexico does not want to openly discuss the many other sources of advanced weapons being used by the drug cartels . Thousands of advanced weapons and tons of military equipment are stolen from its own military and state police . Weapons are smuggled across its southern borders from Guatemala and by boats landing on its 8,000 miles of coastline , weapons that often originate in Venezuela , Colombia , and Nicaragua , or from purchases in Eastern Europe . But it is easier for a Mexican politician to blame the U.S. than to explain his own governments failure to police its borders , its ports of entry and its military installations . Did the Mexican ambassador mention that over 100,000 soldiers have deserted the Mexican army in the past seven years and that many of them took their weapons with them and joined the cartels ? Lax Vehicle Inspection Certainly , no one will deny that thousands of guns have been smuggled from the U.S. into Mexico , but not the rocket-propelled grenades and 50 caliber machine guns that the cartels have in abundance . You ca n't buy that stuff at gun shops in Texas or Arizona . But for the sake of argument , what if it was true that 30 % of the weapons used by the cartels originated in the U.S. ? Could it be that Mexico has invited this traffic by its policy of not inspecting the vehicles entering Mexico from the U.S. ? Mexico only changed that policy two weeks ago and announced that it will beef up its border inspections . And could it be that Mexico 's decades-long opposition to a U.S. border fence and increased border patrol vigilance has something to do with the success of the cartels ' gun-smuggling operations ? Why Strange Obama Response ? But what accounts for the Obama administration 's eagerness to let Mexico blame the U.S. for its spiraling violence ? Two explanations are possible : It may be that blaming American gun laws is for many Americans an easy answer to what seems like an insoluble problem . If we can end Mexicos chaos by making changes on this side of the border , that 's far easier than expecting Mexico to make difficult and painful changes of its own -- like hiring honest cops and paying them a decent wage . The other explanation is more troublesome . Maybe the Obama administration has no clue how to help Mexico but sees an opportunity to help itself . It is obvious that Obamas teams at the Justice Department and the State Department are exploiting the violence in Mexico to justify more restrictions on gun ownership by Americans . The Obama crews hostility to the Second Amendment has been clear for months . This may be yet another example of Rahm Emanuel 's maxim : `` Never let a good crisis go to waste . '' Mexico needs to face its own demons , beginning with the corruption within its law enforcement agencies and at its ports of entry . The U.S. can help in many ways , such as enhancing our own border security . But adding more restrictions on the ownership of guns by law-abiding Americans will not help Mexico . If we are lucky , this theme of blaming American gun owners and gun shops is only a temporary distraction . If it is more than that , if the Obama administration really believes this is the answer to Mexico 's problems , then we are lost in a swamp. ``
I think they are doing it out of fear . They see the moral decline in America and they have latched onto the GLBT Community as their scapegoat . Since it 's no longer PC To attack African-Americans for their obvious differences , it 's not PC to go after other religions ( especially Judaism - not that it actually stops pure hate groups from doing it ) they have decided that attacking a group of people which are sexually different should be the way to go . I mean , their religion tells them that premarital sex is bad and wrong . Even though there is a multi-billion dollar industry based around HETEROSEXUAL sex , they actually depend on that money too much to bite the hand that feeds them . Insted , they attack a group that has not legal rights to marriage let alone little legal standing as far as individual rights . It 's easier that way .

Well it seems we have a contradiction , now does n't it ... . Michael Ruse : The most dramatic discoveries in evo-devo have been quite unexpected DNA homologies . It turns out that organisms as different as fruit flies and humans share considerable amounts of practically unaltered DNA , especially those stretches that are involved in development itself -- ordering the rates and ways in which the parts of the body are formed ( heads before legs and so forth ) . The jury is still out on the precise significance of all of this . Some seem to think that selection will now have to take a back seat in evolution : `` The homologies of process within morphogenetic fields provide some of the best evidence for evolution just as skeletal and organ homologies did earlier . Thus , the evidence for evolution is better than ever . The role of natural selection in evolution , however , is seen to play less an important role . It is merely a filter for unsuccessful morphologies generated by development . Population genetics is destined to change if it is not to become as irrelevant to evolution as Newtonian mechanics is to contemporary physics

Your arguing apples and oranges . There are laws already on the books , prior to the unfunded mandate statute , that prohibit discrimination in employment . Gays partners have no legal status today , so the granting of legal status to them will result in increased expenditures by business .

Of course it will have an effect on the gay marriage issue . It will prevent the people of Mass from voting on the issue and place the final decision in the hands of the Pro Gay Democratic Legislature who is owned and controlled by the Gay Lobby . It should also be noted that according to the Mass Constitution , the people have always voted on such issues . The Democratic Party controlled Government wants to change the Constitution against the will of the people who want to vote on this important issue . It 's just another example of the Liberals hijacking the historical political Process and reforming it in their own image .
What 's the difference between humans and chimps ? According to the blowhards in the scientific world for the past 60 years , they said it was genetic mutations . But according to these three articles , including a September 2006 Science article it 's cooked food and fire ... ..you see these things cause our genes to be expressed differently .
You would be a fool to think marijuana is n't harmful . You would be a fool to think alcohol is n't either . Although 1 beer a day is much better then a joint .
I really dont see your point because this isnt just a woman 's problem when it comes to these issues you pointed out .
... Of course , this last numerical example is questionable as gun control is more likely to increase than reduce violent crime . To put it in its most extreme form , suppose that tomorrow guns were banned , who would be most likely to turn them in ? Presumably the most law-abiding citizens & # 8212 ; not the criminals . And my own research shows that disarming law-abiding citizens relative to criminals emboldens the criminals to commit crimes .

Kudos to athiests then . That 's your answer is it : you believe your god just bodged together life in a convenient fashion rather than doing a proper job ? What a lazy-arsed god you believe in .
Given that this is the gun control forum , it seems logical to focus on gun control rather than other factors relevant to the crime rate .

Well , answering you seems to be a waste of time .

You are incorrigible and uneducable .
lol , no one has given a good answer about where this `` right '' comes from either . The constitution fails you , the belief of society fails you , God fails you ( as in this right is not given ) , so where does it comes from ? ? ?

I would be willing to debate anyone on the topic of whether homosexuals should be allowed to marry . I will take the position that they should not .
You lie . You keep saying the same things over and over again , that does n't make them true . Your addiction to violence is showing . Tony Martin shot an unarmed 16 year old kid in the back as he was running away . That 's not self-defence , that 's cold blooded murder . It is not the role of individuals to exact revenge for crimes committed against them . You do n't get to take the law into your own hands .

Why should they kill a human being in the womb , whether this human being is Arab or not ? Are n't the Arab and non-Arab created by God ? Why all this discrimination among the creation of God ? eanassir
Partly because it is entirely dependent on one particular human being for its survival , after birth the baby can be looked after by pretty much anyone , before it is entirely reliant on one person , if that person dies , the feotus dies . I place value on the life of the feotus because it is close to human , it has the potential to become human . The closer any being is to being human the more value I tend to place on its life . I value monkeys more than I value cows , for example , I value cows more than I value mice , or rats . I would only kill cows for food , not for sport or because they were irritating . Mice I would kill or have killed if there was an infestation and I could n't get rid of them any other way , insects I 'm not too bothered about swatting if they annoy me . The feotus I consider to be close to human , closer than any other species and , whilst I consider it wrong to kill it , I can understand why others do n't and recognise that banning abortion also results in suffering and loss of life . It 's a difficult decision for me whether the loss of feotuses is balanced by the suffering prevented , lives saved and freedom promoted by keeping it legal .
Yep life is sometimes incredibly fine tuned . Create and maintain an oddball environment and some existing species will move in or if there is no existing species which can use the environment something may well eventually evolve to do so . Microbes are incredibly efficient at this because of their short generation times . So are things like nematodes etc .
And although many darwinists kid themselves that they are here to debate 'science ' , they are not . They are here to defend their metaphysics and its place in their personal psychological identity , i.e. , ego , against the metaphysics of others , just like everybody else .

15 The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it and keep it . 16 And the LORD God commanded the man , saying , `` You may freely eat of every tree of the garden ; 17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat , for in the day that you eat of it you shall die . '' 18 Then the LORD God said , `` It is not good that the man should be alone ; I will make him a helper fit for him . '' 19 So out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air , and brought them to the man to see what he would call them ; and whatever the man called every living creature , that was its name . 20 The man gave names to all cattle , and to the birds of the air , and to every beast of the field ; but for the man there was not found a helper fit for him . 21 So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man , and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh ; 22 and the rib which the LORD God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man .
I think the difference is that apes act on instinct . They only know to find shelter , find food , and protect the young . Meanwhile , humans choose to act on their own free will . Because the human mind wonders and questions , humans decide for themselves what they want to be , what is right , what is wrong , and the results of their actions . Humans tend to focus on time/causes and results . Meanwhile , apes care only for the present and what their natural instincts tell them to do . Other than that , apes are hairy and look awkward .

We owe it to our readers to present everybodys ideas equally and not to ignore or discredit theories simply because they lack scientifically credible arguments or facts . Nor should we succumb to the easy mistake of thinking that scientists understand their fields better than , say , U.S. senators or best-selling novelists do . Indeed , if politicians or special-interest groups say things that seem untrue or misleading , our duty as journalists is to quote them without comment or contradiction ... In that spirit , we will end the practice of expressing our own views in this space : an editorial page is no place for opinions .

Teach the Controversy is absolute bull**** . The idea that we should be teaching our children all of the ideas and beliefs is not a bad idea if the ideas and beliefs have evidence . What is complete # # # # is that the backers of Teach the Controversy , namely intelligent design and evangelical Christians go into hissy childish tantrums when you suggest that we actually Teach the Controversy , where by including the origin stories of other religions that are NOT Biblical . Placing the evidence free story of genesis next to the evidence free story of Norse/Egyptian/Pantheon/Native America/Hindu stories enrages the supporters of Teach the Controversy . How can they claim to want to Teach the Controversy when they refuse to accept the teachings of other religions ' stories next to their own in a fact like implied setting ? Simple : because they do n't want to teach the controversy , they just want a back door into science class rooms for biblical creationism . And these people claim they have morals ... .
Creationists recognise it and accept it as it goes in nicely with the creationary model .
This is unrelated to genetics . The fact that I ( or anyone else ) can suppress bad habits does not mean that I do not want to practice them anymore . That does not make my previous actions genetically driven .
You stated that the global flood could not have happened because it is inconsistent of observable science , correct ? Therefore , you are assuming that God is constrained by observable science .

Keep up the good work , I 'm really proud of your progress .
But on the other hand I do n't confuse my faith with science based on evidence . Evolution is not my faith and I take none of it by faith .

JUSTICE SOUTER : Can we also look to current 13 conditions like current crime statistics ? 14 MR. GURA : To some extent , Your Honor , but we have certainly -- 16 JUSTICE SOUTER : Well , can they consider the 17 extent of the murder rate in Washington , D.C. , using 18 handguns ? 19 MR. GURA : If we were to consider the extent of the murder rate with handguns , the law would not 21 survive any type of review , Your Honor . 22 JUSTICE SCALIA : All the more reason to 23 allow a homeowner to have a handgun . 24 MR. GURA : Absolutely , Your Honor . JUSTICE BREYER : Whose judgment is that 78 Alderson Reporting Company 5 10 15 20 25 Official - Subject to Final Review 1 to -- 2 JUSTICE SOUTER : The question is whether 3 they may consider those statistics , and I take it your 4 answer is yes ? MR. GURA : Well , those statistics might be 6 considered in some way , the fact is that at some point 7 there is a role for judicial review . And you ca n't just 8 grab at statistics -- and some of the statistics that 9 were used here are very weak , and studies that have been rejected by the National Academy of Sciences repeatedly . 11 I mean , we do n't really have -- it 's hard to say that 12 those laws -- 13 JUSTICE SOUTER : But I think -- I do n't want 14 you to misunderstand my question . My question is that by looking to the statistics , I 'm not suggesting that 16 there is only sort of one reasonable response to them . 17 I want to know whether -- whether the policymakers may 18 look to them ; and I take it your answer is yes ? 19 MR. GURA : To some degree , yes , policymakers have to be informed by what 's going on in order to make 21 policy . However , there are constitutional limitations 22 enforced by courts that are going to limit those 23 policies . And when you have a ban which bans 40 percent 24 of all weapons that are the type of weapons used by civilians , 80 percent of all self-defense occurs with 79 Alderson Reporting Company 5 10 15 20 25 Official - Subject to Final Review 1 handguns ; when you have that kind of ban , functional 2 firearms ban , these are extreme measures -- 3 JUSTICE SOUTER : They may be . I just want 4 to make sure you 're not making the argument that because there was not a comparable homicide rate , or for that 6 matter , a comparable need for self-defense from handgun 7 use in 1792 , that there -- 1790 -- that therefore , the 8 statistics of today may not be considered ? You 're not 9 making that argument ? MR. GURA : No , Your Honor , the fact is that 11 we can always debate these things , but the object of the 12 Bill of Rights is to remove certain judgments from the 13 legislature , because we can make policy arguments , 14 normative arguments about many provisions of the Constitution . But to make those arguments and say , 16 well , we 've decided as a matter of policy that the right 17 to keep and bear arms is no longer a good idea and , 18 therefore , we are going to have restrictions that 19 violate that stricture in the Bill of Rights , that should n't pass judicial review . At some point you have 21 to go to Article 5 if you think that the Constitution is 22 impractical . 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY : But Just to be clear -- 24 and I do n't want to misstate your position , but my understanding , I at least inferred that you would 80 Alderson Reporting Company
Huh ? I 'd love to live in a world where abortions were never necessary , that does n't mean I think it 's a bad thing .

Actually there is a better solution . Mandatory male and female birth control pills , financial penalties if you stop taking . Anyone who would get off the pill would want a kid , therefore , abortions would cease .

During an interview on ABC 's `` Good Morning America , '' Pelosi said that the Congress will work to find some middle ground between the previous ban , which expired in 2004 , and the precedent laid by the Supreme Court in a ruling enumerating more concrete gunowners ' rights last term `` We have to find some level of compromise , '' Pelosi said , citing 53 victims of gun violence nationwide in less than a month . `` And we have to rid the debate of the misconceptions people have about what gun safety means . '' Pelosi indicated that new regulations might entail registration and prohibitions on transporting some firearms across state lines .

If they are produced from human minds , and human minds are mutually contradictory , then how can the constructs be absolute ? Therefore , the laws of logic are not human constructs .

Nowhere in the Bible is abortion specifically prohibited but the foundation of Christian argument from a biblical perspective is the fact that the unborn being is established as a person from the moment of creation . The unborn being is considered a child . Thus the commandment , `` Thou shalt not kill '' applies . Check out some of these verses as a start : Exodus 21:22-25 , Psalm 139:13-16 , Psalm 71:6 , Deutoronomy 30:19 , Luke 1:15 and 1:41 , Isaiah 49:1 , Jeremiah1:5 , 1 Corinthians 6:19-20

I have seen this response from several people and have always wondered why some people would use religion as a crutch . It seems like it would be way too hard to do , but I still see more and more sad people choking on prayers . It 's a shame to be so bent on shouting praise to a higher power and never getting the results one needs . That goes back to the `` feel good '' god , or the `` I 'm better than most '' god . Looks like these people never get the desired results or else they 'd stop and look at their fading gills .

MEXICO CITY  Guards and officials at a prison in northern Mexico allegedly let inmates out , lent them guns and allowed them to use official vehicles to carry out drug-related killings , including the massacre of 17 people last week , prosecutors said Sunday . After carrying out the killings the inmates would return to their cells , the Attorney General 's Office said in a revelation that was shocking even for a country wearied by years of drug violence and corruption . `` According to witnesses , the inmates were allowed to leave with authorization of the prison director ... to carry out instructions for revenge attacks using official vehicles and using guards ' weapons for executions , '' office spokesman Ricardo Najera said at a news conference . The director of the prison in Gomez Palacio in Durango state and three other officials were placed under a form of house arrest pending further investigation . No charges have yet been filed . Prosecutors said the prison-based hit squad is suspected in three mass shootings , including the July 18 attack on a party in the city of Torreon , which is near Gomez Palacio . In that incident , gunmen fired indiscriminately into a crowd of mainly young people in a rented hall , killing 17 people , including women . Police found more than 120 bullet casings at the scene , and Najera said tests matched those casings to four assault rifles assigned to guards at the prison . Similar ballistics tests linked the guns to earlier killings at two bars in Torreon , the capital of northern Coahuila state , he said . At least 16 people were killed in those attacks on Feb. 1 and May 15 , local media reported . Najera blamed the killings on disputes between rival drug cartels . `` Unfortunately , the criminals also carried out cowardly killings of innocent civilians , only to return to their cells , '' he said . Coahuila and neighboring Durango are among several northern states that have seen a spike in drug-related violence that authorities attribute to a fight between the Gulf cartel and its former enforcers , known as the Zetas . Mexico has long had a problem with investigating crimes , catching criminals and convicting people . Reports estimate less than 2 percent of crimes in Mexico result in prison sentences . But Sunday 's revelation suggests that even putting cartel gunmen in prison may not prevent them from continuing to commit crimes . Interior Secretary Francisco Blake said the revelation `` can only be seen as a wake-up call for authorities to address , once again , the state of deterioration in many local law enforcement institutions ... we can not allow this kind of thing to happen again . '' Also Sunday , Mexican federal police announced the arrest of an alleged leading member of a drug gang blamed in recent killings and a car-bombing in the violence-ridden border city of Ciudad Juarez , across from El Paso , Texas . Police described Luis Vazquez Barragan , 39 , as a top member of La Linea gang , the enforcement arm of the Juarez cartel , saying he received orders directly from cartel boss Vicente Carrillo Fuentes . Vazquez Barragan allegedly organized payments , moved drugs and oversaw a system of safe houses in and around Ciudad Juarez . Police said he held the same rank as fugitive gang leader Juan Pablo Ledezma , though Vazquez Barragan is not named on reward or most-wanted lists published by the Attorney General 's Office , as Ledezma is . La Linea has been blamed for a car bomb that killed three people July 15 in Ciudad Juarez and for two separate shootings March 13 that killed a U.S. consular employee and two other people connected to the consulate . Police did not say when they caught Vazquez Barragan , but he was allegedly in possession of about a half-kilogram ( pound ) of cocaine and two guns . His arrest led to a raid on a safe house where authorities detained four suspects and freed a kidnap victim . Also Sunday , the Attorney General 's Office said soldiers on patrol in Ciudad Madero in the border state of Tamaulipas seized an arsenal of about three dozen guns , 17 grenades and thousands of bullets in a house . Elsewhere in Tamaulipas , police and prosecutors raided a lot full of truck-pulled tankers in the border city of Reynosa and seized two loaded with oil of a type sometimes stolen from the pipelines of the state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos . Nore than a dozen other tankers and freight containers were also seized . Mexican drug cartels have allegedly become involved in increasingly sophisticated thefts of fuel and oil from Mexico 's pipelines . In the Pacific coast state of Guerrero , authorities reported Sunday they had found the bullet-ridden bodies of six men dumped in various locations , including three in or around the resort of Acapulco . Two of the dead men were identified as people kidnapped earlier in the month .
And the thing that materialists really hate is the concept of miracles .they hate the concept that something real could be beyond the power of their beloved laws of physics and chemistry . This seems to be the thing that really separates Christians from materialists  Christians readily , accept  even revel in  the notion that Jesus died on the cross and rose in 3 days .we revel in the fact that Christ made a return and was seen by his disciples and hundreds more after his death . We revel in the fact that Jesus turned water into wine and glowed a glorious bright , white light up on the mountain . Etc etc
DamEtel : Perhaps , though , we immortal mules , by simply repairing ourselves and maintaining the status quo , would still somehow die : after all , nature shows us that those organisms that dont adapt to the ever changing conditions on Earth just dont last . Perhaps the changes in our environment would be too dramatic to be handled by simply replacing what is damaged with a new part . This line of reasoning fails since our intent is not simply to repair ourselves , but to improve ourselves as well . Humans intend to direct their own bodily evolution , either via installed hardware or through genetic manipulations , adapting our bodies to changes in the environment .
Hahahaha , there could be 100 crazed flat-earth creationists joining with me in asking questions about evolution and astronomy , and it wouldn & # 8217 ; t be within light years of the panic and scrambling that evolutionists/atheists have been doing for years now concerning ID .
That much is obvious . The legislation gives a special out for RELIGIOUS reasons , but says nothing about non-religious reasons . Duh !
But it is based on history . There is plenty of history showing that women had illegal abortions .
Sigh . You defend your version of science by re-stating the definition of your version of science . That is circular reasoning .
By the same logic many economists use , we could find any number of absurd things . For example there is a well known correlation between skyscraper construction and economic downturn , we could conclude from this that tall buildings depress economies and that recessions can be avoided if we disallow the construction of record-height buildings . The other thing economists need to realise is that economic statistics are entirely historical , they provide empirical information about a particular group at a particular time , not universal truths about mankinds ' behaviour in general . Even if we run an experimental design in the realm of human action showing X causes Y , differing social and cultural norms may result in the precise opposite effect at another period of time .
Since that would be me let 's go over my position and you tell me which parts are n't reasonable and why : 1 . I 've advocated registration of all handguns but not all guns . 2 . I 've advocated mandatory secure storage for unattended firearms , like when you 're not home . 3 . I 've advocated photographing and fingerprinting for all handgun purchases .
EDIT : To sum it all up , the Big Bang Theory states that 'nothing exploded and the universe was formed ! '
How can it get anymore embarrassing for science that they got the premise wrong for all these years ?
No , its not . Thats a strawman . I have never stated anything of the sort .
Very well said , but remember , Evolution doesnt mean atheism , but creationism means religion .
I do tend to group atheist and theistic evolutionist together because theistic evolutionist create their own god to conform with unproven and constantly changing scientific senarios of the origin of life etc . This is unfair to the atheist who I respect for having conviction . As far as why most scientist agree I find has more to do with their worldview in many cases that their vocational skills . Why did most scientist agree with Piltdown Man or Nebraska man ? It proves nothing in most cases . In the case of gravity it seems to make sense as most items heavier than air tend to fall to earth . Dinos to birds is a worldview not a scientific opinion . IT did it . As far as the Bible you should read it sometime . It is full of things we did not know until very recently like ocean currents , what caused the wind , to wash after touching dead bodies and many , many more . [ /QUOTE Here you 're just flagrantly wrong . For info on the link between dinosaurs and birds , as an example , please follow this link and see the excellent post by pandion on this topic . And before we address the Big Bang , I should point out that the validity of that theory really has nothing to do with evolution . As for proof of it , we have the expanding universe around us , and the theory also predicts the same levels of cosmic background radiation that we actually see everywhere . Could there be other explanations ? Possibly . But the Big Bang is still the best we 've got . flagrantly wrong ? That is a new one . Give me one , just one , peer reviewed paper proving any link between birds and dinosaurs . It is a religious/political belief and a fairly recent one at that . The big bang is just as much a part of evolution as geology or palentology etc . Everytime one branch of `` science '' comes up with a new date for the earth and the cosmos all the other branches must agree or evolution dies . IT must be preserved . The best according to who ? Who is we ? The same people who used to believe that natural selection alone explained the origin of the species or that granted 200 Doctorates written on Piltdown Man ? It is the same argument you said was fallacious -most scientist agree . Well , if some of the implications of quantum theory are correct ( and do n't quote me on this ) , then some of those things are actually possible . However , as any scientist worth his/her salt will tell you , just because something is possible does n't mean it 's definite . I do n't see any proof of those things happening any time soon , either , but they 're fun to think about , are n't they ? It is an interesting concept , I think much is learned by looking for answers even in the wrong place . To quote it as gospel which many evolutionist do is absurd . Being facetious rarely works in winning converts . Please get back to us when you have a chance to review panion 's posts and think a little harder about your arguments .

Ummm ... what 's to explain , none of those contradict with theistic evolution , at all .
Could it partially be the fact that they do n't want antiquated belief system dogma making their decisions ? Must have access to a sonogram sounds like a lobby group attempting to sway opinion while enhancing revenue . Does the legislation force pregnant women who have not chosen abortion to have a sonogram ? Raising children creates post-delivery stress syndrome .
This is n't exact but here 's the basics I think are right : Evolutionists : We base our belief the Universe was formed 20 billion years ago . The Earth was formed 4.5 billion years ago . We speculate a rise in concentrated energy cause a massive explosion that resulted in millions of particles bumping into each other and eventually forming galaxies with in the universe , and planets with the galaxies . The planets , well one planet so far , managed to become inhabitable by life forms , that managed to survive and evolve over time . Admittedly we have some serious gaps and flaws here and there , but it 's better than the mythological garbage of Zeus or any other God for that matter , creating the world . Mass can neither be created or destroyed . Christian : God did it . ( Then you could visit Dr. Hovind , or other creationists for some logic and reasoning ) Of course both sides will say the other has fallible evidence . No matter what you 'll never be able to convince the other side that they are wrong because you have the extraneous variable of faith ... ... and faith being abstract and science being more of a physical nature is like saying oil is going to mix with water . So the ultimate answer comes down to your own convictions , knowledge , and experiences . Leaving the answer to the life long mystery as to `` Why are we here ? '' up to the individual he or she must find the answer themself .

I 've had an abortion , at 9 weeks gestation . I 'm not proud of it , but I 'm not ashamed of it either - it was the best decision for me at the time . And I remain pro-choice . My choice was not 'just ' my rights at the time , it was the priority of my existing family and our lives . Just about the rights of the mother ? It 's interesting to note that the mothers rights ( and the rights of her family , her children ? ) are obviously of much lower value to you than the rights of a fetus .
Adultery is still adultery , murder is still murder , stealing is still stealing , etc ... ..
Thompson ignores a second important distinction . In the violinist illustration , the woman might be justified withholding life-giving treatment from the musician under these circumstances . Abortion , though , is not merely withholding treatment . It is actively taking another human being 's life through poisoning or dismemberment . A more accurate parallel with abortion would be to crush the violinist or cut him into pieces before unplugging him .

What in your mind is the difference between civil unions and marriage ? I read where several people , VOR being one of them , are opposed to gay marriage but support civil unions . If it is just the name then should n't we just change the name of all marriage licenses to civil unions ? It is a lot like saying you like lemon juice but hate lemon squeezeings .
Yeah , it is a good first step though . While they should have allowed gays to get married , it is progress , but they will eventually find out that seperate but equal will not work .
Dear Chloe , Do you really want women tried for murder because they decide to take a pill that will cause an abortion ? That is the only logical position a court can take once a zygote , embryo and fetus are legislated into the status of Human Beings . If one kills a human being , one is guilty of murder .
Actually , it 's not a good point . I usually question the maturity of people who judge other people by where they were born and raised . There are good things about every state .

We thought that the idea itself was important , that this is a really powerful approach to a very major question ,  said Funk , but we thought there was no way in the world that we were actually going to get statistically significant results. The reason for his doubt was the incompleteness and lack of uniformity of ecological data . There are all these species out there and so few of them are known in intimate detail , so any kind of ecological characterization  through no fault of ecologists  will be limited in accuracy and precision ,  Funk said .

Your selective memory is at work again . As I recall , in Waco military vehicles and equipment were used against the Branch Davidians . Nevermind the presence of members of Delta Force which was denied , at first , by the government . Then they were caught lying again about using flammable tear gas which , ironically enough , is banned by the Geneva Convention for use against enemy troops . In the end , the 'open and shut case ' the government thought they had , blew up in their faces because of their lies and abuses . I also recall , at some point around the time of the Great Depression that U.S. troops were called out to quell food riots in New York , I think it was . There were a couple of young officers present by the name of MacArthur and Patton , I believe . There are a few other instances I 'm sure .

It is very clear to me what is to be done with non-patriots and gun haters . You tolerate them . There is no other choice in a democracy .

Okay , you miss interperted what I ment when I said the baby did not do anything ... .I didnt mean for it to sound like the mother did . Just because the baby is a product of rape does not mean it is a `` evil '' baby . Give it up for adoption . And when I said one life would have to end that would be the choice of the mother ... .there are exceptions to every law . Even though it is legal to kill a fetus doesnt make it right
No , you do n't want to do that , you might have to post something relevant ! What the selected quotes in the counterblast against the monstrous regiment of enlightenment have in common is a maximum magazine size of ten rounds . Is it unreasonable to expect that even a barely competent marksman might manage to hit their target before running out of ammo ? The inconvenience of losing a few seconds of blasting time might make a life and death difference to the innocent victims if the targets are human , and said blaster has to pause to reload .

I fear that would lead to extermination of the women .
You simply must understand they do not see reason or they would be on our side . There are only 2 kinds of people who hate guns . 1 ) Liberty and Freedom haters who want the government to control every part of their lives . 2 ) Criminals set on harming the innocent and defenceless .
If you want a contradiction how about conservatives who are against abortion , but advocate the death penalty , Who think nothing of sending their sons and daughters off to die in war with someone who was not a real threat and call it patriotism . Who , with one hand , sell the very weapons they condemn with the other . That is your real contradiction
I have no problem with either of these . Let freedom ring
Yes , socialist . Check the definition . I do n't watch Fox . Is that the best you can do ?
Finish the other threads in which you 're being crushed before moving onto another .
Not many women would say they had an abortion now , let alone back when it was illegal . It is an emotionally trying event . I can understand why she would n't for that reason alone . Another possibility is that the Administration is buying her silence , or it could be a combination of the two .
At what cost ? How many civil rights are you willing to give up in the name of a few less murders each year ? Are you perfectly willing to be stopped by the police on a block-by-block basis and forced to show identification and traveling papers , all the while the officers on location are pointing their guns right at your head , ready to blow you away at the first sign of a twitch or if you display even a hint of hesitation to comply ? How desperately do you crave a police state ? How much do you favor a nationwide curfew where violators can be arrested by the police and held without legal counsel for an indefinite period of time ? Do you favor the use of physical and mental torture to force convictions even from the innocent ?
if the laws of logic are human constructs then how can they be absolute since humans think differently and often contradictorily .

So with that , its also pretty easy to imagine that there was no NEED for the human genome to mutate to accommodate a fruitless/vitaminC-less diet . Likewise , we also know that primates also consume a diet high in fruits , leaves and berries , thereby getting plenty of vitamin C. So like humans , primates would have no reason for their genomes to mutate if they ate fruits and leaves high in vitamin C from the beginning .

As of today , 11-08-04 , the Cobb County ( GA ) school system is being tested in court about the validity of their warning sticker pasted in every Evolution textbook . The sticker basically says that evolution is a theory and should be approached with an open mind .

This is the same school system whose leader recently tried to have the word `` evolution '' deleted from the school curriculum . Is the Bible Belt getting too tight ?

# 1 See the post titled `` Biblical Failures '' in the Religion section of this forum . If the Bible has a single inaccuracy in it , then it can not be considered 100 % true . This post shows inaccuracies so the Bible can not be considered a reliable source for things that can not be proven and that includes trying to say whether an unborn baby has a soul . Besides , why should you be able to force your beliefs on everyone else ? Perhaps you could justify a law that says all Christians can not have abortions .

I beg to differ . If you read Mark 10:6-9 , it explains that a man and woman are made for each other and if a man puts his wife away and marries another , it is adultry . If this man was a preacher , it looks like he would show where the Bible says that a woman and woman should get married in order to condone same sex marriages .
PENNSYLVANIA CONSTITUTION Section 21 . Right to Bear Arms The right of the citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State shall not be questioned . I do n't see the word `` qualified '' in there .
Good point Linus Also your whole idea of `` God '' is a beleif , and therfore really doesnt hold much of an argument . Thats why its not a main point in a abortion debate . Facts cant really present themselves of wether God is real . Thats all religious opinion .
The concept of evolution was recently founded at that time , and some closed minded religious people were afraid of it , and vehemently opposed having it taught in schools . Today , the concept of intelligent design , ( void of any certain religion and its associated faith ) is vehemently opposed by closed minded Darwinists , who are afraid of it in exactly the same way . I suspect the same thing was at the root of it all 100 years ago just like today - concerns of how the money flows . Religious leaders seek funding - secular science seeks funding .
I think the argument that a woman has the right to determine what is done with her bodily resources during pregnancy lacks justification . For those who do : Do you assume that this is an absolute right and the moral good at any time and in every circumstance ( even before the 14th amendment existed and even in countries where it does not apply ) ? Do you agree that breast milk is a bodily resource of the mother ? If the answers to these questions are yes : Imagine a time when artificial formula did not exist . According to this reasoning it would be legitimate for a woman who suddenly decided she did not want to donate her bodily resources to withhold nutrition until the infant died . In fact , she should be able to dispose of that tissue some call infants through any of the same means as done in abortions ( that would be sticking scissors in the head , burning , ect ) . Infanticide would be a moral option for any woman who does not wish to donate bodily fluids to her newborn parasite and does not have access to formula at any moment because of various reasons . I am sure there are women in the world today who do not have access to formula . Are these women justified in deeming these babies as life unworthy of life and disposing of them ?

This is why I oppose evolution even though I may not understand it fully . Evolution is only around because those who created evolution created it as a rejection of the God that I serve and as it were the idea that all of creation shared before Darwin came along .
Not all of them .
Well , we are now about 120 years after Darwin and the knowledge of the fossil record has been greatly expanded . We now have a quarter of a million fossil species but the situation has n't changed much . The record of evolution is still surprisingly jerky and , ironically , we have even fewer examples of evolutionary transition than we had in Darwin 's time . By this I mean that some of the classic cases of darwinian change in the fossil record , such as the evolution of the horse in North America , have had to be discarded or modified as a result of more detailed information -- what appeared to be a nice simple progression when relatively few data were available now appears to be much more complex and much less gradualistic . So Darwin 's problem has not been alleviated in the last 120 years and we still have a record which does show change but one that can hardly be looked upon as the most reasonable consequence of natural selection . Also the major extinctions such as those of the dinosaurs and trilobites are still very puzzling . ( http : //www.geocities.com/osarsif/ce01.htm )

`` Pro-Gun '' States Lead the Nation in Per Capita Firearm Death Rates Violence Policy Center Analysis of New Data Reveals : Louisiana , Alaska , Montana , Tennessee , and Alabama Top List of Deadliest States in the Nation Blind Allegiance to the Second Amendment Takes Deadly Toll Washington , DC & # 8212 ; States in the South and West with weak gun laws and high rates of gun ownership lead the nation in overall firearm death rates according to a new analysis issued today by the Violence Policy Center ( VPC ) of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) data . The new VPC analysis uses 2005 data ( the most recent available ) from the CDC 's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control . The analysis reveals that the five states with the highest per capita gun death rates were Louisiana , Alaska , Montana , Tennessee and Alabama . Each of these states had a per capita gun death rate far exceeding the national per capita gun death rate of 10.32 per 100,000 . By contrast , states with strong gun laws and low rates of gun ownership had far lower rates of firearm-related death . Ranking last in the nation for gun death was Hawaii , followed by Massachusetts , Rhode Island , New Jersey and New York . ( See chart below for top and bottom five states . See http : //www.vpc.org/fadeathchart.htm for a ranking of all 50 states . ) http : //vpc.org/press/0804gundeath.htm So how do the people who claim guns save lives explain this ?
Nice try , but no cigar . It 's been widely reported , even on liberal-run media , that states with 'conceal carry laws ' have had a reduction in overall crime and more dramatic reductions in specific crimes like murder , etc . Myself , I do n't worry with providing 'raw data ' for lazy liberals who wo n't be swayed in their rabid hatred of 'gun ownership ' anyway . Just keep believing Sarah Brady and the rest of those fools . However , you might want to read some of John Lott 's stuff : http : //www.johnrlott.com/ http : //www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/493636.html
So are pro-gun activists not so different than gay rights activists ?
For example her fetus may have a sex linked disease or have a high risk of same if its male . What would you say if it turned out that male homosexuality was maternally inherited ? If it were and there was a history of males in your family being homosexual , would you consider aborting a male fetus and trying to have a daughter instead ?
Atheists may not believe even though you open the gates of heaven for them and they saw the angels with their own eyes ; they are like the smoker who smokes cigarettes in spite of that he knows that cigarettes are harmful .
Even if the number of defensive uses is only 800,000 a year , that 's still a rate of more than 53 to 1 when compared to the number of homicides committed with a firearm . Kleck was a supporter of the anti-gun position . But then he decided to go and commit the ultimate sin that a liberal could : he began to think in a logical and questioning manner . If he could learn the error of his ways , why ca n't you ? Even if the number of defensive uses is only 100,000 that 's still more than 6 to 1 when compared to the number of people murdered every year .
One of these aspects of existence which we arbitarily believe in is cause and effect . Another is the external world . A third is the consciousness of others . A fourth is the past etc . etc .

Gun Laws of America is 384 pages of just the federal statutes that regulate gunsmore than 88,000 words . Additionally , the associated federal regulations interpreting these laws are even larger . Minimum penalty for a violation is typically 5 years in federal prison for every offense . It is estimated that there are between 22,000 and 30,000 gun laws on the books in America . Those laws include restrictions on possession , carry , distribution , storage , transfer , manufacture , sale , ownership , importation , use and more .
Galalieo lets just say you get rid of all guns in citizens hands . Who will protect the citizens as in the Heller case the supreme court ruled that it is not the responsiblitity of the police to protect the citizens . My question to you is who will ?
my opinion , their banning a gun because of the way it looks they seem to think an ak47 is worse than a regular gun because it looks like a military gun the only true ( assault weapon ) is fully automatic i have . sereral ak47s but their semi -auto thats not an assault weapon !
My article was about the banning of swords in Australia . Another step in the tyrranicle overstepping of power by a government over its people .

Once again , this shows the true colors of liberals . Oh they 'll scream `` tolerance '' and `` acceptance '' when it relates to them or their causes . But whenever conservatives speak up , to quote Rush : `` Racist , Sexist , Bigot , Homophobe '' are the standard fare that is heard .
Donna Santa Marie was a 16-year-old girl who was forced by her parents and abortionist to have an abortion against her will . Her father even punched her in the stomach to try to induce a miscarriage . The abortionist had to be called in to perform an abortion without her consent . Despite these horrific facts , New Jersey Federal Courts have ruled that Donna Santa Marie can not sue the doctor , the abortionist , because the infant was not born alive and have cited Roe v. Wade as justification . If Roe v. Wade is supposed to be based on a woman 's choice , how can she be forced to have an abortion and have no remedy under the law .
also they did n't seem to mind that the abortion rate which was declining under clinton has been raising under Bush ... maybe they 're not that bothered .

This statement is wrong . People from hundreds of years before Jesus was born prophesied that a baby would be born , in Bethlehem , of a virgin . There were over 50 more prophesies that were made about his life , and the sacrafice he made to pay for the sins of man , and the bigest one of all ... He completely fufilled scripture when he rose from the dead . These men were inspired by Jesus , God , how can you argue that he is not the christ ? The odds of one man filling all the prophesies is impossible . And these scriptures have been unchanged for the past 2000-2500 approx years ! Thats proof for me that Jesus existed and that he is God . PM me if you like .

SACRAMENTO  A bill that would ban the public display of unloaded guns narrowly passed the Senate Public Safety Committee Tuesday . The 4-3 vote sent the legislation carried by Assemblywoman Lori Saldaña , D-San Diego , to the Appropriations Committee and likely on to the Senate floor where the final outcome is in doubt , particularly in this election-year atmosphere . The measure has passed the Assembly earlier this month . California law currently allows unloaded handguns to be carried in public . Saldañas measure , Assembly Bill 1934 , is supported by a statewide police chiefs organization and major gun-control groups . They argue that police are being required to respond to reports of guns , draining resources and creating dangerous situations because authorities have to assume the guns are loaded . This open carry movement goes beyond whats safe and whats responsible ,  Saldaña said . Emeryville Police Chief Ken James added , Open carry is not just a threat to public safety , its a threat to officers. Several opponents of the measure countered that they have a constitutional right to bear arms and noted that there have been no police problems directly associated with someone carrying an unloaded weapon in plain sight . Some also contend the legislation would make criminals out of hunters , campers and others who take their weapons along for protection and target shooting . Sen. Rod Wright , D-Inglewood , and a gun owner , defended the right to carry weapons in public as long as they are unloaded . Responding to complaints that the guns intimidate and make people uncomfortable , Wright said he has a tall friend with tattoos who intimidates and makes people uncomfortable . Are we going to ban him next ?  Wright asked as he voted against the bill . But Sen. Gil Cedillo , D-Los Angeles , said that it is too dangerous to allow gang-bangers to openly tote weapons . There are Second Amendment rights ,  he said . There are also Second Amendment responsibilities ,  Cedillo said .

This is the argument concerning 'choice ' that , to me , rings untrue and is a potential weak point . The whole 'when does life begin/when is it human ? ' is n't where those that favor woman 's rights should stake their claim . I support a woman 's right to control her body and I feel that one of the best ways to 'judge ' a culture is to see how they treat women . I think that it is imperative to allow a women to control her body , regardless of when life begins , etc ... Now I also abhor abortions and I extol responsibility . However , # $ % ( happens and a woman MUST be able to retain the ability to decide what to do in the event of an unexpected pregnancy . Now , considering responsibility important , I can understand and appreciate time limits and whatnot , because that is humane . But we should call a spade a spade ... a fetus is or will be human and an abortion does 'kill ' it . Its horrible that it happens , but we have to allow women that right .
If they 're voting then they should be paying taxes too . There 's no excuse for those lazy stiffs to avoid being miserable along with everybody else . Nobody ever said that taxes had to stop just because you do .

BEREGA , Tanzania  A handwritten ledger at the hospital tells a grim story . For the month of January , 17 of the 31 minor surgical procedures here were done to repair the results of incomplete abortions. A few may have been miscarriages , but most were botched operations by untrained , clumsy hands . Abortion is illegal in Tanzania ( except to save the mothers life or health ) , so women and girls turn to amateurs , who may dose them with herbs or other concoctions , pummel their bellies or insert objects vaginally . Infections , bleeding and punctures of the uterus or bowel can result , and can be fatal . Doctors treating women after these bungled attempts sometimes have no choice but to remove the uterus . Pregnancy and childbirth are among the greatest dangers that women face in Africa , which has the worlds highest rates of maternal mortality  at least 100 times those in developed countries . Abortion accounts for a significant part of the death toll .

Because they could n't own models like the AR-15 or AK-47 ? Last I checked those were banned in Chicago and much of Illinois , limiting people to mainly deer rifles . Whatever you read is irrelevant . In Heller the judges ruled it was illegal and unconstitutional to ban ownership of an entire class of firearms , such as handguns . In McDonald they extended that same standard to all 50 states . Gun control makes crime worse . Look at how many murders Chicago admitted they experienced each year that involved handguns . Nearly all of them .
Organs , a nervious system , a brain , all these are the things that make us human . Those things are not developed until 7-10 weeks after conception though ( depending on your source ) . Many like to show proof that they start to develope earlier but again , unless something is completed and is operating then it can not be regarded as developed . Based on that information I would have to say that abortion should be legal until 7-10 weeks after conception . Once that time period has passed and the fetus has a functional nervious system and brain then abortion should only be reserved for the rare cases that the mothers life is in danger .
Sandy , When they talk about the distance , they are talking about the distance as related to time through lightyears .

Why do you assume the poster did n't use birth control ?
Sounds like a fact which has been blown out of all proportion - possibly by the pro-gun side attempting to ridicule it .

1 ) The need to display current information . This article is almost four years old , I have yet to hear anything about this over the entire course of Mr. Bush 's presidency . George W. Bush is one of the most personally assaulted Presidents in US history , few will argue this whether they support him or not . Just about every negative thing Bush has been involved in or people speculate he was involved in has been dragged out and there any number of books with the details . This info has had little or no further data in the past 4 years . The press loves a scandal and I have yet to see them shy away from one as juicy as this if it were true .
If all marriage was illegal , would that violate civil rights ? No . It would be a denial of a different right , the right to be free of oppressive laws that would destroy society - but that right is not unique to marriage .

http : //www.sciencedaily.com/releases ... 0220072315.htm Scientists have long believed that bacteria in the intestines , known as Bacteroides , could exchange genetic information .

Biologists , despite the evidence , have refused to acknowledge that we are all wholes  they see us only as an accumulation of parts .

Sawn-off shotguns are still the weapon of choice for the more serious armed criminal and can now be bought illegally for between £50 and £200 , according to Home Office research . A purpose-built 9mm handgun , which is easier to conceal than a shotgun , is available for £1,000-£1,400 on the back streets of Britain while those wanting `` a gangster image '' can buy a machine gun for £800 . Even though those interviewed were in prison , many still viewed gun crime as a `` viable career option '' enabling them to overcome their deprived backgrounds to secure wealth and status . One man from Greater Manchester claimed he had earned £52,000 in a week from gun crime . The study shows that though Nottingham is dubbed Britain 's gun crime capital , guns are far more available in Manchester , Liverpool , Birmingham and London .
By Reduction to the Absurd : Suppose that God is in fact all-powerful . If he is all-powerful , then he can do anything . Yet this raises the question , `` If God can do anything , can he make a rock so hard that he himself can not break it ? '' If the answer is yes , then God can not break this rock , so there is something he can not do . If the answer is no , then he can not make such a rock , and thus there is also something he can not do . Therefore , it is impossible that God can do everything , and it is thus impossible for him to be all powerful . I ca n't claim originality for this proof , but I have never heard any good refutation of it , and yet people still act as if God is all powerful despite the absurdity of such a notion . If there is a refutation , then I 'd like to hear it .
`` Hendrik Poinar of McMaster University in Hamilton , Ontario , cautions that looks can deceive : Nucleated protozoan cells have been found in 225-million-year-old amber , but geochemical tests revealed that the nuclei had been replaced with resin compounds .

Flexible fossils of colonial marine organisms called graptolites have been recovered from 440-million-year-old rocks , but the original material -- likely collagen -- had not survived . ''
Can individuals adapt ? Of course : I can duck when I enter a room with a low ceiling . My retinas contract to adapt my vision to bright light . I can also build red muscle by doing anerobic exercise , and white muscle by doing aerobic exercise ; all these are ways in which my body can adapt to demands placed upon it . Now , if underneath all this the genome was rock-solid and invariant , you would be correct : organisms would adapt epigenetically and that would be the end of it . However , genetic variation does occur . And once you admit the possibility of genetic variation , the genomic gaps between species cease to be an insurmountable problem for evolution : we can envisage that gap narrowing as we move back in time to a point where two species were one . Genetic adaptation , unlike epigenetic adaptation , does not lie within the individual ; it is distributed across the gene-pool . Mating produces new combinations , and selective environments can enable some combinations to flourish better than others , even once volitional and epigenetic adaptation is taken into account . It 's a mistake to characterise the ToE as being only about RM+NS . Even just in terms of genes , recombination through breeding is very important . But genetic variation does require an explanation , as does the remarkable correlation between the genetic and phylogenetic trees and the fossil record . Besides , genetic adaptation is observed to occur . So far , there 's no evidence that the direction genetic variation takes is under the control of the organism - whatever other adaptive tools might be at its disposal . Thus Lamarckism , which postulates a seamless end-to-end mechanism explaining all adaptation , fails to correlate with reality .
.and that 's because the medical establishment has made it illegal to treat any disease in this country with anything other than FDA approved drugs or surgery . It 's all about the money , man .

What organsims inherit is not simply genes , but a complex organization called the living state that is capable of generating ( reproduction ) and regeneration because of intrinsic properties ascribed to field behavior What is reproduced in each generation is an entitiy with a potential set of forms out of which emerges a specific morphology as a result of external and internal particulars , among which are included are genes . The molecular composition of something is not , in general , sufficient to determine its form . The morphology of organisms can not be explained by the action of their genes .

Should it be legalized ? Absolutely not . Is it harmful ? Excessively . Should it be taxed once legalized ? Heavily ; at least five times what the purchase price is . Should laws still aply to it , such as DUIs and the like ? Without question .
Assault weapons ? first of all , what are assault weapons ? Traditionally , it has meant a selective fire weapon ( one capable of full , burst , and semi-automatic fire . ) According to current legal definition , though , a semiautomatic weapon ( one that fires a single round with every time you pull the trigger ) can be legally called an assault weapon if it has 1 ) a removeable magazine , and any 2 of the following : a grenade launcher a bayonet lug a pistol grip or a folding stock . How is that an assault weapon ? ? I have no idea ! why are they worried about semi-autos with pistol grips and folding stocks ? Again , I have no idea . However , we 'll assume for the moment that we are talking about a traditional assault rifle : a selective fire weapon along the lines of the FN FAL , the M16 , AK-47 , etc . Constitutionally , it does n't even really matter . In the United States Constitution , we are guaranteed in the 2nd Amendment that : `` ... the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed . '' There 's a key word there . `` Infringed . '' What does that word infringed mean ? Webster 's 1828 Dictionary defines it like this : 2 . To break ; to violate ; to transgress ; to neglect to fulfill or obey ; as to infringe the law . 3. to destroy or hinder ; as , to infringe efficacy . Under this definition , the right to own a firearm can not even be hindered ! Forget banning handguns . Forget banning assault weapons . The registration of firearms might not survive a Constitutional attack . So . It is UNCONSTITUTIONAL to ban assault weapons . ( despite the fact that we basically have already done that . )

During closing arguments on Friday morning , Mr. Roeder sat silent and expressionless as prosecutors portrayed the shooting of Dr. Tiller at his church on May 31 as not just premeditated murder but as a planned assassination that had been proven not only beyond a reasonable doubt but beyond any doubt. He claims justification ,  Kim Parker , a prosecutor said , calling on jurors here to uphold the law , not Mr. Roeders views of abortion , which , she said , he had proudly trumpeted on the witness stand . These are not the acts of a justified man . These acts are cowardly. ... . Yes , he bought a gun . Yes , he took target practice . Yes , he had learned about Dr. Tillers habits , his home address , his security precautions . And , yes , he shot Dr. Tiller last May 31 as Dr. Tiller stood inside his church . That is correct , yes ,  Mr. Roeder told the jurors , in a calm .

Do you prefer actually having to make personal moral choices or do you need a rigid and inviolable instruction manual to run your life ?
Now yes i agree with the death penalty as written by law and placed into law by those we entrust our laws too , that is what you vote for after all.This as nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that i believe that a woman should have the choice to abort or carry to full term.What about if the child will live for four weeks in terrible pain , should that child be born , a bit inhumane do you not agree ? .
That does n't sound silly to me .
Sorry I 'm just trying to learn more .
The difference is where you feel you can demand accountability . I think pro-life people who accept an exception in the case of incest and rape do n't view the child as less precious , they simply do n't feel the mother has the same accountability as she did not consent to the pregnancy . ( Granted , there are misogynistic lifers those who want to hold women as slaves to any and all pregnancies that come along ... ) I really do n't think the big pro-life vs pro-choice argument is about where life begins or whether or not life is precious . It 's more a debate over 1 - whether the rights of mother or the child take precedence , 2 - how much accountability can we hold a pregnanct woman to .
Lets see ... Christianity : a religious person who believes Jesus is the Christ and who is a member of a Christian denomination Now tell me , how can one say they are a Christian if they do n't follow his Word ?

I am not asking for the church or any religion to endorse , for lack of a better word , a gay marriage . What I am asking for is civil rights . The same rights any other couple receive under the law . Religion has nothing to do with it . As far as understanding , it really is not difficult . I am not heterosexual , however I understand and accept heterosexuality . If those who oppose or do n't understand could accept that fact the homosexuality is something one is born with and not something that one chooses , maybe it would make more sense to them . Me trying to explain to you why I am homosexual would be like you trying to explain to me why you are heterosexual . Homosexuals no more chose to be homosexual any more than an african american chose the color or their skin . Just look at your own life , your own desires , your own sexuality as it developed and evolved throughout your life . There is no difference other than mine are not towards the opposite sex , but otherwise exactly the same .

I would expect nothing less from the women in my life . They 've been raised with a different value system , evidently . My wife threw up every morning before going to work when she was pregnant and still managed to work and have 2 more children afterwards . And when she got large with the first one , she lost her job as the youngest assistant regional manager for a major young women 's chain because she did n't portray the look that they were promoting . We took it in stride and sacrificed to make ends meet since I had just graduated and was starting out as a chemist ... ..but we did the right thing .

No , this is not about abortion , and I think that is very clear . If I wanted to discuss abortion , then I would mosey on along to the abortion forum and post there . The point about abortion that I brought up is that it questions the premise offered by thelmoose with respect to juvenile development . In fact , this point was made in the dissent of a Supreme Court opinion dealing with executing juvenile offenders . On the one hand , it is argued that juveniles do posses enough moral maturity to be able to have the same right to abortion as an adult , but on the other hand , it is argued that they do not posses enough moral maturity to be able to be held to the same standard as adults when it comes to the decision to commit cold blooded murder . For your convenience , I underlined the key parts . We have here two contradictory statements . That is what I was pointing out .
Frankly , I think it 's about the only meaningful answer there is . Dawkins has famously said that ToE made atheism an intellectually defensible position , and he has a point . But it does n't make it an intellectually mandatory one .
I see no legal use handguns can fulfil
... This is the exact same mindset as the killer . He believed the doctor was deserving of death for his actions . The only difference is you have the shield of the law to hide behind . I imagine you would see his execution as justice . At the end of the day , the thinking is exactly the same .
It would appear that it is the Brits , rather than the Gun Nuts who claim that when guns are banned people will just use knives instead . Apparently they have moved beyond knives and are simply using whatever tool is available to commit violent crime . They are succeeding at a rate nearly 5 times that of the US `` gun culture '' .

Where is this type of abortion commonly done ? Once they have finished `` ripping '' the unborn ( abortion is n't very relevant once born ) fetus from the womb what do they do with it ? What do you suppose the primary reason for waiting until until the baby is crowning to abort ? Seems odd to go thru 9 months and labor to change one 's mind .
Seven thousand two hundred thirty-four . If Chicago is your home , that number tells you something about your city , and police say it 's not necessarily good . As CBS 2 's Kristyn Hartman reports , there have been 7,234 guns recovered or confiscated by Chicago Police so far this year . When you think about it , that 's about one gun for every 400 people , in a city with an ordinance that prohibits them . Chicagoan Robert Herbert hears gunshots all the time in his neighborhood . He says lots of people have them . `` All the time , every day , yesterday , the day before yesterday , '' Herbert said . Police are finding some of the guns . `` So far year to date , there 's been seven thousand , two hundred and thirty four firearms recovered in Chicago , '' said Deputy Chicago Police Chief Nick Roti . Roti says the number , which is up , really tells the tale of two cities . One is the mean streets story . `` Guns are found in parks , under porches , '' Roti said . The other is the safer streets story . `` The good news is we 're recovering the guns , '' he said . `` I think people are getting fed up with public violence , It 's evidenced by reporting of it . '' Roti says increased search warrants net guns . Buybacks , patrol stops and putting cops in the right places also net guns . Police say most of what they recover comes from south of the Stevenson Expressway , generally the South Side of Chicago , in neighborhoods like Englewood . There , gangs , drugs and firearms all seem to go together . Herbert is happy with the work , but he fears the guns are replaced as quickly as they are removed . If it were legal , he says he 'd have one for protection . When asked if there is a justification for carrying a weapon , Roti said : `` Not really for me to say . It 's against the law in Chicago . '' National Rifle Association Legislative Liaison Todd Vandermyde said if people were allowed to have a weapon for self-defense , it would `` absolutely '' deter crime . `` But Chicago has put its citizens in victimization mode , because they have n't allowed them the use of self-defense , '' he said . `` The only guys carrying guns on the streets are the bad guys . '' The city 's 27-year-old handgun ban is under court challenge . Meanwhile , police hope to challenge street violence with a provision waiting for Gov . Pat Quinn 's signature . It would mean gang members caught with guns would spend a mandatory three years behind bars . The ordinance would be named after Alex Valadez , a Chicago Police Officer who was killed .
But psychologically speaking , a first trimester fetus is not a being since it lacks sentience . DNA is all it takes to confirm that something is human ; like your fingernail pairings .
That depends on the circumstances . Only she can know .
I think you fail to take into account that for most opposers of abortion , they genuinely feel they are trying to save lives by their opposition . In many cases it 's not a matter of trying control sexual prermissiveness in society but preventing lives from being killed . Disagree or not , you ca n't separate the anti-abortion message from the fact that it holds to the view that abortion is a form of murder .
But the point you miss is that a caterpillar is NOT a butterfly ; a puppy is NOT a full grown dog ; a ZYGOTE and a FETUS are NOT children .
... and Genesis 2 is what was passed down through Noah , in Oral history , so it would differ slightly , but that 's becaue of man 's error , not God 's .
No , God did n't say this BUT thanks for responding to a post that is over 5 years old .
The Bible says that God created every thing in 6 days . That does not neccensaraly mean it only took 6 days . The meaning of the word `` day '' in the language the Bible was written in means basicly `` a long period of time '' . That would explain why some fossils are millions of years old . That does not how ever prove evolution .
Alot of children endure harassment because of living in a house made up of parents of the same sex . Just because it did not happen to your son , dose not mean that it dose not happen .
I would say no ... ... .I mean if you can believe in God , the you must believe that He 's going to put what he means in the Bible . `` He formed us from the dust of the earth ... . '' Why would n't He put something else , like we evolved ... .do n't argue that they would n't be able to comprehend that kind of science back then because you are limiting the ability of God ... ... .
I do n't think coverage is the government 's responsibility either . Rather , health care . Let the health insurance industry fend for itself , and find new and more constructive avenues for its capital , as we open up Medicare for ALL .
I have never heard anyone use the phrase , `` I am a human '' . Rights afforded born people need not descend from religiously inspired `` belief systems '' . Your belief that a fetus deserves the same rights as fully developed people does . In fact all your arguments always flow from this presumption .
That is an incorrect statement . Viability seems to be the topic that gets little mention here . Humanity , consciousness , personhood , sentience , etc . are all extremely debatable , as has been demonstrated , sometimes ad nauseam .
anybody heard that the city of san fransisco is talking about banning the ownership of guns by anybody other than police in the city limits . if so , how true is it and how do you think it will stand up to the constitution ?
It ca n't come up with evidence if it 's suppressed from future generations . Until you can show that happenstance origins are science , you have no basis to declare that intelligent design is not science . I agree that I have n't shown how ID has a potential advantage to the political corruptness of today 's scientific community , but I 've shown it 's potential advantage to our society . I 've shown how thinking is involved with it , the type of thinking involved in any school class involving philosophy , which you said science classes should have .
okay , well i think that you are just finding reasons to go against Him . I think that you had some bad experiances when you were younger or a while ago that made you turn on God . You are looking for reasons , not very good ones i might add , to convince people ... ..either way , God loves you .
Have you guys checked out the link to Dr. Dino ( www.drdino.com ) that BP posted ? I was looking around in there , and I have to say , I was incredulous . At first I could n't get past the thought that this must be a really well orchestrated hoax , but it just is n't . I then actually became kind of angry . It 's so dishonest and down right wrong IMHO to mislead people like that , and not only do they mislead them , but they do it with an absolute tone of authority and righteousness . On top of that , they present it as well researched `` science '' , when in fact the entire purpose of the site is to `` refute '' science . They take advangtage of not only people 's faith , but of their ignorance as well . Finally , I left the site almost kind of feeling sorry for `` Dr. '' Hovind and his believers . I think it 's sad that people who are obviously intelligent have to distort reality like they do in order to justify their faith . I also think it 's sad that these people have such a strong influence over so many people , people that are easily manipulated by Hovind and others due to a lack of any real knowledge or understanding of the subject . I think the saddest part is , that people actually believe the stuff on this site , for whatever reason . How weak must your faith be that you have go to the lengths that Hovind does in order to justify it ? Waxy
The irony is that we all fall somewhere on the line of pregnancy from no abortions at all to minutes before birth .

So should people also look for more neucleotides and more planets within Mercury 's orbit ? The list of things that people could look for goes on and on .

My mom can only trace her family back a few generations . By the time we get to the clan that lived in Ohio in the middle of the 19th century , the records get very confusing and very incomplete .

There is definitely a controversy between whether or not Global Warming is happening or not . I know that where I live , the year-round temperature is actually getting colder !

It is my understanding that the number of states that have amendments banning same-sex marriage is now at 19 . Even California is working on it . The number of states that have laws that ban it is 33 . ( Maybe more now ; that number was from early 2004 ) I think gay 'rights ' lobbyists would do well to start realizing that marriage really matters a lot to the majority of people in this country , and to realize that they are treading on an institution that is traditionally and fundamentally opposite-sex by nature and definition . The number of states not allowing gay marriage is on the rise dramatically , since gay activists began pushing things so strongly in the last few years . The more gay people push to redefine marriage , the harder they are going to make it for themselves .
1 ) Nitpicking . The movie was n't attempting to link euginics and the holocaust to Darwin himself nearly as much as it was showing its relationship with Darwinism in general .
What puzzles me is that Gun control advocates will not change their unrealistic ideas when presented the facts . It did n't work in DC , it did n't work in the UK . Look at the crime rate in DC versus Indianapolis . All evidence points to the failure of gun control . Heck , in the UK cops used to only carry clubs , now they carry guns , body armour , and are not allowed to patrol alone . Real safe .
Therefore , it is obvious that this scenario indicates that Africans ( Blacks ) , due to the fact that they started evolving later than Europeans and Asians , are almost 400,000 years behind these other groups in evolutionary standards . Thus , they got a late start !
The Bible even suggests that all Christians have a duty to go and spread the word and attempt to convert others to Christianity . I do n't believe any other religion has such a following that will work so tirelessly to try and convert the entire world to their view point .

It was the year 1909 and a navy officer ( who was a Humanist ) decided to search for the North Pole . He brought along a Biologist for research and a Priest just for moral support . While trekking through the middle of no-where they stumble across an igloo . The Priest exclaims : `` it 's a miracle ! '' The Humanist dismisses it saying : `` do n't be silly , man must have made it '' Then the biologist pipes up : `` wait a minute '' After jotting down notes and referring to his books for about an hour he says : `` yes , after scientifically analyzing the facts it 's obvious to me that over a period of about 1000 years this snow shelter evolved ''

So Galileo . I shared your post and link with the Author of gunlaws.com / Bloomfield Press Alan Korwin , and he said I could share this , and any reply he gets with you guys . To Jon S. Vernick ; Lisa M. Hepburn A friend sent me a link to your paper on gun-law counts . http : //www.brookings.edu/es/urban/pu ... s/gunbook4.pdf Your finding of approximately 300 major state gun laws appears to be incorrect . California alone has 541 numbered statutes of gun law , twice what the federal government has passed . We publish the gun laws for several states , and distribute books on the subject for 24 states . Our definition for a gun law , while slightly different than yours , is close enough and guides our selection -- with a need to include no extraneous material that would increase the girth and cost of our books . If it affects private ownership , possession or use of firearms , it is included . A huge list of laws that are not included , which would raise the counts dramatically , is printed in the front of each of our books ( e.g. , regs for police , criminals , military , Native Americans , federal officials , etc . ; 55 numbered federal statutes deal solely with armed federal agents ) . Gun-law counts are somewhat preposterous though because , for example , a single law can regulate numerous disparate subjects . The Brady law , for example , with its 3,000 words , controls airline baggage , point-of-sale purchases , development and maintenance of an FBI computer gun-tracking system and much more . Counting it as `` one law '' would be hopelessly misleading if the goal is to determine how much gun law exists . For specifics , I can tell you affirmatively that at last count there were 271 numbered federal gun-controlling statutes ; Texas had 226 ; Arizona 183 ; Florida 229 ; and Virginia , in out just released 7th edition , has 193 . Your overall count of 300 would therefore seem to come up somewhat short , would n't you agree ? You 'll find background and and extended discussion of true counts here : gunlaws.com - FAQ The real question though is this : Is there any criminal gun-related activity that is not already banned ? The answer to that is no , and usually there are multiple bans for any nefarious activity you can imagine . New proposals invariable seek to criminalize possession by the public , possession which is perfectly lawful and harms no one , creating victimless crimes , and malum prohibitum laws that reduce freedom . That 's why new bills typically meet such stiff resistance . Is there a mechanism for you to amend your paper for Brookings ? It 's certainly in your best interests to have accurate information in the public domain with your names attached .
However , at some point the will of the majority should be respected . Otherwise we have no business even calling ourselves a democracy ( not that we technically are , but we at least fancy ourselves one ) .

What about a fat women ? Fat women are not as atractive as slimmer women , but bigger women tend to have much larger breasts , which is what most men go for .

Do you attempt to improve your collection by selling a firearm that another hobbyist wants and then reinvesting in the & # 8220 ; latest firearm or piece of gear & # 8221 ; found in your favorite gun magazine ? Have you ever had to liquidate some of your collection to finance a project that was very important to you or your family ? FBI Special Agent John Shipley has been indicted by a Federal Grand Jury in El Paso , Texas for buying and selling firearms without a license . What the government does not understand is that the personal sale of a firearm is NOT illegal . The Federal Firearms Regulations Reference Guide clearly states that a & # 8220 ; Dealer is defined as : & # 8220 ; ( c ) Dealer in firearms other than a gunsmith or a pawnbroker . A person who devotes time , attention , and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms , but such a term shall not include a person who makes occasional sales , exchanges , or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby , or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms. & # 8221 ; Since John & # 8217 ; s livelihood is as a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) his life is dedicated to upholding and enforcing the laws of the United States of America . His grandparents sparked his interest in firearms and had even contributed to his collection . But after qualifying for a SWAT team and becoming a sniper for the FBI , his interests and guns began to more closely line up with his needs and wants to become a firearms instructor for the FBI . In most cases , a crime is committed and justice searches for the person that committed the crime . But in this case , justice has found a person and they are searching for a crime to pin upon him . Having a personal collection of firearms , ammunition , and related items is NOT Illegal . Reading firearms magazines , belonging to a gun club and frequently going to the firing range is also NOT Illegal . Buying and selling guns to improve or enhance a personal collection or to even liquidate a part or all of a collection is NOT Illegal . So why is John Shipley being accused of selling firearms without a license , when a license is not required ? I guess we will have to watch this case very closely , because if an FBI Special Agent can be targeted , any gun enthusiast could be next !

I agree with you , that 's just plain silly . First of all we do n't know if a soul even exist , and secondly , even if we had proof that it did , we have no way of knowing when it becomes reality for that person . Maybe it 's like sin , you know , a man-made concept
and another ... In order to act as raw material only , variation must walk a tightrope between two unacceptable alternatives . first and foremost , variation must exist in sufficient amounts , for natural selection can make nothing , and must rely upon bounty thus provided ; but variation must not be too florid or showy either , lest it become the creative agent of change itself . Variation , in short , must be copious , small in extent , and undirected .

I could care less what gays want to do -- it 's their life , after all , but I find the wording of this really curious . How the heck is something like that to be `` sanctioned '' ? A token govt . policy ? Special recognition ? And I also find it odd that no one here ( so far ) is balking at the use of the term `` lifestyle '' by the article . Is the `` L '' word ok when it 's being used in an article giving news that gay people want to hear ?

From one of the cited papers : Third , while previous analyses suggest that the canonical code outperforms most alternatives , a comprehensive search of possible code structures suggests that far better alternatives are possible ( Wong 1980Citation ; DiGiulio 1989 , 1994Citation ; Goldman 1993Citation ) Early Fixation of an Optimal Genetic Code -- Freeland et al . 17 ( 4 ) : 511 -- Molecular Biology and Evolution That , and the fact that the genetic code varies a bit in some kingdoms , pretty much rules out the notion of an `` optimal code .

That 's incorrect . The Constitution begins with Article 1 which does not contain the Bill of Rights . The Constitution contains seven articles which are followed by the Bill of Rights and the rest of the amendments . If you really are from England as you claim then I guess your lack of knowledge about the American Constitution is understandable .
The militia of the Second Amendment is a militia that is described as being well regulated ( regulated by both the federal government and the states as spoken of in Article 1 of the Constitution ) . In our own day , I think the National Guard would be the only militia that qualifies as being well regulated . Alexander Hamilton spoke of the desirability of the militia being well regulated : `` It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects , whenever they were called into service for the public defense . It would enable them to discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army ; and it would fit them much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be essential to their usefulness . This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority . It is , therefore , with the most evident propriety , that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the Union `` to provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining the militia , and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States , RESERVING TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS , AND THE AUTHORITY OF TRAINING THE MILITIA ACCORDING TO THE DISCIPLINE PRESCRIBED BY CONGRESS . '' The Federalist Papers - THOMAS ( Library of Congress ) We could go back to the days when most citizens were required to enroll in the militia , have guns and get military training- to what the Founders really meant when they spoke of a well regulated militia being the security of a free state . But the Supreme Court along with pro-gun activists claiming to be pro- Second Amendment have decided to turn their back on that part of the Second Amendment while giving the lip service to the idea of a militia .

Nonsense . Almost a billion people are nonreligious .
The genetic code has the remarkable property of error minimization , whereby the arrangement of amino acids to codons is highly efficient at reducing the deleterious effects of random point mutations and transcriptional and translational errors . Whether this property has been explicitly selected for is unclear . Here , three scenarios of genetic code evolution are examined , and their effects on error minimization assessed . First , a simple model of random stepwise addition of physicochemically similar amino acids to the code is demonstrated to result in substantial error minimization . Second , a model of random addition of physicochemically similar amino acids in a codon expansion scheme derived from the Ambiguity Reduction Model results in improved error minimization over the first model . Finally , a recently introduced 213 Model of genetic code evolution is examined by the random addition of physicochemically similar amino acids to a primordial core of four amino acids . Under certain conditions , 22 % of the resulting codes produced according to the latter model possess equivalent or superior error minimization to the standard genetic code . These analyses demonstrate that a substantial proportion of error minimization is likely to have arisen neutrally , simply as a consequence of code expansion , facilitated by duplication of the genes encoding adaptor molecules and charging enzymes . This implies that selection is at best only partly responsible for the property of error minimization . These results caution against assuming that selection is responsible for every beneficial trait observed in living organisms .

I disagree with you because the logic you have used to prop up your assertion that your philosophy mirrors reality is clearly faulty .
Life is not chaotic it is orderly and requires replication . Without this you just have a lot of chemicals mixing in an infinite variety . The reason that life must be derived from life ( biogenesis ) in the minds of most is that this is the only way we have ever seen it happen . `` You can imagine anything you like but you can only understand the truth '' as Newton said . Now if amino acids are the mirror image of nucleic acid sugars and this in true of all living things then we are limited to this as fundamental to life . This in my opinion is the fundamental first step and it can not happen peicemeal , it all has to happen all at once .
Nah , it is a gateway in the fact that heroin addicts and crack addicts are in the same room and are the same friends of yours that supply the marijuana .
I disagree . If there were 500,000 gay couples in the US today that wanted to get married and Uncle Sam said `` OK '' , instantly , 500,000 people who 5 minutes before had zero legal standing and NO chance of gaining any benefits as a married partner , with respects to SS , Medicare , gov't pensions , tax breaks , etc. , suddenly become stakeholders . I 'd call that the creation of a new class of dependent . To argue otherwise is to be in denial .
No-one experiences the existence of an outside world . Explanations such as the Matrix can explain sense impressions as well as some concept of 'external reality ' . We have no more evidence for one than the other . The fact no-one takes them seriously is a psychological point about human beings , nothing to do with reality per se . How is that based on experience ? We have no data that says 'an outside world exists ' . The assumption that such a world exists is made before we can use the data . But the belief that 'its gotten us far ' is itself a 'scientific ' type belief , in fact it has less proof on the empirical assumptions than the science itself . Justifying the validity of experience by experience is the intellectual equivalent of saying 'God must exist , because God is good and would not allow a world without God ' .

If Prop . 8 is upheld , then I do n't see the point of having a Supreme Court with salaried positions . Any ruling it makes can be changed . People 's rights are only as good as their popularity at any given time . All rights are potentially as solid as sand as the tide moves in .
See , here is the example of how..out of touch you are . Of course it could be dangerous . I have not only been gay bashed once , but twice in my life . The first time coming out of a bar when I was in my early 20s . I was beaten by five guys with baseball bats . My head swelled 3 times it 's size and I was out cold for 4 days . I had `` nike '' imprinted into my skin from the bottom of their sneakers . The second time , I met a friend for dinner at a local bar . We met at about 7pm , had a drink and as we left the bar to go to a diner I was body slammed by two college kids running down the street . Broke my collar bone and was knocked out . When the owner of the bar came out he asked ... do you think this was a hate crime . We have been having some problems .

So what ? Most of them are still getting killed with guns . A Red Herring is a fallacy in which an irrelevant topic is presented in order to divert attention from the original issue . The basic idea is to `` win '' an argument by leading attention away from the argument and to another topic . This sort of `` reasoning '' has the following form : 1 . Topic A is under discussion . 2 . Topic B is introduced under the guise of being relevant to topic A ( when topic B is actually not relevant to topic A ) . 3 . Topic A is abandoned .

SPOKANE , Wash.  Authorities searched by air and land Friday for a criminally insane killer who escaped during a mental hospital field trip to a county fair that has infuriated residents and officials around Washington . Authorities have said they believe Phillip Arnold Paul is heading to the Sunnyside area , where his parents and many siblings live . The Spokane County Sheriff 's Office launched a helicopter on Friday in the search , and the public was urged to call 911 if Paul is spotted . `` He is in a bad mental state , '' his brother , Tom Paul , told The Associated Press . `` Why would they load him on a bus and take him to a fair ? '' `` Why was he allowed to take such a trip ? '' Gov . Chris Gregoire said Friday . `` Why did they go to a location that was so heavily populated with families ? '' Thirty-one patients from the mental hospital were on the trip with 11 staff members . Patients must be cleared by a treatment team before they can go on trips to stores , parks , ball games , fairs and other sites , said hospital spokesman Jim Stevenson . They wear street clothing and need not all stay together , but staff members are required to keep each patient within eyesight at all times .
Who said anything about blind support ? You 're arguing against a position that no one has raised here . The point is simply that gays know that they 'll be able to work with Obama and Biden if they get into office , and they wo n't be able to work with McCain or Palin . If you 're going to take Biden and Obama to task , do it in a way which wo n't hurt their chances of defeating McCain . Sure , people could jump up and down and scream about how they want more , but that would n't help . It would , in point of fact , do harm . If you have someone who is mostly a friend you correct them when you disagree with them , but not publically during an election .
It´s funny , there are gun-restrictions in Sweden and I have not been rounded up and exterminated yet . Must simply be a matter of time ... Honestly , Those arguments are totaly worthless . Compare the rate of criminality and murders in US and those of the average contries with gun-bans . Where do you think it´s highest ?
I support gay adoption only as a last resort . I am not a biggot but you have to realize that unless you are super rich being the child of a gay couple can have severe consequences . Lets face it . Kids are cruel and if a child has gay parents then they are a target . The best situation for any child is two parents one male and one female . However if that is absolutley not possible then I have no problem with gay adoption .
Call me crazy ,
Washington , D.C. -- U.S. court records from southwestern states clearly show that illegal gun traffickers involved in smuggling firearms to Mexico seek semiautomatic assault weapons , armor-piercing handguns , and 50 caliber anti-armor sniper rifles from U.S. gun shops according to a new report released today by the Violence Policy Center ( VPC ) . & # 8220 ; The NRA has received a free ride with its undocumented assertions , & # 8220 ; Rand said . & # 8220 ; Now , for the first time , the American people can see detailed information on the types of military-style firearms illegal traffickers are buying in the United States and shipping to Mexican criminals . This is merely a snapshot of the kind of detailed information about tens of thousands of smuggled guns that the federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms , and Explosives has in its files but no longer releases to the public or our elected representatives on Capitol Hill. & # 8221 ; VPC - Press Release - ( 04/15/2009 ) - Mexican Gun Traffickers Easily Obtain Military-Style Weapons from U.S . Civilian Gun Market , New Analysis of Federal Criminal Court Records Confirms its obvious America needs alot more gun control if mexican criminals have no problem buying things like cop killer handguns and 50 caliber and assault weapons in US gun shops !
The scientific method must stick to the measurable , observable and testable otherwise it stops being , well , science .
] The Third Reich did not need gun control ( in 1938 or at any time thereafter ) to maintain their power . The success of Nazi programs ( restoring the economy , dispelling socio-political chaos ) and the misappropriation of justice by the apparatus of terror ( the Gestapo ) assured the compliance of the German people . Arguing otherwise assumes a resistance to Nazi rule that did not exist . Further , supposing the existance of an armed resistance also requires the acceptance that the German people would have rallied to the rebellion . This argument requires a total suspension of disbelief given everything we know about 1930s Germany . Why then did the Nazis introduce this program ? As with most of their actions ( including the formation of the Third Reich itself ) , they desired to effect a facade of legalism around the exercise of naked power . It is unreasonable to treat this as a normal part of lawful governance , as the rule of law had been entirely demolished in the Third Reich . Any direct quotations , of which there are several , that pronounce some beneficence to the Weapons Law should be considered in the same manner as all other Nazi pronouncements - absolute lies .

Yeah , but your counter example is pretty bad . It 's easy to defraud a petition drive , it 's hard to defraud a general election .
Incredibly enough , ignoring my rebuttal does n't make you right .
Some materialists claim free will is an illusion , doesnt actually exist . They insist that what we see as spontaneous responses are merely chemical reactions and deterministic brain interactions .
The toxic spewings of the collective have a corrosive effect on society generally , validating and empowering in their own minds the estranged and paranoid .
Even a semiautomatic version of an assault rifle can be fired at an amazingly rapid rate .
but if it can not be supported by evidence or is redundant to a theory already described ... why would we ?
I do n't agree with this either/or binary logic .
However , all of that is quite beside the point in the case under discussion .

What kind of patterns , please be specific . What would you expect to see if ID were real ? If ToE were real we would ( for example ) expect to see nested hierarchies in taxa . If one ca n't attempt to falsify a theory then it is not open to science and therfore useless to science . It becomes simply an untestable belief .

My own personal view of it is that it will truly be a sad day indeed when the people are prohibited from exercising their clear constitutional right to amend their constitution . As far as answering the question of what the CA Supremes are likely to do , that I can not say , since they certainly are not bound to follow the constitution . But assuming they follow the constitution , the amendment will proceed to the November election , as well it ought to .
At age 18 ? That 's a possibility - a coworker of mine once expounded that every couple , with the consent of both parents , and at their own expense , should have an unlimited right to abortion all the way up to age 18 . ( He had had a fight with his teenage daughter that morning . ) I do n't think it will fly , but I support the people having the right to choose and I will live with their decision .
# 1 - How are we now able to observe evolution , when the evolution of the world supposely took billions of years ? # 2 - Can anyone prove to me without a doubt abiogenesis is the way life began , even though no one was there to observe it ? # 3 - Can anyone explain to me why no other apes , monkeys or chimps have evolved into a new ( i.e . human ) species ? # 4 - How do we know without a doubt the world is billions of years old ?
There is a lot of discussion regarding the validity of evolution on this board and some against creation . But since it is a clear fact that even if evolution was proven to be false , it would NOT make creation right , I think it is about time we hear some evidence for creation . Admittedly , I have yet to hear/see any so I am curious to find out if there any at all that does not rely on evolution being `` unproven '' ... ..
I 'm not against concealed carry in principle but open carry seems silly to me . I smell posers .
Hey Sarge , that looks like something I saw yesterday . New anti-gun strategy : Demonize CCW holders Anti-gunners . Why do you HATE our Constitutions Bill of Rights ? Why do you persecute people who can pass a background check not only once , but every time they purchase a new gun ? You told America that this would satisfy you , when this new law was proposed ! But NO ! You demonize us anyway ! We prove our lawfulness not only when we purchase a new gun , but also CCW people have to pass another background check when they apply for a Concealed Handgun License , then take a test and classes to boot ? We already have 22 to 30 thousand gun laws . When are you going to be reasonable ? So what 's the deal ? Why do you HATE America so much ? Why do you HATE us law-abiding people who keep our noses clean all of our lives ? Heck , I am 62 and have never run afoul of our laws . Do you think we are going to start now ? Descent and public discourse is fine , but I surely hope you folks are not planning violence against our Great and Unique Country ! You often sound like it is possible when you complain incessantly about our Constitution , our Rights and the laws of this nation governing the peaceful use and ownership of firearms .
Obviously you would n't like it . Heaven forbid equal rights . Heaven forbid tolerance . Heaven forbid actually treating people you do n't like as HUMAN .

There is not one single peer reviewed piece of evidence proving a link between birds and dinosaurs , fish to amphibians , a rational explanation of what caused the big bang etc . The comeback is that science just has n't found the proof yet . Or the favorite we have no proof because it happened long ago and far away .
Well , at least they 're trying to do it the right way , instead of finding some biased judges to render them some ruling .

The greatest possible ( anything you can name ) can only exist in a finite series . As you point out , this is not the case in an infinite series such as integers . So the definition that began this thread that God is identified as `` the greatest being possible '' must limit the possibilities to a finite number . As I write this I can see that it 's self-evident - but what I ca n't see is how this gets us any closer to showing that God exists ( or not ) !
Anyone can acquire arms from the black market , but we choose not to because we have legal alternatives . Take those legal alternatives away and it 'll be nothing more than a nation of several hundred million criminals .
I just wanted to add one more thing to clear up some stuff and make sure I have the standards set correctly before we delve into a hardcore debate of facts . When I use the word evolution , I am not referring to the minor variations found in all of the various life forms ( microevolution ) . I am referring to the general theory of evolution , correct me if I 'm wrong , which believes these five major events took place without God : 1 . Time , space , and matter came into existence by themselves . 2 . Planets and stars formed from space dust . 3 . Matter created life by itself . 4 . Early life forms learned to reproduce themselves . 5 . Major changes occurred between these diverse life forms ( i.e. , fish changed to amphibians , amphibians changed to reptiles , and reptiles changed to birds or mammals ) . Now here are the six main areas of evolution that we will be able to discuss : 1 . Cosmic evolution-the origin of time , space , and matter . Big Bang . 2 . Chemical evolution-the origin of higher elements from hydrogen . 3 . Stellar and planetary evolution-Origin of stars and planets . 4 . Organic evolution-Origin of life from inanimate matter . 5 . Macroevolution-Changing from one kind into another . 6 . Microevolution-Variations within kinds . Only this one has been observed . So there are some standards I guess you could say , sorry for lack of a better word but it has been a long day and my vocabulary is n't as sharp as it use to be . Correct me if I 'm misinformed or incorrect about any of my above statements concerning my understanding of evolution . Anyways I just wanted to add that real quick before I headed off to bed , and hopefully I will have those questions answered for you by tomorrow . Night ... ... .

I support legalization of every drug . I 'm sure most of you are young and have been fed XXXX like `` Marijuana will kill you . '' Actually it does less damage to the brain then alcohol and it can not kill you . It is impossible . It takes 20,000 joints in one sitting to overdose on marijuana . Alcohol however kills thousands of americans each year from alcohol poisoning . You know that XXXXX pothead . He did n't get dumb from pot , he got dumb from birth . Marijuana does not have long term effects on IQ . The only side effect is the lazy side effect . The day after a person tends to be more lazy however it is like a hang over ... .. it only lasts for a day . There is no reason why it should remain illegal . I also support all drugs being legalized because the drug war has failed . We spend billions each year on the drug war and I can call someone right now and pick up some crack . It is a failure . What we should do is make it government controlled and then spend the money to fight drugs on drug education . Flood the schools with ACTUAL info about how herion kills and how it breaks a person down . Tell the kids how you can die from one use of coke . Tell them the short term and long term effects of each drug . If we can educate our kids and even adults through an ad campaign about what drugs do to you then we could save far more people . Also allowing drugs to be regulated will lower the prices and effectively kill drug dealers and gangs off the streets . There are so many benefits to legalizing drugs . Anyone want to fight it ? I have proof to back up what I say and also have the effects of each drug .

`` The use of Pepper Spray is legal for carrying by a person 18 years of age or older '' `` Some examples of misuse include ; spraying on people in anger , as a joke , possession of by prohibited persons ; minors , drug addicts or persons convicted of felonies . '' Do n't know where you got that . I was watching a reality TV show ( my DVR quit on me ) about court files . A CA jury sentenced a teenage girl to 22 years of hard time for stabbing a 47 year old man when he tried to rape her . Assuming this is true ( which it could not be due to the fact that its reality TV ) , how can the jury sleep at night ? The defense proved that the man often made violent sexual advances on women , and the 17 year old girl was not inherently violent . She was convicted on second degree murder and sentenced to the maximum possible amount of time . Seriously , this is one F*cked up state .

November 26 , 2005 He Donated Sperm . Is He a Father ? ( 3 Letters ) To the Editor : Re `` Hello , I 'm Your Sister . Our Father Is Donor 150 '' ( front page , Nov. 20 ) : Given the advance of modern technology , parents have the right to fear that their children will have too many resources at their disposal and will disregard their parents ' guidance and seek it elsewhere . Children should not be allowed to go online and find their half-siblings or biological fathers without parental consent . Children in this position are not capable of making a decision of this magnitude . Their parents have their best interests at heart and should have control over the situation . It could be emotionally damaging to meet a half-sibling or a biological father if they are not ready , and only their parents know for sure . Parents are the people who raise and love their kids , not the people who give birth or donate sperm . Stephanie Singer -- Bloomfield Hills , Mich. , Nov. 21 , 2005 To the Editor : I am saddened that your Nov. 20 front-page article used the term `` father '' to refer to a sperm donor . `` Fathers '' are parents who raise children . They change diapers , go to soccer practice , supervise first dates . `` Fathers '' are members of a family , not anonymous sperm donors . There are millions of healthy parents raising children across our country . These parents may not be a traditional `` father '' and `` mother . '' They may be grandparents , single parents , gay parents , family friends , couples who adopt . How often will they be condemned for their absence of `` father '' ? When can we celebrate the reality of these successful , healthy , happy families without holding on to the false myth of the American family ? Alyson D. Miller -- Portland , Ore. , Nov. 20 , 2005 To the Editor : As your Nov. 20 front-page article points out , many sperm banks have not kept records of conceptions . But this is changing . Most sperm banks today not only keep records of conceptions and births , but also limit the number of families created by one donor . The article leaves the impression that all donor insemination offspring have little or no information about their donors and limited opportunity to connect with other donor families . In fact , since the early 1980 's , there has been a movement toward providing more information about donors to their offspring . The Sperm Bank of California pioneered a program in 1983 that allows adult offspring access to their donor 's identity . In 1997 , we started a family contact service to allow families who used the same donor to have contact with one another . In recent years , an increasing number of sperm banks have developed similar programs . The conventional wisdom is that most men would donate sperm only anonymously . But in the past two years , 75 percent of donors at our bank have chosen to participate in our identity program . Alice Ruby -- Executive Director , The Sperm Bank of California -- Berkeley , Calif. , Nov. 22 , 2005
First , a comment about your second link . Gould had this to say about the quotes on that page : It seems that creationists are still at it . Yes . That is one component of evolutionary thought . But there is more to it than that . Another component of evolutionary thought is that many times species remain static ( as far as the fossil record reveals ) for long periods of time , sometimes millions of years . Another component of evolutionary thought is that sometimes speciation can happen relatively rapidly , in a flash of geological time , maybe as little as 50 or 60 thousand years . Even Darwin hypothesized that changes that caused speciation took place in peripheral segments of the population . Just before World War II Dobzhansky and Mayr discussed the gaps in the fossil record and the reasons for them . They agreed with Darwin . Finally , in the 1960s Eldredge and Gould worked out the first statement of what became the theory of punctuated equilibria in which they elaborated on the previous thoughts of Darwin , Dobzhansky , and Mayr . I think their paper , in which they discussed their observations from the fossil record of just such events , was published in 1972 . Actually , the fossil record does support it . Both Eldredge and Gould have discussed it . Both men made observations of slow gradual speciation in the fossil record in a small geographical area . These changes were reflected at other locations as an abrupt change from one species to another . But given that such changes take place very quickly in populations that are usually under environmental stress and isolated from the main population , and given the rarity of fossilization in the first place , we do n't expect to find many examples in the fossil record . It is a bit like trying to time a 100 yd . dash with a sundial . The fossil record just is n't fine grained enough to see the rapid ( 50-60 thousand years ) changes . Nope . It does . Or maybe it supports the hypothesis of successive creation . The fossil record that we find certainly does n't support the creation as told in the Bible . Even the creationists who went in search of evidence of the flood some 200 years ago realized that the geology did n't support what the Bible said . So they thought that the geology represented many floods , the last one from the Bible being on top . This objection has already been answer by Gould in the quote above . But of course , what creationists demand is eyedropper precision from a fire hose . Nevertheless , we have some spectacular transitional forms . My favorite is Archaeopteryx . And there is a great progression from four legged land animal to two finned aquatic whales . Some whales in that progression had rear legs that would have been useless for walking . Really ? What evidence is that ?

At first sight , the Theory of Evolution is an elegant theory . Not only that , but its got the benefit of some of the worlds greatest minds working on and devising ways to keep it afloat so that the vast majority of the population can continue to be snow-blinded .

Very good point wjim but I want to drain the water from the Canada argument and leave it dry . If no statistics saying that Canada 's strict gun laws lowered crime then the argument is dry and useless . So far I have found statistics that say gun control results in a rise in crime . No one has disputed this with statistics . FACT : Gun control raises crime . or do you have proof saying the opposite If not then the argument saying gun control would lower crime is invalid . Agreed ?
uh huh ... I 'm not buying it .

As a responsible adult ( which all of our children will hopefully grow up to be ) I do this all the time with one decision or another .
2 . Evolutionists are always making assumptions . They assumed that the tonsils and the appendix were remnants of previous species from which humans had evolved and were totally useless . They were wrong about that . When the human genome was sequenced and it was found that only 5 % of it was used in genes they immediately assumed that the 95 % not in genes was 'junk ' . They were wrong again of course . The now called 'non-coding ' DNA is the source of what makes humans tick and a marvel of creation in itself .
Really I hear it all the time . I honestly do n't know why else they object to evolution , What is this other reason ?
What 's wrong with God being the explanation for the unexplanable , comfort for those affraid of death , and the meaning for life ?
Nothing will replace fossil fuels until they reach a market price that favors an alternative .

You can preach pretty religious philosophy all day long but I ai n't buying . Saying that Jesus told you that all life is special does n't comfort a rape victim , does n't provide health care to a woman without it , does n't feed a family if a single mom has to quit her job , does n't provide an education if she has to quit school . Reducing women to pretty quote that is hung in your kitchen does n't mean squat out in here in the real world , and it does n't indicate that you get it , let alone care .
Bertvan : Perhaps Dr. Pigluicci doesnt see a difference between the organization of a hurricane and the organization of a living system . Most people do see a difference . The deterministic mechanisms that affect a hurricane are well understood and predictable . On the other hand no one can even speculate how such things as temperature and embryonic diet might cause proteins to fold differently and thus whip up complex systems such as eyes , bacterial flagella , wings and turtle shells
What amazes me is someone could actually believe a constitutional ban on gay marriage is in anyway a contributing factor to divorce rates .

So how do creationists account for this : ERVs in humans match those in apes . ERV = useless code in DNA , but present in all members of a species Basically it goes like this . Viruses inject their DNA into the hosts DNA . This means that if the cell is able to replicate itself , it also replicates the viral DNA . As we all accept , creationists as well , sometimes things go wrong during this replication process . Sometimes , the viral DNA is rendered inactive . This is inconsequential as the cell dies and the error dies with it . But sometimes , this can happen to sperm cells that just happen to end up fertilizing . Therefore , the organism that is born from the fertilized egg carries this viral error ( ERV ) permanently and then passes it on . Since we can sequence viral DNA and have sequenced the entire human genome , we can go hunting for these viral sequences that have actually been propagating for millions of years . This is testable , every human on the planet has the same ERV 's each of which has resulted from a SINGLE little virus doing its thing at some point in our evolutionary history . For evolution to be false , and this is a golden opportunity for creationists to prove it false , you would have to see that in apes none of these ERVs are present and they would have their own unique set of ERVs . When we looked , we found them and in the exact right place out of billions of sequences . The only way this can currently be explained is with evolution . We have the same error in our DNA that all apes have . Each of these errors has a cause that we can trace to a single event . How can you deny that that single event took place in a common ancestor ?
I admonish both sides : Pro-Choice people : Try to understand that a pro-life person dose n't ( neccessarily ) want to control you , many simply believe in the sanctity of human life at conception . You believe in sanctity of life , but they believe it starts earlier than you do . You must admit that you do not have the answer to the issue of when a fetus converts from just a fetus with human properties to a full fledged human . This is why women that do not want to get pregnant MUST insist on taking the full responsibility of contraception with utmost respect and seriousness . The friends of mine that had abortions were not systematic with their routine as they should have been . More often than not ( but not always ) it is a big case of `` OOPS . '' The risk of pregnancy demands staunch discipline . Pro-life people , I understand your view on the premis of the fetus being a human life . But you have a bigger problem to address than just the suffering of fetuses . Do you not understand that millions upon millions of children around the world at this very moment in time do not have enough to eat , suffer from disease and are left orphans ? An abortion ends the human existence in the womb in a moment , a starving childs suffering can go on for years . ( A crisis in Africa right now -- some 1 million orphaned children . ) If you happen be a Pro-lifer who is Christian , Jesus said nothing on abortion to my knowledge ( ironically he did say woe to pregnant women who are nursing during the end times , LUKE 21:23 ) , however , he was very clear on feeding the hungry and poor MAT 25:35-46 : `` I was hungry and you did not take me in ... Inasmuch as you did not do for one of the least of these , you did not do for me . '' Ask yourself , `` What have I done today to follow Jesus ' teaching on feeding the hungry ? '' Please do all you can do to alleviate the pain and suffering of children that are in the world before you expend your energies to champion the cause of unborn children in the womb .
with regards to the cousins argument if a creature evolves into a new species would n't the old species not exist any more ?
We 're legally dead when we no longer mentally exist ( hence the term `` brain-dead '' ) , so there is no logical reason to set the beginning point as anything other than the start of the mental existence . Just as people who are dead and without mental existence do not have the ability to obtain rights , a collection of human cells without a mental existence can not obtain rights .

`` It is our contention that if 'random ' [ chance ] is given a serious and crucial interpretation from a probabilistic point of view , the randomness postulate is highly implausible and that an adequate scientific theory of evolution must await the discovery and elucidation of new natural laws , physical , chemical and biological .

And do n't turn around and tell me that that has nothing to do with evolution .
Then that & # 8217 ; s as far as we can go on it , and that & # 8217 ; s fine . Not being a science worshiper myself , I simply don & # 8217 ; t automatically take this type of blanket statement as automatically true .
Yet evolutionists tell us that evolution could never happen the same way twice . And the reason they say that -- one of them -- is that NS on the level of the population is random ... .which makes absolutely no sense what-so-ever .
There is enough knowledge and contraception around for unwanted pregnancies to be a rarity .
Just out of curiosity , what do you feel you could sue the company for ? Descrimination ? Could I sue Wal Mart or Dillons for not carrying a line of adult movies and sex toys ? After all , I have a right to own adult movies and sex toys . Does n't that mean that Wal Mart automatically has the responsibillity to provide those goods ? After all , they are the biggest retailer in my area .

This is not what hospitals do with biomedical waste . They incinerate it . If these people are really doing this I can '' t imagine who the buyer is , and they are breaking many many laws .
No . They are no longer making the decisions and therefore should not be allowed to pick . However , if a criminal requests the death penalty , are there retrials to ensure the state is n't killing a innocent person ?
Belief in and reverence for a supernatural power or powers regarded as creator and governor of the universe . A personal or institutionalized system grounded in such belief and worship . The life or condition of a person in a religious order . A set of beliefs , values , and practices based on the teachings of a spiritual leader . A cause , principle , or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion .
Your answers are ridiculous , ChuzLife , just like all the others . I never mentioned a child trap . You are all liars trying to distort My posts , and hide from the realities of abortion . I said a womb-trapped child . Thats 100 % descriptive . Its a child , in the womb , who is not able to leave . I never said that they are trapped by the vagina . I never suggested that pre-birth children float around and are somehow `` caught '' in a trap . None of your can face up to the Forbidden Truth on abortion .
If you spend much type speaking with physicists , you will often hear one say `` If einstein was right ... .. '' This is what they are talking about .

Show me winking and nodding going on , marc . Stop insinuating bad behaviour and show me the evidence . Show me atheism being taught in the science classroom .
This one line stuck out because it mentioned evolution in a future context . Something I have not heard before .
[ to supersport ] Please show me an example of a peppered moth that changes from dark to light or light to dark .
Exactly what parts need to be substantiated ?
so why is population control a good arguement for abortion ? Why do n't we kill old people too ...
There is simply no benefit to the scientific community if ID is accepted . It 's simply a view . No proof , no thinking , and no contribution to science , simply religion disguised as science .
I am a gay Christian woman , live in Northern CA , and am VERY happily MARRIED to my wife as of June of 2008 . It is NOT a sin to be GLBT , but I would say that homophobia is definitely one .
Evolutionists , in an attempt to win converts , have a habit of saying evolution is a fact .
Robert Naeye , a writer for Astronomy magazine and an evolutionist , wrote that life on earth is the result of a long sequence of improbable events [ that ] transpired in just the right way to bring forth our existence , as if we had won a million-dollar lottery a million times in a row.
Voted To Ban Gay Marriage Christian Conservative GOP Senator Linked To DC Madam by The Associated Press
`` Elections matter . We have a pro-life Senate , '' the Kansas Republican said in an interview . It sounds like there might be some change coming up . The Senate is basically now pro-life now , and are even going to attemt to stop future filibusters .
So if a person hearing your statement does n't consider it carefully , it 's very easy to be mislead by it . It implies that `` evolution '' ( the branch that declares that the book of Genesis is false ) is somehow a secular , observable truth - while creationism is nothing but a religion , a superstition .
I havent heard from Brady in a while , so I thought I would rattle his cage door .
It is perfectly valid for someone to have the opinion that 'life ' begins with recordable brain activity ( as early as 40-days post-conception ) ... or 'self-awareness ' or any other such concept , or when the entity would be 'viable ' outside the womb . But there are varying levels of brain activity . There is no agreed upon definition of self-awareness .
The end ! Thanks everybody .
Now that 's what I 'm talking about .
Its very recent information and has not been fully confirmed by others . However the London School of ergonomics is well respected worldwide . Although I must admit I have never heard of the investigator . And the lagomorph is a very primitive one by all accounts . Still if Haldane admitted this would kick the bucket over then the implications are enormous . One wonders if there are relicts of this species still lurking about - there was that Killer rabbit incident back in the Carter years . There appears to be a thread discussing the implications of these findings on the Pandas Thumb Board http : //www.pandasthumb.org/archives/ ... eat_debat.html I have not dug through it all yet , but I suspect a consensus will emerge in a few more years . Between the rabbit and the hobbit the evolutionists have a lot on their plates .
But he does have a point..
3 . Rational is as rational does . If it is our goal to raise peoples consciousness to the wonders of science and the power of reason , then we must apply science and reason to our own actions . It is irrational to take a hostile or condescending attitude toward religion because by doing so we virtually guarantee that religious people will respond in kind . As Carl Sagan cautioned in The Burden of Skepticism ,  a 1987 lecture , You can get into a habit of thought in which you enjoy making fun of all those other people who dont see things as clearly as you do . We have to guard carefully against it.
Have you done anything about them ? Gay marriage has only been an issue for a couple of years , most of the other things I mentioned have been around for decades . Which have you actually done more about , or spoken out against more ? I say you 've done more in one year to fight gay marriage than you 've done to `` save '' marriage from everything else that 's assailling it since you were born . Can you truthfully say I 'm wrong ? If you ca n't , then you care more about opposing gays then you do about saving marriage , and any claim to the contrary is hypocracy .
Apparently gay marriage is more threatening than unmarried gay couples are . The point about legalizing gay households is certainly puzzling unless one contends that cohabitation is illegal ( which it is n't ) . But just in case I 'm wrong , perhaps the authorities should be notified of all the heterosexual unmarried couples and they should be hauled off to jail .
So what is your answer to the thoughts I got about some things ?
From CNN I 'm glad to see that at least some pastors in this world have integrity and are not bigoted and want all citizens to have the same rights . It 's refreshing to see that there are many churches like this ( my own is similar ) , but I wish there were more who were not bigoted . The others give Christianity a bad name and cause people to associate Jesus and the church with intolerance and removal of equal rights . Oh , and could n't agree more with Ahnuld .
Many times , rape results in possible health problems for the mother , in which case I would have no qualms about abortion . But the truth is that the baby can not help having been brought into the world any more than the woman could have helped being raped , and does n't deserve to be killed any more than the woman does .
Please do n't take offence , it 's a JOKE .
Therefore , we can conclude that teaching evolution is not teaching knowledge nor science , and as such , is teaching ignorance ( defined as lack of knowledge ) .
Can you own property ?
Now , if we found an account from Roman times of how Julius Caesar split the waters of the Rubicon by urinating in it so his troops could pass ... Occam 's Razor would not point towards accepting it as true .
Can we get an unbiased point of view ? The bible is not just a book . It is the infallible word of God . And I would like to know what proof there is for evolution ?
The whole who is on top thing is an inapplicable concept .
Anyway , again , I ask you which account of Eve . There are 2 . One makes no mention of a rib . I believe that Genesis is important , but I think that it must be read and understood on a little bit more of an abstract an general manner than say , Mark .
A recent study by the FBI found that out of a random sampling of various criminals booked on firearms charges , only ONE of the polled individuals had procured a gun from a gun show .
An apology would be nice . Also an admission that they were wrong about the blood running through the streets .
At least you are aware of your own mental deficiencies .
So what are you doing here ? look at mahatma ghandi . he was a pacifist and he freed india
1 . I do n't support mandatory sentencing guidelines . I prefer judges to actually do some judging . I do support latitude for DA 's when it comes to filing charges . This is SOP .
the Biblical support for free will is the assumption that God is not willing that any man should perish , but that all should come to repentance . If God chooses everybody 's decisions for them ( or forces them to choose only the options He approves of ) then the trillions of people that are bound for Hell were forced to go there by God himself . in fact , God must have wanted them to go there from the beginning of time . this is obviously contrary to the nature of God according to the Bible , as far as I know
Men ( and women for that matter ) are n't `` created '' equal . Some people are faster , brainer , stronger , fitter , better leaders or whatever than others . Whilst a degree of this is nuture based , some of it is nature based .
I agree . Lets argue what we value or do n't value and why - not definitions . I started this thread proposing a few alternate terms . Those terms or others could constitute one compromise .
And what of when you go by some moral standard to determine what is right and wrong in other peoples ' lives as well ? What ? you do n't do that ? Bull . You ca n't tell me you never have an opinion or judgment on anything anyone else does . But by your logic , that would be imposing on them . Sorry , that dog just does n't hunt . Everyone has some basis for the views they have about they way they think society would be best . There 's no law that says people ca n't participate in that process with religion or anything else as their moral basis . 'Imposing religion ' is not the same as using religion as a basis , and it 's the fact that you are wrong on this that 's why religious people are continually able to have religion as their basis of social change , just as equally as anything else .
Actually , no , my understanding is that in most states the law does n't require this at all . Many doctors take what is known as the Hipocratic oath , but it 's not a legally binding oath . Doctors may be subject to personal lawsuits , but that 's not the same thing . Also , the fact the church you mentioned owns a `` beachside pavillion '' has nothing to do with much of anything . If the church truly owns it , they can refuse any ceremony they want . That it has been `` open to all for years '' carries no weight whatsoever . It is church property -- which is essentially the same as a church saying it does n't want gay ceremonies in its sanctuary which churches are free to refuse . Maybe churches are imposed upon in such ways in Canada , but not in the US . Given these matters , I 'm not sure the HRC is being any more honest than the video they are responding to .
And do n't even go around claiming I was not what I once was . I assure you , and if you really wanted to , I can get the confirmation records , etc .
Lets break this down . Most pro-choice advocates think that intelligence is when human life starts , or consciousness or self awareness is what makes an embryo have rights . The Lifers say that it should have rights regardless of its physical state .
An interesting analysis of that article you keep quoting from the World Net Daily . http : //www.saneguns.org/commentary/comment002.html
I actually do n't think anyone should be forced into parenthood . But if you do n't want to be a dad - then sign away your parental rights and be up front about it . You do n't walk six months into the pregnancy or after the kid is born .
Leviathan has the following attributes according to Job chapter 41 , Psalm 104:25,26 and Isaiah 27:1 . This is only a partial listingjust enough to make the point . No one is so fierce that he would dare stir him up. Who can open the doors of his face , with his terrible teeth all around ?  His rows of scales are his pride , shut up tightly as with a seal ; one is so near another that no air can come between them ; they are joined one to another , they stick together and can not be parted. His sneezings flash forth light , and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning . Out of his mouth go burning lights ; sparks of fire shoot out . Smoke goes out of his nostrils , as from a boiling pot and burning rushes . His breath kindles coals , and a flame goes out of his mouth. Though the sword reaches him , it can not avail ; nor does spear , dart , or javelin . He regards iron as straw , and bronze as rotten wood . The arrow can not make him flee ; slingstones become like stubble to him . Darts are regarded as straw ; he laughs at the threat of javelins. On earth there is nothing like him , which is made without fear. Leviathan played in the great and wide sea ( a paraphrase of Psalm 104 verses 25 and 26get the exact sense by reading them yourself ) . Leviathan is a reptile [ a ] that is in the sea. ( Isaiah 27:1 ) [ a ] Note : The word translated reptile here is the Hebrew word tanniyn . This shows that Leviathan was also a tanniyn ( dragon ) .
Let me know when you learn how to manipulate the quote commands . I 'll reveal part of my next reply right now . If I stick my hand in fire , I will get burned . This is a logical derivation ... like If A , then B . It comes from experience and mother 's teachings . It will not change . EVER ! It is quite logical to assume that in the future , if you stick your hand in fire , you will be burned .
Factual ? Last time I checked , it was the THEORY of evolution , not the LAW of evolution . Evolution and Creation are both theories , neither of them can be proved scientifically per se .
My anti-freedom agenda ? What the hell are you talking about ? Are you an anarchist ? That 's the only way to have 100 % freedom . The fact that government exists means that there are restrictions . So unless you are an anarchist , I can call you anti-freedom as much as you call me anti-freedom . The question is the degree to which government should restrict freedoms , and that is not an obvious question to answer .
`` ... . on what basis do you explain the many other religions that exist on Earth ? Especially those that were around before Christianity ... ..
However , there is one thing that the prominent religions have in common that I think they may have right if 'he/she/it ' does exist , and that is the idea of omnipresence . To put it simply , if there is a Godlike entity I think it is probably the universe . This is pure conjecture , but I believe the universe could be a conscious entity . Why not ? It would not have thought processes that we as humans could in any way relate to , and given the predictability of physical phenomena according to the laws we have discovered it would not seem to be able to will anything to happen , but it could still have a sense of itself and an awareness of everything within it . This inability of humans to understand this hypothetical consciousness is why I can not subscribe to a religion ; if 'he/she/it ' does exist there is no way any human could possibly understand it , relate to it , communicate with it , or even know that it exists . I doubt very much that it , if it exists , would have any interest in individual human beings ; it would see us as purely an extension of the matter that makes up the planet , after all that is essentially what we are .
Supersport , where art thou now ... Bah , who am I kidding . Of course he wo n't come over here ...
This is what evolutionists do when they have no argument , they change the subject .
By the way gun hater Sarah Brady wants the very same laws and more !
.50 caliber rifles have been legal for ownership since the revolutionary days . They even had .75 caliber rifles .
That would be Miami , where a playstation costs more on the street than an AK47 ... ... ... ..
Wait a minute , I fail to see how it not being availible will affect teenagers doing it or not .
M-14 is what your suppose to love definitely M-14 .
So the argument that this is a breach of separation of church and state is pretty weak , IMO .
I agree about your second point . Was this peppered moth not hailed as an `` example of evolution in action '' ? If so , this implies that it is proof of evolution .
Pretty soon , the policy will be nationwide . Pretty soon , all highly technical jobs will be exported so that we can all praise the lord as we fall to third world status .

Actually , the word evolution never means atheism except when used by creationists who want to pretend that science is anti-christian .
Yes and no ( on the people close to me ) . while I definatly do n't like to see people close to me killed , it is no surprise when it happens , since , as I already said , my opinion of the human race is pretty low .
I wonder if anti-abortion folks ever consider that ?
Again ? ? ? ? Gun control laws by design are meant to kept inner city citizens ( i.e . black ) from owning guns ... Liberal terms such as `` saturday night special '' all have racist undertones . Also since the majority of gun violence in the US is minority on minority ... Who are these laws meant to target ?
She is saying , and I 'm agreeing that at every stage of development a human possesses inherent value and dignity . Until the egg is fertilized their is no maturing person to kill , but once fertilized , their is a person growing from that very point on through to its birth . [ bold added ]
I personally think conservatives undermine their stated adherence to originalism with their moral opposition to abortion influencing their legal thinking with the `` it 's not in the Constitution '' position . This position is in opposition to the maxim that the Bill of Rights is not the exhaustive listing of the citizen 's rights and is a fruition of the Federalist 's fears and warnings about the dangerousness of trying to list rights . Conservative opposition to Roe and abortion rights in general belie their supposed allegiance to the concept of a government with strictly limited powers -- for saying that a unenumerated right does not exist where no power is conferred to act in that arena is stating that no limits on government 's power exist . . . That government power shall fill the void , not liberty . Scalia 's error in Heller was trying to explain the 2nd as a historical entity instead of explaining SCOTUS 's application of the Amendment in prior cases . Heller neither stated or established anything new ; there never was a `` state '' or `` collective '' right aspect to the 2nd . . . It was always interpreted by SCOTUS to be an individual right exercisable , claimable and enforceable by individuals separately from any militia connection . I just wish Scalia had restated and relied on SCOTUS 's prior holdings that the right is not created , granted or otherwise established by the Amendment so the right is not dependent in any manner upon the words of the Amendment . . . Why he engaged in the linguistic analysis I 'll never know or understand . Is there a point here ? Did n't the dissenting Justices all agree that the right is an individual right , claimable and enforceable by individuals ? It is clear the Stevens dissent was focused on a misreading of Miller 's holding and his just for gun rights metamorphosis supporting the illegitimate assumption that the government can exercise vast unspecified and unenumerated powers just because it feels like it . In Heller Stevens abandons his belief in Roe 's `` prenumbra '' theory , that the Bill of Rights is just a rough outline of liberty interests that stand as examples of many others . I endorse Justice Harlan 's dissent in Poe without Stevens ' recent equivocation and find it to be a compelling argument in constitutional interpretation , since elevated to the opinion of the Court in a case which Stevens concurred : `` Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects . See U.S . Const. , Amdt . 9 . As the second Justice Harlan recognized : ' [ T ] he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause can not be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution . This `liberty´ is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property ; the freedom of speech , press , and religion ; the right to keep and bear arms ; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures ; and so on . It is a rational continuum which , broadly speaking , includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints , . . . and which also recognizes , what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must , that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment . ' '' Casey v. Planned Parenthood , 505 U.S. 833 , 848 ( 1992 ) This famous exposition is a long standing favorite of Stevens . He cited it in his dissent in Albright v. Oliver , 510 U.S. 266 , 306-07 ( 1994 ) . But he abandons his relationship with these ideals in Heller ? Give me a break . . . Who 's sacrificing his principles for policy ? At least Scalia 's error results in an outcome that is consistent with his fundamental beliefs . That can not be said for Stevens . Just for info sake , Harlan 's dissent is also quoted in the plurality ( Stevens concurring ) in Moore v. City of East Cleveland , 431 U.S. 494 , 502 ( 1977 ) , it was originally written by Justice Harlan in his dissent in Poe v. Ullman , 367 U.S. 497 , 543 ( 1961 ) And if that was the accepted rule for Constitutional interpretation we would still have Jim Crow and the 14th Amendment would be as useful as the 3rd . Total Fail on your part again Galileo . . .
Your right . The majority is not stopping me from having sex with my partner or living life with my partner ( assuming I had one ) . But here is the definition of marriage . Definitions of marriage on the Web : * the state of being a married couple voluntarily joined for life ( or until divorce ) ; `` a long and happy marriage '' ; `` God bless this union '' * two people who are married to each other ; `` his second marriage was happier than the first '' ; `` a married couple without love '' * the act of marrying ; the nuptial ceremony ; `` their marriage was conducted in the chapel '' * a close and intimate union ; `` the marriage of music and dance '' ; `` a marriage of ideas '' Nowhere in there does it say man and woman only . What would be the reason for not allowing same sex marriage ? There was same sex marriage in ancient Rome ( until the Christians came into power and put to death all of the gay couples who were married ) , parts of Africa , Asia , and I believe the native americans had some form of gay marriage . And if you can figure out some of the issues with polygamy such as inheritance and who gets to make decisions for one of the spouses should they become unable to make those decisions for themselves then I dont really care . But insest can produce a child with severe medical problems .
and the atheist can not restrict the science to be according to their views .
Get a clue . That 's like banning drugs . They 're illegal now , but tons of people do them . Does this stop them ? Not one bit . You said guns , not weapons . Then you say most crimes are committed using weapons . Should we just bans all types od weapons ? What about knives , pipes , crowbars , baseball bats , glass , rocks , curbs , etc ? People use them all the time to commit crimes .
I have some questions for everyone here . For example , what is each side trying to prove ? Are the evolution supporters trying to convince others of evolution , or are they trying to defend evolution ?
No , you 're spreading false information . People interested in the truth try to avoid this . Those given to emotional rhetoric do n't mind one bit if it suits their agenda .
The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems , at every scale from local to global . The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation , climate change and air pollution , water shortage and water pollution , and loss of biodiversity . In the report , senior U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization official Henning Steinfeld reports that the meat industry is one of the most significant contributors to todays most serious environmental problems '' [ 3 ] and that `` urgent action is required to remedy the situation . `` [ 4 ] Other points the report makes are that the world 's livestock industry `` generates 65 per cent of human-related nitrous oxide , which has 296 times the Global Warming Potential ( GWP ) of CO2 '' [ 5 ] and `` that livestock are responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions , a bigger share than that of transport . `` [ 6 ]
Define evil . The concept of evil is very subjective . If something is truly evil , then there must be an absolute concept of evil . But you will never come to agreement with everyone else in the world as to what makes something truly evil or good . What is your standard for determining what is evil ?
No , the church is not evolving . Neither is society , language , ethics , morality , or our ability to shop . Only biological populations evolve .

The only people that the law affects is the law abiding citizen , it does not affect the criminal because he does not care about laws , he doesnt care about gun control , he doesnt care about the cops , and he certainly doesnt care about your life .

Homosexuality is deviant in the sense that it is n't `` the norm '' . That does n't mean that it ca n't have benefits that outweigh its 'abnormal '' nature . I 'm a very strong advocate for kids and I believe that any loving couple is better than a single parent home or similar .
No . The fetus does not have all of these things up and running until birth . The baby needs more than nutrition . It relies on the mother 's anti-bodies for it 's immune system ( even AFTER birth to some degree ) , it does not breath or take in oxygen on it 's own , and none of body systems are developed until late in the pregnancy .
How about someone abort you ? Would you like that ? May your illicit flame turn Hare Krishna on a Friday afternoon .

3 ) This variation is passed down by inheritance to future generations . ( We know that black folks have black kids ; white folks , white kids ; tall parents tend to have tall children ; and so on . ) Ok ... .this may be true ... however , not necessarily . Epigenetics tells us that the a mother mouse 's diet can effect the coat color of baby mice ... .with a diet high in protein ( I think it 's protein ? ) ... can induce a darker coat color in offspring . There is no change in DNA -- just a change in phenotype .

Edit : Yea , shouldnt this be in the religion section ... ?
I 'm not as sad as that . The definition of sad is defending something ( evolution ) that does n't have a leg to stand on anymore ( fossil evidence does n't prove evolution ) . There are that many holes in the evolution theory it 's a joke .

BeHereNow : Well , youre just begging the question of what is evidence . You are saying religious belief ( others might say religious knowledge ) is not evidence . If it is scientific , it is evidence . If it is not scientific , it is not evidence . Have I got it right ? Obvious child : If you use the proper definition of faith yes . Faith is a belief in something with no evidence .
... here is what is hard to understand about that ; In Matthew , 12:30 , Jesus says `` He who is not with me is against me , and he who does not gather with me scatters '' .
The difference , Eddie is simply this . If the Constitution needs to be changed , the founders instigated a means to do so . Said means is doubly hard as to make sure what is done , has been given much thought and study . The plan afoot today by the Gun Grabbers is to incrementally usurp the rights of free men , until , the fait accompli has been established . If the Right to Keep and Bear Arms , or any of the other rights guaranteed by the Constitution are to be abridged , they must ne done so by legal means , i.e . constitutional amendment .

Got ta ask . If god is all knowing and all powerful , why does Satan exist ? He knew Satan would be evil , yet he still `` created '' him ? Then , he ca n't get rid of Satan . Makes no sense whatsoever .

You have two tables , one with a small test tube which you know holds a microscopically small living zygote , and another table with a live baby . You are told that one of them will be destroyed and you have just two seconds to decide which , or both will be destroyed . Without a seconds thought I would immediately point in the direction of the zygote , and save the life of the baby .
Bush Is The Man , how can you question the story aganist Bush yet spin and ignore stories with the same amount of evidence aganist Kerry ?
To Ooaman ; This is evolution as observed across a span of a couple of generations , which is the unit that evolutionary change occurs . Obviously a generation of a small bird is n't as long as it is for us , for example .
Are you claiming that black women are being forced into abortion ? If not , then how is `` genocide '' being committed if they themselves are choosing abortion ? By the way , the rates of abortion in whites vs blacks are similar to the rates of teenage pregnancy between whites and blacks . From http : //www.teenpregnancy.org/america ... sp ? ID=3 & amp ; sID=20 , there is a roughly three times higher rate of teenage pregnancies among black women than among white women ( 153/1000 vs 55/1000 ) . From http : //www.abortionfacts.com/statistics/race.asp , the abortion rate for whites is 12/1000 while it is 31/1000 for black women . Note , the 1000 refers to 1000 women of child-bearing age ( or 1000 teenage women in the case of teenage pregancy rates ) . Since there is a much higher rate of teenage pregnacny among black women , it makes sense that there would be a much higher rate of abortion among black women . So , the main question is `` Why is there so much more teenage pregnancy among black women ? `` . I would think that poverty is a main reason . African Americans started off poor because of the legacy of slavery and stayed poor for ages because of unbridled discrimination . The last few decades have produced enormous changes in laws and practices governing discrimination . Unfortunately for African Americans , just as they were gaining more freedoms from discrimination in law and practice , socio-economic changes in the US made it more difficult for anybody who was poor ( black or white ) to get into the middle class . However , I hope that more African Americans will be able to take more advantage of those opportunities that they do still have to advance to higher levels ( in education , sports , etc . ) .
funny how darwinists , when presented with evidence that lifeforms are intelligent and dynamic -- which refutes their mechanistic theory -- turn around claim it as evidence for their theory . Go figure . I guess that 's about all they can do at this point : play dumb and hope nobody notices .
3 . By ESTHER DUFLO FOR millions of girls around the world , motherhood comes too early . Those who bear children as adolescents suffer higher maternal mortality and morbidity rates , and their children are more likely to die in infancy . One reliable way to solve this problem is through education . The more affordable it is , the longer girls will stay in school and delay pregnancy . I advise a nonprofit foundation called Innovation for Poverty Action that focuses on keeping girls in school . ( We arent alone ; lots of other terrific organizations do this , too . ) In a pilot program we ran in Kenya a few years ago , around 5,000 sixth-grade girls in 163 primary schools were given a $ 6 school uniform free . If they stayed in school , they received a second uniform after 18 months . The dropout rate over the next three years decreased by a third , to 12 percent , and the pregnancy rate fell to 8 percent from 12 percent . Of every 50 girls given free uniforms , then , three stayed in school as a result of the uniforms alone , and two delayed pregnancy . The benefits of secondary education are even greater . In the same group of Kenyan girls , 50 percent of those who dropped out after primary school had a child within two years , but only 8 percent who went on to secondary school became pregnant in that same period .

What if the answer to that was 0 ? You have begged the question .
Accidents for one . Just last week a man who was drinking and cleaning his firearm accidentally shot and killed his daughter . Run a google search for `` man shoots self '' the amount of accidental shootings is rather disturbing yet funny . Most of these however are due to improper gun safety though .
Genomes are littered with nonfunctional pseudogenes , faulty duplicates of functional genes that do nothing , while their functional cousins ( the word does n't even need scare quotes ) get on with their business in a different part of the same genome . And there 's lots more DNA that does n't even deserve the name pseudogene . It , too , is derived by duplication , but not duplication of functional genes . It consists of multiple copies of junk , `` tandem repeats '' , and other nonsense which may be useful for forensic detectives but which does n't seem to be used in the body itself .
abortion is bad , there should n't be a need for it in the perfect world , but i 'm not going to force my morality down your throat and force you to abide to MY principals while demanding you abandon your own .
James Madison in Federalist 51 explained , `` In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men the great difficulty lies in this : You must first enable the government to control the governed , and in the next place , oblige it to control itself . ''
Jesus was then what he is now : the Logos of God ( Philo , quis rerum divinarum heres 42.405 ) , the heavenly High Priest ( Hebrews ) , the culmination of Gods eternal plan ( Ro . 16:25 ) , the secret mystery only now , after his sacrifice , revealed through revelation and scripture ( 1 Cor 2:6-13 ) . A . # 1 is above . The Jesus myth came out of Hellenistic Judaism already heavily imbued with the ideas of the suffering servant ( Isaiah 53 ) and the son of God subject to a shameful death ( Wisdom of Solomon Let us condemn him with a shameful death ) . Paul refers to the archons , the evil heavenly rulers of the age , as those who crucified Jesus ( 1 Cor 2:8 ) and extols the justice of the Romans ( Ro . 13:1-3 ) . The earliest layers of Q material do not refer to a death or resurrection ( Kloppenborg ) . No earthly Jesus , no crucifixion , no death . It is all myth , man . We do n't know for sure . Traditionally thought to be Homer but is probably from oral tradition . Single authorship itself is disputed . Beyond that , I do n't know much about it . What is your point in asking this question ?
Nothing you said changes the fact that one person , the Oregon Attorney General is blocking the will of the people from being known by not submitting the required State Approved Ballot Title . foundit attempted to claim this was a fairly won victory , and I just pointed out that was n't true at all . And these gay talking points about seeking EQUALITY have to end . Unless you can produce evidence that gay people were originally kidnapped from their native lands by force , brought here in shackles , sold like farm animals , owned like property , and forced to work like beasts of burden as they were whipped and beaten if they did n't perform as required . Is that your story Op ? If so , then why are you referred to as Ohio professor ? I never knew a slave that had such a superior sounding name . Your tiny minority is seeking special rights , not equality . You have all the same rights that we all have . You want a special dispensation for being gay and you do n't deserve it at all . Nor do you deserve the right to marry unless you can fulfill Gods command to be fruitful and multiply . That 's why same gender marriage has never been respected or honored by the larger community Op , because it can never fulfill the reason that marriage and families were originally formed . And even though past civilizations have accepted gay people as a real , and even vital part of the community in some Societies , in no other generation in the history of the World has same sex marriage ever been considered as a good or positive option for the improvement of the Society .

I think his point is paulie , that if evolution is actually as evo defines it , as changes made by way of random mutations , then why does n't life reflect those random mutations ? For example , why have n't a large number of lower animals who live their lives being hunted by carnivores adapted eyes in the back of their heads as a needed early warning system to see their stalkers coming from behind them ?

You missed the point ! Earlier in Life , Freud described God as a Father wish fullfilment notion . Later in Life , Freud condicted himself and saluted the Swiss Theologian AND God ! Now , look , we all evolve , and grow our childish beliefs ( e.g . atheism ) I will go further , NO one is an Atheist on their Death bed or in a Fowhole as the WWII guys knew all too well .
Well your right , Waxy There is no real `` logic '' to my post , because if one thinks about the art of debating religion , the concept of logic goes out the window . A true believer has only the bible to support their beliefs , they can not go to a lab or science room and prove their beliefs on a table , or use cobalt to date religous belief , so their belief is all based on unseen faith . I have only a high school education , therefore I do not have the vocabulary the master debators use on here , nor the artistic way of putting together sentences . So bear with me please , while I try to explain my post a little better ... . Since you put me in the spotlight here , I will use you , with great respect to you of course , as my point of debate . You have went on record here stating many times , that you do not believe in a `` god '' the way we believers do . Now with that notion in mind , why do you and others hang out debating on a religous forum ? ? In case you havent noticed , the posts against the notion of God and Christianity , greatly outnumber the posts of the believers . Is that not a interesting fact when you think about it ? I dont believe in a lot of things that I am exposed to in my walk though life here on earth , so I have NO interest in trying to prove those things wrong , THAT I feel have no validity . Clear as mud now , ? ?

I 've just done a bit of hunting around , and I ca n't find anything to say Jerome had anything to do with the compilation of the Bible , only the translation of the Latin vulgate , which I 'll gladly admit is not an accurate translation . As for why I have argued the point , I think the truth is important , and I think it 's two easy to take a blanket `` oh , it was all political so we ca n't trust any of it '' approach to the Bible , and this is done largely in a manner that resembles special pleading . No other historical source or collection of sources is questionned with anything like this level of intensity or scepticism . It smacks of an attempt to justify ones own disbelief by discrediting the evidence . It does n't seem to be about a search for the truth , only to justify a preconcieved position .
In fact some of the most ardent anti-abortion people I 've met are also some of the most ardent anti-comprehensive sexual education people as well .
Powerful opponents of eco-terrorism are mounting the nation 's most formidable campaign against the homegrown sabotage . But the crime wave they hope to quell -- a 2½-year escalation of arsons and property destruction -- subsided last summer , perhaps due to law enforcement crackdowns . A congressional subcommittee held a hearing on eco-terrorism last month in which lawmakers , keyed up about terrorists since the Sept. 11 attacks , likened America 's green underground to al-Qaida . An FBI official testified that the Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front had become the nation 's most active and destructive domestic terrorist groups .

There are in fact no transitional fossils known . Some believe there are because they have been told there are . An examination of the fossils proves otherwise . What there are however , is thousands of animals in fossils which exist exactly today as they did hundreds of millions of years ago without noticable change . .
You are basically implying that if pro-lifers would n't oppose the pro-choice movement , you all could work more toward making it rare . Do you really think that a lot of the pro-choice people in your movement would put as much effort into making rare as you do trying to make it legal ? Based on the efforts to make it rare so far , I do n't think so .

The Brady Center has released a report on President Obamas performance called President Obamas First Year : Failed Leadership , Lost Lives .

Articles up to 10 years old are usually fine for scientific analysis . I once read a creationist book by Scott Huse , i think it was . His references ranged from 1880 to 1960 . Hardly convincing .
`` Certainly , I think it would be fair to say that it would be more likely for a court decision to impose the recognition of same-sex marriage from Massachusetts on another state in the event of the repeal of D.O.M.A. , '' Pepperdine Law Prof. Douglas Kmiec told ABC News .
I think the relationship between science and faith is often distorted by the nature of the discussions we have here . We debate matters where faith is being used to advocate views that are in direct contradiction of what science has discovered- the YEC view ( for example ) is an extreme . I do n't think this paints a very complementary picture of faith in most peoples minds . We touch far less on the more intriguing and subtle matters such as the reconcilliation of scientific outlook with a religious one .
You made the claim that if you have a gun in your possession , this fact magnifies your chances of somehow being shot . What you suggest can only happen if magic somehow exists , like the legally-owned guns sends out powerful magnetic waves to attract the criminals and hypnotizes them to shoot in a situation that they normally would n't shoot .
Forget law abiding , convicted felons on death row are free to marry if they so desire . I have never found anything wrong with that either . At the end of the day marriage deals with the two consenting adults who have decided to legally document their partnership .
Especially since your first claim was pretty outrageous . Laws will exist whether religion does or not . Religion is similar to a book of laws although that does n't mean that it existed before the laws did . Trying to even say humans would n't exist without God should n't even be brought up . The Christian God that is described in the Bible might not even exist . The Bible is flawed at the very least meaning doubt has to be placed in anything written in it that is n't provable .
The people should decide becasue that is democracy . There have been times which democracy has failed but when the courts intiate against the people . The people have the right to change the constitution when courts abuse their poswers . They ca n't violate separation of powers and not expect the people to change it .

Sex outside of marriage is still fornication , but I do not see those folks seeking special rights . Do you have the right to exercise your faith in any way you see fit ?
Its amazing how science can cure diseases , smash the atom , and create nuclear explosions , yet be so wrong about everything thats mentioned in the Holy Bible .
Wonderful News . Nice to see that at least some of the states here in the US have some common sense and are at least heading towards equality for gay couples . Good to hear about Oregon joining in soon .
If we look into the Bible , we can find that there are many instances where it talks of things we never knew of before until today .
Incidentally , is the title of this forum meant to imply that creationism and Intelligent Design are two names for the same thing ? While I agree that they are more similar to each other than to evolution , it troubles me that anyone would believe that they are synonymous . For those that think the title is justified , what about the two beliefs do you find similar enough to class them as the same idea ?
Yet again , Obama proves not to be the gay pride messiah that gay pride proponents thought they were voting for ... `` WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Obama administration on Friday urged a U.S. court to dismiss a lawsuit by gay married couples from Massachusetts who say they were unlawfully denied federal marriage benefits .

Chloe , in the very first post of this thread you failed to disclose what it is about the so-called `` pro-life '' view of women that makes their views superior to the pro-choice view .
3 ) Being gay is immoral in the eyes of God . Taking humans out of consideration , why did God create some animals with both sex organs ( hermaphradites ) , switch sexes ( male to female , or vice versa ) when one sex is dominate , or engage in homosexual activities ? Just wondering if any of the anti-gay activist can answers these . I 'm curious . Thanks !
I hope that we will have had the most informative . intellectually honest and civil discussion possible . And that it serves as an example and benefit to others . Let 's get it on !
An example where both natural selection and mutations work together to enable a creature to survive also results in a loss of genetic information . Consider that flightless bird in the Galapagos Islands , oh , what is it 's name ? I think it is called something like the flightless conrade .
What are the best arguments for/against gun-control ? When I asked this question at http : //p078.ezboard.com/bguncontrol4778 people there seemed to think that gun-control was a good idea . Bush and Kerry both seemed to favor gun-control in the debate , but Kerry seems to believe more strongly in it .
Not all of them .
We must take it upon ourselves to set right and heal and care for all our citizens . It is not a question of rights in my opinion , but a moral obligation .
it ought but it wo n't , at least not the gun fetishists in this forum , who IMHO are prisoners of their ignorance , their fears , their insecurity . They are simply insane and no dialogue is possible with them . They are immune to reason .

600 ? Oh really ? Looks like the following scriptures are vague enough that they could apply to anything and nothing at the same time . Making vague enough comments can easily look prophetic . The fact that there are n't specifics is a key failure in your argument . If the bible was truly prophetic and scientifically accurate , terms that would easily be seen as represenativive of the natural force would be found everywhere , yet they are not . You are talking a little and making it to be far more then it is . Once again , anything vague enough can be taken for anything in any light under any condition .

** Just rece8ived a threat of banning from a 'moderator ' . Why ? Apparently because 1 or more darwinists have complained to him that I refuse to learn about evolution . This , of course , is a complete crock , butr apparently the 'mod ' never bothered to check it out before leaping to do the dawinist 's bidding . The fact is that I know more about 'evolution ' than most of the members , and I never stop searching for web material that will help me to learn more . There is , so far as I am aware , no regulation that says any person posting to the 'evolution ' forum must have , or be in the process of obtaining , a recognised degree in evolutionary biology , genetics , biochemistry , molecular biology , or kindred field of study . The fact that none of the darwinists in this forum is capable of intellibly explaining the basic mechanics behind his/her gene-based , genetic determinist , RMNS hypothesis of evolution 's driving force/cause/mechanism is certainly no fault of mine , or anyone save themselves . That is their problem , and if they can not sell their notion because they can not explain it in empirical terms , that should be their concern and nobody else 's . But for them to try and reverse the situation by p [ retending that their incompetence is my laziness , is not merely ludicrous and ridiculous , it is a scurrilous lie . Which is par for the course and comes with the territory when you are arguing with ideologues , but when you discover that there is someone who , given the responsibility of moderating a forum fairly and impartially , is acting simply as an 'intimidator ' for the darwinists , that 's when you know that the cards are stacked , the dice weighted , sand your voice will soon be smothered . If you hear no more from me , you 'll know why not . If the 'mod ' erases this post before I 'm 'disappeared ' , you wo n't . C'est la vie . ww [ Mike Turner ]
I like your thinking , although I disagree with it . You say that God is the universe . I propose that God is relational . That without a relational god we are truly hopeless . The problem you are running into is that you are trying to imagine god existing within the framework of creation ( universe etc . ) and tying his existence to that . NOw I am going to say something that will really not make sense to you . God existed BEFORE time . Chew on that one a bit . Eternality implies an existence outside of time . And in fact , much of science alludes to this possibility . I certainly could never prove it and do not propose to but would like it if you would consider the implications . As for God communicating to us , there is nothing that prevents that . Especially if you accept the idea that we are imago dei , image bearers of the divine . We are not perfect images but we are rational , emotional , spiritual , beings EF
Would these very same people agree that a similiar choice should have been made about their own existence ?

WASHINGTON - Police officer deaths plunged to their lowest midyear total in 43 years after an unusually deadly year for law enforcement officers , says a report released today by a national police advocacy group . . . .

Correct decision ? I would say this woman ' s mental health was at risk . How devastating to carry a fetus to term and deliver a stillborn or a baby who dies relatively soon . I know , it happened to a friend . Cruel , cruel , cruel .
This is where the competition really occurs . This is why natural selection -- the ability to go on to breed -- on the level of the population is actually non-random .
I was actually hoping to receive the onslaught from the creationists . I considered that post more as bait to begin a logical discussion for evolution vs creationism . I wanted to hear -- from a creationist -- why one can concede to evolution within a species within just 100 years , but can never agree to macroevolution across the span of hundreds of millions of years . It 's tantamount to believing each species of creature now has always been here and has only transformed through microevolution . ( Well , maybe the cockroach . Those things are the best , albeit icky , animal survival machines : P ) Besides , there are many examples of macroevolution which would be brought up as a creationist ignorantly believes this never happens . Of course , the end result would be that the creationist will not concede because s/he can not think logically , which is why they 're a creationist in the first place .

The guy can have an opinion but the ultimate choice is up to the woman who can listen to what the guy says or not , it 's up to her . I believe that is what sinjin was saying .
Nice raising the bar . Fallacies are a creationist 's best friend . You claimed : '' have never shown to add any new structure or even a new part to any existing structure . '' Now you are changing your argument away from structure as new proteins and especially enzymes ( which are proteins ) do n't count .
SS - your implication is that if Christians testify to the efficasy of prayer , then the result is God-derived . If not , why use the word prayer ? Across the human species , we can all use inner strength to fight e.g . illness : Christians and non-Christians alike will have varying degrees of success . That is certainly not evidence that if a Christian prays , that it was a Supreme Being causing a beneficial result . Correct . A human construct . What YOU want it to be , not what God wants it to be . That 's why there are so many flavours of religion . Your mind tells YOU what is convenient and plausible for YOU . And from there you argue that that is proof of the existence of God because you can feel it in mind , soul and body . Such is the folly of wanting and believing . Think outside the box .
lol , and you prove my point ... rationalization for the win
We do n't want to see even one soul lost .
Let 's be honest , it wo n't result in any more or less gun deaths and even if it resulted in more gun deaths it would be worth having the amendment . The 2nd amendment was only created to give citizens a last resort should the government fail us . It may seem like we do n't need that now but one day it really might come in handy and people should n't forget that . I still think incorporation is a load of BS though ... for any amendment . Damn you 14th amendment !

What is your point ? Should we revert to old laws that allow for slavery ? Over the history of mankind we have struggled to understand God . God has revealled part of Himself to us , but it is difficult for the limited mind to know the unlimited mind . The US had laws enabling this ? Does this mean you were n't a democracy then ? When you were a child , and had total awe of your parents , and believed what they told you , were you less of a person then ? Surely you understand that what your parents taught you then , was a part of you growining and becoming an adult . God for instance calls Himself 'Father ' . This is n't because He has 'male sex organs ' but because it is the best way for us to understand His relationship to us . Likewise , the Jews made laws in order to best live according to God 's Will . They did make mistakes , and got bogged down in the law . Jesus came ( as promised by God ) and liberated us from the entrapment we had set for ourselves . Surely you do n't advocate that we should return to a strict observence of Mosaic laws ?
No one was claiming they want 'rights restricted ' because of of bathrooms . He 's either being beligerent by intentionally portraying the analogy as a premise , or incredibly dense . I 'm starting to wonder if it 's the latter . . . .
tactics not motives
Anti-choicers do n't give two whits about life , or really believe in the absolute value of a fetus . This story is a good example of that . I bet a lot of so-called `` pro-lifers '' would support this court 's decision , even though the mother posed no real threat , and she could have miscarried the fetus : For anti-choicers , it 's just about control and power over women . They do n't care about life . ( Except their own . ) This same mother could be a person who did n't have access to pre-natal care . They would n't defend that right either . Because they DO N'T care about the fetus . They do n't care about life . They do n't care about health . They care about power and money and pushing people around . That 's all .

Not only that , to suggest that untold numbers of women would seek illegal abortions is a question-begging claim that has no grounding in history , logic , or reason . It is an unfounded , unproven claim . It is a betrayal to sound judgment to make decisions based upon unfounded predictions into the future .
I think they have more of a chance becasue , while many manage to delude themselves into believing that an unborn child is not a baby , it would be much more difficult to convince yourself that a crying baby is n't a baby . Even in the animal kingdom ( which we are all part of ) you see some animals hesitate to kill the young of their own species . Evne coyotes will not generally kill a pup ( I have even seen a pack of coyoptes pass a domestic pup without killing it , though they could have . I am told this is because of the stubby nose , which shows the coyotes that it is , indeed , a puppy , even though it looks unfamiliar to them ) .

My question is , how can any rational person really believe that what is theorized to have happened 4.3 billion years ago is so reliable as to be beyond questioning .
( emphasis mine - Montalban ) It does n't do this , because proponents of natural selection rule out 'ends ' ... other than survival , and survival simply come about because organisms survive ( hence the tautology of `` Survival of the Fittest '' which Darwin himself felt was a superior phrase to `` Natural Selection '' ) .

Im calling bull on this ! Most of them didnt even have guns so they couldnt be disarmed ! A more farfetched question is the hypothetical proposition of armed Jewish resistance . First , they were not commonly armed even prior to the 1928 Law . Second , Jews had seen pogroms before and had survived them , though not without suffering . They would expect that this one would , as had the past ones , eventually subside and permit a return to normalcy . Many considered themselves `` patriotic Germans '' for their service in the first World War . These simply were not people prepared to stage violent resistance . Nor were they alone in this mode of appeasement . The defiance of `` never again '' is not so much a warning to potential oppressors as it is a challenge to Jews to reject the passive response to pogrom . Third , it hardly seems conceivable that armed resistance by Jews ( or any other target group ) would have led to any weakening of Nazi rule , let alone a full scale popular rebellion ; on the contrary , it seems more likely it would have strengthened the support the Nazis already had . Their foul lies about Jewish perfidy would have been given a grain of substance . To project backward and speculate thus is to fail to learn the lesson history has so painfully provided . The simple conclusion is that there are no lessons about the efficacy of gun control to be learned from the Germany of the first half of this century . It is all too easy to forget the seductive allure that fascism presented to all the West , bogged down in economic and social morass . What must be remembered is that the Nazis were master manipulators of popular emotion and sentiment , and were disdainful of people thinking for themselves . There is the danger to which we should pay great heed . Not fanciful stories about Nazi 's seizing guns .
I already told you , fill the holes in your arguement and maybe you would n't complain so much .
And to make such associations with tyranny is exagerated to say the least .
`` Modern '' Atheists have only been around for a short time . In biblical times , Atheists were people who beleved in God ( s ) , but did n't believe He/they intervened with life on Earth . How and why do you think the terms have changed , and what are the similarities between tham ?
To complain when he demolishes your flimsy semantic constructs with his superior analytical and debating skills , and call on support from outside , when you were the one who insisted on a head to head challenge is no less ironic for its predictability . It appears you are only now dimly aware of the enormity of the miscalcuation you made in provoking this challenge . Get on with it . Less the caviling and elision , if you please .
First off , I do n't see how people can live with themselves after killin ' something you know will grow into a human child . Especially if it has a heartbeat . Another thing , if you give teenagers the option to have an escape goat for getting pregnant at an early age . They 'll never learn ! Life is life and you take whats handed to you . If you try and change that , you get a screwed up place ( hince the world ) . But thats just my opinion ... ..
And besides , why get so defensive about polygamy anyway ? It 's not like it 's some horrible thing to be compared to .
From a secular point of view there is no difference between a 30 year old woman and a 10 week old fetus because both are just blobs of tissue , neither has any more inherent value than a piece of dirt or wart on a monkey . There is no meaningful moral difference between a blob of person or a blob that you jump on at the lake at summer camp . This is really a wonderful view of human life do n't you think ? Just think of all the wonderful fruit that can come from this root of thinking .
This is an answer based on either BS or ignorance . Those without money can use Medicare or Medicaid to virtually pay for the entire pregnancy . WIC also supplements your own feeding IIRC with proteins and calcium products . I 've known several people ( including hard core conservatives ) who 've had to go this route 'because they could n't afford a pregnancy ' . And if your morality/ ethics prevents you from taking gov't funding , think of it as stuff you already paid for with taxes ( now and later ) , you 're just getting some of what you put in back . Furthermore , there are several agencies that would easily pay for all your needs provided you put the child up for adoption .
I think England is a lost cause to be honest . Whenever someone injures an intruder who intends to do them harm , on their own property , and gets sentenced to several years in prision while the criminal gets off free , something is seriously wrong with your society .
The second part of the second amendment speaks of the people . What did the founders mean when they referred to the people ? Some would like to think that they meant each adult individual . However , this understanding is not consistent with the way the word is used in other parts of the constitution . In the preamble of the Constitution , the founders refer to themselves as 'We the People . ' Obviously not each adult individual in America was involved in writing the Constitution . The first amendment speaks of 'the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances . ' The word 'assemble ' lets us know that such a right is exercised by the people collectively and not by an individual person .
Yes I believe in strict government regulation of business . I see the agenda behind the question .
Eighteen and pregnant , Sycloria Williams went to an abortion clinic outside Miami and paid $ 1,200 for Dr. Pierre Jean-Jacque Renelique to terminate her 23-week pregnancy . Three days later , she sat in a reclining chair , medicated to dilate her cervix and otherwise readied for the procedure . Only Renelique did n't arrive in time . According to Williams and the Florida Department of Health , she went into labor and delivered a live baby girl . What Williams and the Health Department say happened next has shocked people on both sides of the abortion debate : One of the clinic 's owners , who has no medical license , cut the infant 's umbilical cord . Williams says the woman placed the baby in a plastic biohazard bag and threw it out . Police recovered the decomposing remains in a cardboard box a week later after getting anonymous tips .
Lets say that at some point in the near future a world was found on which lived beings with an intelligence and self awareness like our own along with society , religion and culture . These Beings have a religion that contains a story that says their world was created by a deity 3000 years after when literal Genesists say the earth was created ( ie . if now , this would make their universe 3000 years old ) . When the religious members of each race discover the others beliefs , it causes much consternation as both claim to have the truth of God on their side . How would each group of literal belivers react to the other ? the Genesists say the Beings story can not be correct because the Bible is the word of God and it records 6000 years of history . The Beings can not accept the history of Genesis as it claims th universe existed 3000 years before their holy text records the creation of the universe and their first members by their God . Both claim to have the evidence of the word of God in their holy books , and their respective histories are truth . But their truth 's disagree ... ... .. who is `` right '' who has the real `` truth '' ?
Nobody advocates abortion , Maximus , they advocate choice . Being in favor of choice for rape victims is not the same as thinking that children of rape should have been killed . I would not have a problem expressing my position on choice in instances of rape in the presence of a child of rape any more than I would have a problem advocating choice for pregnancies of consensual sex in the presence of myself , a child of consensual sex .
Had it not been for Activist judges in Mass . and and activist mayor in Sodom ( SF ) trolling for votes gay marriage would not even be and issue ... ...
I can not prove the latter , though with the former , I can demonstrate some parts of the Bible which are inaccurate , and just plain wrong .
Hillarious . I remember seeing that a while back . That 's liberals for you , the laws they propose are for the 'peasants ' , not for them to obey . They , afterall , are better suited for making decisions like these than you . You need them to think for you.. to care for you.. cradle to grave . You may also recall that famed anti-gunner Rosie O'Donnell has armed bodyguards but says you should n't have guns yourself . You can not be trusted , afterall . And who was that writer who shot the kid in the hand that was swimming in his pool late one night ? Carl something . Another anti-gunner who preaches 'do as I say , not as I do ' . Liberals.. LOL !
But , what if , everything in the universe was originally `` placed '' pretty much where we see it now ?
We would expect to find no signs of life within this layer ( no tracks or burrows , and no signs of growing plant life such as paleosols are tree roots ) .

Just thought I 'd share about secular rights for gays ... not `` special rights '' but equal rights ... No , homosexuals do not have the same rights as heterosexuals do . We can not serve in the military because of our sexual orientation . We do not all have protections against being fired because of our sexual orientation . As for the secular rights , I do n't think this is right . From a religious standpoint , I 've never seen more ignorance , hatred or twisted lies put into words as I have on this board from some of the folks who are Christians . Personally , I do n't see the difference between what is `` good '' and what is `` evil '' when it comes to religion on here . I 've seen satanists say nicer things than what has been written here . If this is your idea of what is good , I want no part of it . As far as the two , secular rights and religious rights , it seems that although the constitution has a freedom of religion clause in it , faith based people can not and will not separate the two out making the separation clause invalid ... what 's the point in that ?
I do n't know about that listed range , however . The maximum effective range listed is 800 meters . Then again that might be wrong and these short action calibers might have a 1,500 meter effective range , meaning that the claimed abilities of the .50 BMG are mediocre in comparison .
Do me a favor . Write , in your own words , two paragraphs . One explaining the electromagnetic spectrum ( and the visible spectrum 's place in it ) , and one discussing rods and cones in the eyes .

Thus , for pro-lifers , human beings hold rights by virtue of what they are ( human beings ) , not by virtue of what they can do ( think or speak ? ) . Thus , for pro-lifers the only question that is important in the abortion debate is whether the embryo is a human being . And , so long as this question is at least debatable ( as it clearly is ) , then the pro-life view exercises caution .
The Breyer-Sotomayor-Ginsburg dissent questioned why some restrictions would be acceptable but not the Chicago handgun ban :
Supreme Court Justice Stevens also made a similar criticism . `` With emphasis on the word 'genuine , ' Stevens said that 'a genuine judicial conservative ' would not have inserted the Court into the 'political thicket ' of the gun rights debate as Scalia had done . ''
Ed Todeschini , a Human Rights Campaign volunteer , accused Saddleback in particular of helping propagate what he called misinformation about the Supreme Court ruling , including that gay marriage would have to be taught to kindergartners . A message seeking comment left at the church 's main office , which was closed Sunday , was not immediately returned . `` They told such obvious lies . They used their lies to deceive the public , '' Todeschini said of the church , which gained national attention in August when its pastor , Rick Warren , brought Obama and McCain together to discuss their religious faith . The two candidates embraced during an often-contentious presidential campaign .
No , I dont think so .
Hm ... And I allowed to bring the amendments into this ?
According to who ? Though it may not have been practiced to its fullness , it in no way follows that all men are not created equal .
Logical truths simply follow from the way in which concepts are defined . 1 + 1 = 2 is true and always true because of the meaning of ( 1 ) , the + sign , and = . They are not dependent on matter , nor are they dependent on god . It is true regardless of whether there is any matter which the number 1 can be used to describe , or regardless of whether any conscious being exists which can think it . These are not concepts created by man , but discovered by him . I am not sure what you mean here by derived . If you mean created , they are certainly not created by the physical universe , they are true regardless of whether any universe exists at all . Yes this may contradict the view of some `` strict '' naturalists , who claim that the physical , material world is all that exists , but they simply deny that things like the `` law of non-contradiction '' exist at all . If you say it exists , they will ask you to point to its physical manifestation .
I personally opted for abortion over adoption for two main reasons . 1 . I had no intention to get pregnant . I faithfully took the pill , and by fiance always used a condom . Despite these precautions , we experienced that `` percentage failure '' of contraception . I found out I was pregnant several weeks in , and my fiance and I made our decision together . 2 . We had no money . We are both in college ( finishing up our Masters degrees in a few weeks now ) , and have enormous student loan fees as well as numerous other monetary problems . Right now the most we can do is finish up school and pay to keep our apartment . Pregnancy is a very expensive thing ( which is why I find it ridiculous that pro-lifers offer adoption as if it was such a great option , because adoption itself can be free , but they do n't take into consideration everything before adoption ) , and we could n't afford to have a child to give up for adoption let alone actually raise one . To add to the obvious costs of pregnancy , there is also the loss of pay as I would not be able to work ( I 'm a geologist - this involves quite a bit of strenuous outdoors work ) , which would even further affect us . Hope everything was clear to you , if you have any questions , just ask . Those were my reasons , and there are many many more that apply to different women in different ways .
Do you believe that if a woman became pregnant because she was a product of incest , that she should have an abortion ? Yes . Maybe or depends . No . Do you believe that if a woman became pregnant because she was a product of rape , that she should have an abortion ? Yes . Maybe or depends . No . If a woman 's life is threatened by the pregnancy of the baby , should she have an abortion ? Yes . Maybe or depends . No .
Well you never know cause your pro life and for the death penalty .

Since I was there , I 'll give you an objective rundown : 1 . ) Dawkins did n't `` crash '' anything . He watched the movie without saying a word and participated in a Q & amp ; A session with the producer at the end -- a session that the producer deliberately started . 2 . ) There was no `` sneaking '' on any level . PZ , his daughter , and I all registered our names over the internet for the event and selected the option to have up to three guests come with us . We registered our real names , our real addresses , our real telephone numbers , and our real emails , and we all received confirmation emails approving our registration . 3 . ) What possible reason did they have to deny PZ a viewing of the film ? Dawkins and I pressed the producer Mathis on this issue , and he said it was about money -- he wanted PZ to come back in a month and pay his $ 10 . But this makes no sense . PZ was paid $ 1,200 for his interview . They thanked him for the interview in the credits . If money was a concern , they could have paid him $ 1,190 and given him a free reservation . Just the fact that he was in the film should have been enough to warrant a seat at a pre-screening event . This all begs the question : What in God 's name are they so bloody afraid of ?
OK. Evolution claims nothing that is outside the realm of the knowable

ok , honestly . i know 3 girls ( ages ranging from 13-22 ) that have had an abortion . It is entirely their choice , no one else 's . Who cares about your opinion ? They do n't rely on whether or not YOU think its right to have an abortion or not . They make the choice . And yes , i am catholic but i STRONGLY disagree with many of the beliefs of my church . Its no place for them to intervene . Thank you .
First of all , it 's not a precedent . this is the seventh or eighth state where a higher court has found anti-gay discrimination in marriage unconstitutional . Secondly , when so many rulings go in this direction , it can hardly be called `` lawlessness '' . It 's a call for lawful , constitutional interpretation of statutes . It takes extraordinary intellectual dishonesty to pretend there is some `` agenda '' at work . These decisions are the consequence of two things : our long history of rationally applying those silly words about equality that folks smarter than this generation of politicians put in the Constitution AND a long-term correction of the misunderstandings of what homosexuality IS and what its consequences are . I know you do n't personally believe it , but there is nothing wrong with us .
What are you afraid of , Trebor ? ? The whole world wants to know why you keep avoiding this question : According to your own Jewish Tanakh , is God the Creator of the heavens and earth , and man ? Will he give a pertinent answer or evade it again ? ? I 'm betting he wo n't answer the question .
and that our genes control nothing because they are merely tools that are under the influence of the body .
Actually you could look at this issue in several different ways.Lets start with welfare.Lets say the mother of a newborn who is responsible to finacially and physically take care of her child gets on state aid and agrees to not take child support from the father if he chooses to *opt out*Okay thats fine and dandy but if you think the goverment is going to support HIS child bucause he chooses not to , well HAHAHA YOU HAD BETTER THINK AGAIN ! Anyways things will NOT be equal until a man can actually carry and give birth to a child.Comparring the right to choose abortion and the right to choose not to pay support are completely two different issue that are not comparable.A women has to risk her possible life long health to either choose pregnancy/birth OR abortion a man does NOT risk either in his choice to support or not.This issue does n't even touch on abortion for rape/incest or health reasons of the mother and or fetus . seems to me a deadbeat dad is using the pro-choice position to get out of paying support when HIS body is n't even in the issue .
No I believe it was the cops AND the woman . The cops could have done something else beside tase her and she should have listened .
What specific species and what did they evolve to .
Making abortion illegal is an unrighteous law . Were n't there laws forbidding African Americans from sitting in the front of a bus ? Was n't that law broken ?
So as you can see , petrification is out of the question for proving evolution .
Really , so California is just a peachy crime free place because of its strict firearms laws ? What about New York ? But wait ! Do n't forget good ol Washington DC ! Their crime rate is lower than Bush 's approval rating because of their strict firearm laws ! Of course they are going to have a higher rate of firearms death , but they 're obviously going to have a lower rate of everything else ( criminal related ) death . In the end , Its lower .
Uh , huh . About a week ago they put Malvo or his muslim partner to death after all this time for the 'sniper slayings ' they advertised as `` two white males in a white car '' obviously white , right wing extremists . OOOOOPS !
Do you see the other cities pushing for outrageous standards like NYC ?
The number of deaths wouldn´t be lower in any way . After all , countries like Rwanda and Sierra Leone don´t have a working governmental strucure so couldn´t enforce such a ban .
Or another example of how denying homosexuals access access to anything but the same legal institutions as heterosexuals will never result in equality . The domestic partner registry just is n't sufficient ; why would anyone think that creating a similar marriage-substitute will be equal ?
yet many debaters spend more posts arguing what is evolution and why youre wrong to call such-and-such evolution , and not enough time actually discussing how the facts , evidence and theories fit into the bigger picture
They want the kids to understand that the theory of evolution certainly has a wide body of evidence behind it , but it also has a substantial amount of conjecture tacked on .
One point I would like to make is that rockets are not legal to own , unless they are demil-ed , and the same goes for tanks and aircraft . They are called Destructive Devices under the NFA , and are regulated heavily .
While ALL gods can not be shown to exist , it can be pretty conclusively shown that certain gods do not exist . For example , pretend there was a religion ...
Why should the courts be concerned with preventing a religious concept ?
It is curious how lately christians have been telling me that being an aethiest ( which I am ) , is a religion . The above post is a good example of this misunderstanding . First - the lack of a religion is NOT a religion . Second , I 'll simply disagree with your statement . Observation , reasoning , and deduction is exactly what leads me to understand that there is no god , and that religion is merely an attempt to explain what we have not yet been able to reason out . As our knowledge increases , our need for a god decreases , and we can begin to see through the emotional fog of religion that keeps us in ignorance .

Dae , I hear you and have said many times that I 'm not a Laissez Faire type guy . My point was that the ability to accumulate capital ( personal property ) is the reason that the US is the country it is today . Sure there 's a place for the govt . in ANY system , including this one . However , the reason our country has done so well , for so long and the reason we 're so productive as workers is the fact that we have a right to participate in the system and accumulate wealth . Yes , the govt . will be needed to provide certain services . Yes , it is necessary to have rules , taxes , and a govt . to provide security and facilitate trade and etc ... I 've never said any different . However , there 's a difference between saying that and saying that everything good has come through the govt . That 's not true and if it was the USSR ( or Germany ) would rule the world today . The private sector is what drives the govt . and the economy . Without the Private Sector , there would n't be any govt . or tax money or tax payers to fund all the wonderful things that the govt . does . But too much govt . and the private sector whithers and with it , the govt . as well .

So how would you make a study that shows the benefits of gun ownership ? I don´t think there is any way to do this . It 's already been done to some degree . Do your own research . Sounds like liberal XXXX . Fighting hunger ... tztz No kidding . That 's your U.N. for you , 'cradle to grave ' socialism . Do you think this resistance got their most useful weapons out of a normal store ? Please don´t try such arguments without knowing about European history . Try reading this part again . Also , I did n't write the article . But , let me also state that I 'll 'try ' whatever arguments I see fit . The number of deaths wouldn´t be lower in any way . After all , countries like Rwanda and Sierra Leone don´t have a working governmental strucure so couldn´t enforce such a ban . Is that right ? I 'll tell you what , come at me with a machete and see how close you can get ? Why is gun control more likely to increase crime that reducing it ? It emboldens criminals to commit crimes against what they perceive to be easy targets . How often do pawn shops get robbed ? Not very , as everyone I 've ever been in , the employees all carry a sidearm . Nice try , but DOJ statistics bear this out . Mind telling us about your own `` research '' ? John Lott and others have done extensive research on the issue using DOJ and other statistics . But , it 's irrelevent to liberals like yourself who 'd rather base their opinions on hysterical emotions rather than facts . So , keep relying on Michael Moore and others for your 'research ' . You are right about the people who would give uop their gun . It would be the law-abiding ones , but you are saying this as if they would do something immoral . Huh ? It was obvious that this stupid argument comes up again . Bosnia : People there occasionaly owned guns , but what could a few familiy fathers do when the army comes and shoots everyone . Not much . Oh ? You lived in Bosnia ? Hmm.. I 'm glad a coward like you was n't around when the British 'army ' came calling on the Colonists who were 'family fathers ' . Afghanistan : Do you really think that the Afghanis would have had the same chances against the Soviets without Stingers or CIA training showing them how to plan terrorist attacks ? Sure , without gun control the second-mightiest army would have never attacked Afghanistan ... The Afghans were causing all kinds of grief before we got involved . So , yeah , the Stingers , etc . were a help , but not the deciding factor . Warsaw : That is your most stupid argument and it really makes me angry . In the ghetto of Warsaw , there WAS an armed uprise . The result ? The Germans massacred thousands as revenge . And if they had more guns , maybe the Germans simply had bombed the whole ghetto with their planes . Yeah , it 's stupid to defend yourself . Maybe they were n't as cowardly as yourself and did n't want to die on their knees like you would ? Oh , the Germans did shell and bomb the Ghetto as I recall . And here I thought you were an expert on European history ? Please don´t you ever bring on any arguments against gun-control by showing examples from the 3 . Reich . Gun-control got nothing to do with the increase of Hitler´s power or the way that WW2 went . I 'll bring up whatever I want to , XXXXX . So , cram it ! Once gun-control was established by the Nazis , how were his opponents suppose to overthrow him had they decided to ? Do like you , and put flowers in the barrels of the Storm Trooper 's Mausers ? Give peace a chance ? Yeah , that 'd work ! Also , nowhere in there did it say anything about the 'way WW2 went'.. you 're just making stuff up . The rest of your post I maybe reply to later , but it is always exhausting to write against any uncited and unproven claims ... What you find 'exhausting ' is your inability to discredit any of John Lott 's points . All you have is your irrational fear of firearms and emotional distortions . Nevermind the revisionist history .

I disagree with your decision . It would have been better if you sucked it up and kept the kid . Even if you ended up on the street at least you would n't have killed anyone . I dont mean to be judgemental , and I 'm not calling you a bad person , but what you did was wrong .
Because they knew full well that the bulk of the confiscated weapons never came from the United States !
Mass . lawmakers delay vote on gay-marriage ban http : //news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060713/ ... ghts_gays_dc_1 The anti-gay family groups ( mass resistance , etc . ) are are not happy about this move . Time is on our side , as more time passes more and more people are in support of full marriage equality .
What i think is very un-neccessary is the fact that religion has caused so much death and destruction in the name of god . I do n't have to be religious to know killing is wrong , i 'm smart . But tell that to the knights in the crusades or blasphemers who were burned at the stake . That is not understanding as preached by most religious of any faith .
NOw I am going to say something that will really not make sense to you . God existed BEFORE time . Chew on that one a bit . Eternality implies an existence outside of time . And in fact , much of science alludes to this possibility . I certainly could never prove it and do not propose to but would like it if you would consider the implications .
If it were up to you , what would background checks look for to see if someone is qualified to own a firearm ? Remember , the votes in this poll are public . So if you wish to keep your votes anonymous , I suggest you do n't vote here .

Now the word of the Lord came to me saying , `` Before I formed you in the womb I knew you , and before you were born I consecrated you ; I have appointed you a prophet to the nations . ''
The thing that breaks my heart even more is knowing that the babies are being mercilessly hurt in the process . People do n't want to believe this , but it 's true ! Planned Parenthood actually states the following on their website : `` We know for sure that the embryo or fetus can not perceive pain in the nearly 99 percent of all abortions that occur before the 20th week of pregnancy . It is even possible that a fetus is unable to perceive pain at any time during pregnancy . '' Are you kidding me ? ! ! ! Where 's your research to back that one up ? ! That sounds more like a wild guess to me ! So what about the other 1 percent ? Why is it that `` nearly 99 percent '' you are sure ca n't perceive pain ? And then to actually say it is possible they ca n't perceive it any time during pregnancy ? ! Yes because you know , the nervous system does n't actually develop until AFTER birth !
A man , a state , a church , a religian that can not change can not grow .
What in the Hell does evolution have to do with people doing bad things ? I am a believer in creation by God and have never heard such drivel . BOY-HOWDY ! ! !
Yeah . Banning them will only send us back to the medieval times when everyone used SWORDS .
And I just say that it would be unjust and unfair of you to force metaphysical belief systems of your own which constitute religious belief upon your follows who may believe otherwise than you . Get pregnant and treat your fetus as a full person if you wish , nobody will force you to abort it . Let others follow their own beliefs differing or the same . Otherwise you attempt to obtain justice by doing injustice .
Because most people are Christian .
Jews and homosexuals and Slavs are people , ( I do n't see any debate professing otherwise ) . They were seperate and independent from the womb and were capable of surviving without someone else 's uterus at the point in which they were murdered .
A woman owns her head , just as she owns the rest of her body . If you accept women as legitimate self-owners and not a slave caste , both the legality of abortion and the illegality of steamrolling their heads follows .
Anyway , you 're going way overboard with what marijuana does to people .
Please do n't be offended by this , my family is far from perfect , my parents gave birth to 5 accidents ! One was planned . To this day I do n't know why my mother did n't just go on the pill instead of relying on stoneage condoms ... but as soon as I raise the issue she tells me to shut up or she 'll send me to an orphanage ! ( just kiddn ) Also , the fact that the world today has turned sex into a `` hobby '' does n't really help matters . I do n't mean to sound biased here or take sides but if people were to have a more religious view ( like it used to be years ago ) then there would n't be a sex mad world ( and therefore , relationships would be taken more seriously and kids would be planned ) . Not saying that you have to become Islamic or anything , just stating a fact .

They say there is no proof of god so I do n't believe for sure that there is one . They also know you ca n't prove there is no god so they are not convinced one way or the other . It 's a lot better logic than you tried to use . Maybe you should just respect others ' beliefs and realize that they 've actually thought about their decisions and can do more than just quote a book and other people . You should be able to post quotes but you should actually put a little of your own knowledge and thought into posts as well . I doubt this will have any effect on you at all , but oh well I tried .
None that prove one became another . Of course dinos , birds , and fish exist and scientist study them -or their remains as with dinos . Of course some dinosaurs are still alive like alligators , monitor lizards etc .
the problem is that the BIBLE and evolution are mutually exclusive ( at least the inerrancy ) . and as far as modern day christianity is concerned , if the bible fails , christianity fails , and if christianiy fails , God fails . the conflict is almost inseparable ( unless of course some doctrinal gymnastics are involved )
question two : I believe that many people that are against abortion are working on ending hunger . I also believe that those who are working to end hunger , most likey have their hands so full with the task that their time , energy and focus cant be spent on ending abortion . Thats my view .
But since selection works on the level of the whole organism , it can not stop the loss of information due to mutation . Its like trying to fix a broken-down tv set with a hammer .
We 're all addicted to something . I had a tough time recently giving up coffee . It was interfering with my life .
`` We call in the doctor to save us from death  Yeah , but fetuses and the terminally ill do not call the doctor to save themselves from death . That is the fallacy of Chesterton .
It 's one or the other . If animals change via structuralism then it must somehow be shown how a monkey could change into a human by a mere change of environment .
Why you quoted me is questionable . What I posted was merely a series of mathematical equations proving that Hovind is completely full of **** . How you consider mathematical equations `` mockery '' I do n't know , but more likely , you did not bother to watch the video .
What about the fossils ? How did they form ? To turn a bone into a fossil , it has to be buried fast and put under pressure , or esle it will rot .

What the theory of evolution states is that monkeys and apes came from a common ancestor , and that humans are apes from a taxonomy point of view . While there are 'gaps ' in knowledge , I suspect if you did a study about what we actually do know about evolution , and human evolution in specific , you would be amazed at what we DO know .
I did a few searches using random words and found that the trend seams to be downward on most of them .

I found this : `` Public opinion polls show that Americans strongly support licensing laws . A nationwide poll conducted in May of 2001 found that 85 % of respondents- including 73 % of gun owners- favored laws requiring handgun purchasers to obtain a permit before buying a handgun . '' http : //www.lcav.org/content/licensin ... purchasers.pdf
Most often the Christians that do question evolution they question Macro-evolution also known as speciation ( depending on what definition of speciation you use ) , which is the concept that at certain times evolution makes huge jumps in genetic shifts that result in new species ( an over simplification and there are many theories in specie formation ) .

It 's just feeding off of the mother .
And anger leads to hate . We can all quote Star Wars if we want to . Thing is that it applies to atheists too . It 's the classic thing , people raised in a harsh , ostensibly religious , environment are scared of the image of God portrayed to them by nuns , or pastors or imams . Because fear can not sustain faith , once they leave that environment they fall away . Then they become angry with God for , as they claim , not existing . This leads them to hatred of those who do believe , who they see as the same ones responsible for their harsh upbringing . Come on , let 's all play cod psychology
i dont care about seperation of church and state , the U.S. was based on the Bible and the Christian religion . If you want to flee from America so yo can get married then go ahead , if it makes you happy .
is n't it a good feeling wake up , log on to the internet , and see your theory smoked ?
God does n't take away sinful desires . You 've never had sinful desires ? I know I have . People assume that when you become a Christian some manner of shield gets put up around you and shields you from `` worldly '' things . I believe that 's wrong , I actually believe that life as a Christian is very hard . We often pawn it off as the end of our troubles to `` convert '' people . I do n't believe it .
Stabbing yourself is not ok , but that does n't mean it should be illegal .

So how do `` Police powers , government oversight , economy , the rights of the people '' account for the lower homicide rates among other developed nations ? If you have an actual argument to make then make it . Otherwise , stop trying to muddy the waters .
However that is beside the point . I would normally agree with you on other medical procedures , because of these reasons . This is an exception , as I have stated above . This is the case where parents will act more immature by either forcing their daughter to have or to not have the abortion against her wishes .

What interest would a state that does n't recognize gay marriage in the first place have in allowing gay divorce ?
Since you pretend to be speaking from a position of authority , one hopes that you have actually done some research , otherwise you are being dishonest . I know what I 'm talking about .

The sticker was found to be unconstitutional because it violated the second prong of the Lemon Test . I suspect that you do n't know what that is . Anyway , the 11th Circuit reversed .
Oh so now the first post I ever made is getting some replies . Figures it would happen almost 3 months in . Post away here if you wish but there is another post of the same title in the Religion thread that has a lot of discussion in it concerning what is probably the strongest discrepancy in the Bible . `` Ezekiel predicted Babylon would conquer Egypt and was wrong ''
Its true .
It 's not an `` arrogant assumption '' to point out that religious faith involves making a `` leap in the dark '' - it 's a metaphor that attempts to illustrate the facts of the case .
How did the first cell come about ?
As a side not , rationalization is a sign of addiction .

In fact , it could be said that the man has the only independent perspective .
I have never heard that any form of pre-conception contraception were equaled to abortion . Rather , I 've heard it expressed that any sex that is not intended for procreation is sinful . A bit of difference . And Ryuuichi , a decision not to have children is something that a 17 year old is far from ready to make . The reversibility of the procedure is questionable . As for abortion , it is generally a one time effect and does not lead to permanent infertility ( except perhaps as a rare unwanted side effect ) .
I hate to break it to you but the people have less confidence in the monstosity of 2000+ pages that no one knows what 's in it not could anyone even begin to tell you bullet points . Take your spam else where like the DU or the KOS where it will be received with koolaid salutes .
The basic argument is that stuff , from the universe , to people , to eyeballs , to DNA , is too complex to have `` just happened '' . Someone , ( and they wo n't say God , cause their not trying to be religious here , oh no ... ) must have designed them .
Your point here would be stronger if you yourself did not constantly engage in the same tactics that you accuse others of doing . I have answered nearly all of the points you ever made to me ( I might have missed one or two during your period of multiple replies ) . You , however , have very often engaged in the very behavior toward me that you accuse those on the pro-choice side of engaging in .
Federal judges tentatively ruled on Monday that California must reduce the number of inmates in its overcrowded prison system by up to 40 percent to stop a constitutional violation of prisoners ' rights . Implementing the court 's ruling would result in up to 58,000 prisoners being released , Cate said , describing it as a threat to public safety .

How is that a affect of deterrence ? Deterrence works by preventing people through the fear of consequences . A dead man has no fears . Furman Vs. Georgia , where the supreme court specifically noted that there is not a single piece of conclusive evidence that the penalty is a effective deterrent .
This is why religion may not survive the future . People like Arch are setting it as opposed to science and in that position it will be doomed to fail . The only hope is if the nuts stop making it in to an adversarial situation . Arch is doing nothing but distorting the very thing he holds so dear , but that is already clear to anyone who knows his work here .
Fear of restrictions spurs huge boost in gun sales Unfortunately Democrats have a credibility problem . Many Pro-gun Democrats have been elected , and America is giving them a chance , but apparently they do not believe Obama because of his past Anti-gun support and votes . However Ms. Feinstein 's comments about waiting for the correct timing to bring up gun control did not help the creditability problem either . I guess only time will tell .
LOL , you mean it honors the privacy rights of gun traffickers and those with illegally obtained firearms .

If science deals with how information is gathered , different ways of analyzing , and different hypothesis , then it involves worldviews . The base for the worldview of a sizable part of the population should not be excluded . Maybe in Saddam Hussien 's Iraq , maybe in communist Russia , but not in the United States .

You believe this .
Atheists feel that their views are more than a denial of a God ; for them , atheism is also way to find new purpose and meaning in life without confining themselves , or their beliefs , to a set of rules . Quick fix Comparative Religions teacher Cherie McGinn has always been aware of atheism among her students , but says that it is often a temporary belief . McGinn feels atheism can often be a `` quick fix '' for students who are still searching or need a way to declare their independence . `` It 's easier to say 'I do n't believe in God ' than to say , 'I believe in this , '' McGinn explains . According to McGinn , most people who claim to be atheists are probably agnostic , or people who do not believe God 's existence can be proved either way . `` It takes a strong level of commitment and understanding to be a true atheist , '' says McGinn .
I agree . Time will tell if the cells are as effective as embryonic stem cells , and it seems on the surface , they well might be . Except . These stem must be donated by pregnant women . Amniocentesis , while pretty darn safe , is not without risk . First , the pregnant mother must donate the cells . The risk to the fetus is not zero . When we already have a zero risk procedure from cells that are going to be disposed of anyway . In any event , I am sure some nut job with an extremely skewed sense of morality will find a way to call this procedure immoral in some way .
No Ted Kennedy is not a fundie but Vitter is . For God sake the pope is a nazi and a fundie .

Once again , archie ca n't refute the message , so he pathetically attacks the messenger . Arch , in MY opinion , you and your ilk are as dangerous a threat to America as the terrorists who have openly vowed to destroy us .

Anyone displaying the level of paranoid thinking displayed in the above post should be a natural for a senior NRA position , or committal .

Thanks , but choosing a gun will be one of the last steps . I would certainly practice and train if I were to go through with it , and I 'm pretty well versed in the pro 's and con 's of various guns . I usually dress in loose clothes with shirt untucked so I could in theory conceal a large gun . But a fullsize 1911 is a bit much for me now . One thing that I wonder about is this , the way I dress , many people say I look like slacker , stoner , choose your GEN-X stereotype , I have oversize ear piercings etc . Even though I am college educated and have a respectable job , albeit one where I 'm not requred to dress up , I wonder how others would react if they caught a glimpse of my holster , or the outline of the gun could be seen through my shirt . How many people out there would panic if they saw me ? Would anybody out there feel better if they knew that people around them were carrying ? Worse ?
God did n't write the Bible . People wrote it to the best of their understanding . They can be mistaken in their understanding .
Leaders of the campaign to outlaw same-sex marriage in California are warning businesses that have given money to the state 's largest gay rights group they will be publicly identified as opponents of traditional unions unless they contribute to the gay marriage ban , too . ProtectMarriage.com , the umbrella group behind a ballot initiative that would overturn the California Supreme Court decision that legalized gay marriage , sent a certified letter this week asking companies to withdraw their support of Equality California , a nonprofit organization that is helping lead the campaign against Proposition 8 . `` Make a donation of a like amount to ProtectMarriage.com which will help us correct this error , '' reads the letter . `` Were you to elect not to donate comparably , it would be a clear indication that you are in opposition to traditional marriage . ... The names of any companies and organizations that choose not to donate in like manner to ProtectMarriage.com but have given to Equality California will be published . '' The letter was signed by four members of the group 's executive committee : campaign chairman Ron Prentice ; Edward Dolejsi , executive director of the California Catholic Conference ; Mark Jansson , a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ; and Andrew Pugno , the lawyer for ProtectMarriage.com . A donation form was attached . The letter did not say where the names would be published . The unusual appeal reflects the increasing tension surrounding the tight race over Proposition 8 , which would change the California Constitution to limit marriage to a man and a woman . In recent days , both sides in the debate have accused their opponents of threatening their respective campaign volunteers and misleading voters.Calif . gay marriage ban backers target businesses So , evidently now `` blackmail '' is a `` traditional family value '' ? ? ? I do n't think these people have any shame ...
Scott Roeder is guilty of murder and so should be punished accordingly . However , what about all the murders that happen every day regarding the unborn ? ? Justice should work both ways . Unfortunately we have a government that dictates what justice is and is not .
There is considerable confusion about the legal theory underlying the `` right to keep and bear arms '' . This is a brief outline for a clarification of the discussion of this issue . > ( 1 ) The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not establish the right to keep and bear arms . None of the provisions of the Constitution establish any `` natural '' rights . They recognize such rights , but the repeal of such provisions would not end such rights . Such rights were considered by many of the Framers as obvious or `` self-evident '' , but they were immersed in the prevailing republican thought of the day , as expressed in the writings of Locke , Montesquieu , Rousseau , Madison , Hamilton , and others , which discussed `` natural rights '' in some detail . Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights . That has turned out to have been a good idea > ( 2 ) The right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government . This was clearly the understanding and intent of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution and was a long-established principle of English common law at the time the Constitution was adopted , which is considered to be a part of constitutional law for purposes of interpreting the written Constitution .
A taste of what could be our future if the left has its way .
Coming from a person who used to believe in more gun controls ( myself ) , I 'd like to say this post really sums up all the reasons I 've changed my views on gun controls . Not only do they not work the way they are intended to , they make the constitution work the way it was intended to .
I think it 's a stretch to take a genetic definition of human life to count as a moral definition of personhood because then we must admit non-persons such as cells , organs , tumours , etc to personhood . It 's better to define people formally as well as ontologically , unless we want to define things as their constitutive elements .

I 'm not Canadian , but I suspect you greatly underestimate the amount of under-the-radar opposition and frustration about gay marriage in your country . Polls often do n't give an accurate picture of the full situation . You have a significantly liberal govt and liberal media that even goes so far as to stifle and prevent free speech on this issue . I 've read the views of many religious people in Canada , and a lot of them feel that they are truly being persecuted and oppresed by tha lack of free speech your govt . gives them on this issue . One reason it appears `` dead '' is that your govt . stifles free speech about this issue . You 've lost religious freedom in an overboard attempt to provide `` freedom '' in another area . You should have found a way to have both .
It does seem like several of them have been particularly nasty lately . Maybe they are getting a pay cut from the groups they shill for or something .

Creature 's picture irks Board of Ed member BY ICESS FERNANDEZ The Wichita Eagle State Board of Education member Connie Morris took exception Wednesday to a picture of a made-up creature that satirizes the state 's new science standards hanging on a Stucky Middle School teacher 's door . Fellow board member Sue Gamble told The Eagle that Morris asked for the picture to be removed . The creature , called the Flying Spaghetti Monster , is the creation of Bobby Henderson of Corvallis , Ore . It looks like a clump of spaghetti with two eyes sticking out of the top and two meatballs flanking the eyes . Henderson created the entity and an accompanying mythology on the origin of mankind to make fun of Kansas ' recent debate over the teaching of criticisms of evolution , including intelligent design . In November , the board voted 6-4 to allow criticisms of evolution to be taught in Kansas schools . Morris , who voted for the new science standards , saw the picture during the tour . She did not return phone calls for this report . Gamble , who voted against the new standards and was also on the tour , said that Morris asked principal Kenneth Jantz to have the picture taken down . Board members toured Stucky before finishing two days of meetings in Wichita on Wednesday . Gamble said that when she saw the picture during the tour , she knew that some board members would n't approve of it . `` When we went into that classroom , students were looking at rock formations , '' Gamble said . `` Connie stopped to talk to a teacher and I moved on . That was when I was aware of the flyer . I thought 'she 's probably going to say something to the teacher . ' `` Gamble said that when Morris saw the picture , she asked the principal , who was on the tour , to take it down . Jantz did not comment for this report . Gamble said she did n't see Morris talk to Randy Mousley , the teacher , or to the principal , but that she later went up to Mousley and asked if Morris said anything to him about the picture . That 's when Gamble learned that Morris had asked the principal to take it down . The monster 's picture has hung on the door since September or October and was put up there as a joke , Mousley said . `` It 's a parody , '' he said . `` It 's just making fun of anti-evolution . '' Mousley said he does n't teach students about the Flying Spaghetti Monster . Also on the door is a Doonesbury comic strip about science , said board member Carol Rupe , who represents Wichita . She also voted against the new standards . `` It was two little pieces of paper on the door , '' she said . `` It was poking good fun . '' Gamble said she told the principal that it was his decision whether the monster could stick around . `` I advised the principal that Morris has no authority , '' she said . `` I told him to deal with his staff as he saw fit , not by what a state board member says . '' Board chairman Steve Abrams , who voted for the new standards , did n't see the picture but said he thinks that the Flying Spaghetti Monster is silly . `` Personally , I think it 's juvenile , '' he said . The picture was still on the door at the end of the school day Wednesday . Reach Icess Fernandez at ( 316 ) 268-6544 or ifernandez @ wichitaeagle.com .

I think it is undeniable that the courts have rendered the 14th amendment meaningless . I think they do `` fear '' how things would play out but they have done it so much that they have no idea how to proceed now . Substantive due process is n't well defined , no one knows what the privileges and immunities clause means and what it comes down to is like a fail-safe argument for the courts to claim a 14th amendment violation when they have nothing us . Anywho , to answer your question , yes , Thomas relied on the privileges and immunities clause .
Larval anurans have demonstrated phenotypic plasticity in response to variation in food availability ( Anholt 1998 ) . It has been argued that food availability and predation risk are intertwined . This can be demonstrated when food resources in an environment are high , search time by prey is reduced and predation success may suffer . During times of limited food availability search time may be lengthened , thus increasing prey vulnerability to predation ( Anholt and Werner 1998 ) . In the presence of predators , search time is reduced as activity is restricted to avoid predation .
See , you can get soap so you really have n't lost the right to keep and bear arms ...
Another lie . The sentence you 've quoted never made any such argument .

I was not speaking about legalities . I was speaking on the giving of an oath and what it means . What does one 's word on something mean ?  I believe it holds more of a token gesture to medicine itself . But I suppose that differs on how you plan to interpret it either in a conservative or progressive standpoint . In a conservative viewpoint it couldnt be applied to abortion . Also , I 'm not sure what you mean when you say the `` authors ... also authorized abortion . '' Perhaps you can clarify . Are you speaking to the modern oath ?  No , I am talking about the Hippocrates themselves .
No , this is not about abortion , and I think that is very clear . If I wanted to discuss abortion , then I would mosey on along to the abortion forum and post there .
I think it is great school kids are learning to speak their minds . These are the future leaders and voters in America . It is good they are learning to make a difference . Bettter than silence !

What IS non-material ? We are told what it 's `` not '' , `` not matter '' , but we are not told what it IS . How can a person have knowledge of the `` non-material '' ? Such a term is used in defense of creationism , can it be thrown out , or is it valid evidence ? -Mach
Creation : The belief that the universe ( and of course everything in it ) was created by some supernatural entity . To support creation you must first tackle the concept of something `` outside '' the knowable universe . Because this is irrational , the entire concept of creation is irrational to `` believe '' in . You can believe in it , but you must accept that the belief is not a rational belief .

The simple fact is that people do n't want the immense responsibility that logically pertains to their voluntary actions actions , so they fabricate denials of reality as a convenient escape , out of pure selfishness -- like every other atrocity in history . The study of law includes an analysis of how people excuse their wrongdoings , fabricating pausible rationalizations for their acting to benefit at another 's expense ; denial is typically the first of these , claiming that the act `` does not hurt anyone , '' however obvious the contrary . Other rationales follow , such as self-preservation , natural right to act , and eventually growing defensive by blaming the victim . While the fabricator typically believes his story original , it is anything but -- it 's simply the inevitable course of selfishness .
Statement on Fort Hood Tragedy Nov 6 , 2009 Washington , DC - Paul Helmke , President of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence , issued the following statement about the tragedy at Fort Hood , Texas : Our deepest sympathies go to the families who lost loved ones or are today visiting them in the hospital . Along with the rest of the country , we wish the Fort Hood community a return to a secure and safe environment . When I heard of the tragedy yesterday , we were in the midst of planning a response to the latest dangerous legislative proposal from the gun lobby in the United States Senate - language to automatically restore access to guns to veterans designated by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Justice Department as mentally incapacitated or mentally incompetent. In light of what happened yesterday - a violent attack by an emotionally unstable soldier - it is even clearer that the proposal being pushed by Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina should be rejected . America has seen an epidemic of horrific gun violence at churches and synagogues , workplaces , health clubs , high schools , universities , police stations and now Army bases . This latest tragedy , at a heavily fortified army base , ought to convince more Americans to reject the argument that the solution to gun violence is to arm more people with more guns in more places . Enough is enough. # # # As the nation 's largest , non-partisan , grassroots organization leading the fight to prevent gun violence , the Brady Campaign , with its dedicated network of Million Mom March Chapters , works to enact and enforce sensible gun laws , regulations and public policies . The Brady Campaign is devoted to creating an America free from gun violence , where all Americans are safe at home , at school , at work , and in our communities .

If you can find something untrue in the article , point it out and proffer your evidence ; otherwise ... I did n't think posters were required to `` balance '' their opinions here .
... I mean , we live in a Christian nation and we still kind of think , in our heart of hearts , that if a woman or girl is raped IT 'S HER FAULT .
Sorry , I should n't have jumped to that conclusion Sometimes this forum gets the best of me ... sorry again .
My main issue is with the single common ancestor model and the only other viable explanation for the origin of life on earth , creationsim . I see the publication of Darwin 's Origin of Species to be a watershed event that permenantly established the single common ancestor model as the foundation of evolutionary biology .
You have the obligation to respect their choices just as we respect yours .
Im not sure why we are repeating this over and over . Its a being but not a human being until it has brain waves in my opinion .
By what standard does 'love ' include causing infinite suffering ? Do you intentionally cause suffering to anyone you love ?
Someone brought up a interesting point yesterday ... they stated the court might have created an equal protection problem with their ruling . I 'm not sure if that has any merit but interesting to look at .
Hey I 'm new . I am also pro-life 100 % . No Exceptions .
Under then bill pushed through in the middle of the night : 1.a healthy 25-year-old in Milwaukee will see his costs rise by 178 % . 2.A small business in Richmond with eight employees will see a 23 % increase . 3.Insurance for a 40-year-old family with two kids in Indianapolis will pay 106 % more 4.Collection of payroll taxes for the new plan will begin Jan. 2010 , but benefits do n't start until 2014 . 5 . Payment to doctors for Medicare patients will decrease 21.5 % next year and more after that . How many doctors do you think will continue to treat Medicare patients when that happens ? 6 . The plan will cost $ 871Billion over the next decate , but 98 % of the cost occurs after 2014 . 7 . Medical device manufacturers pay $ 2Billion/year in taxes . This will rise to $ 3Billion/year in 2018 , removing $ 1Billion that could be used for R & amp ; D and adding it to the cost of current devices instead . 8 . The rest of the country will pay ALL of Nebraska 's state contributions to Medicare FOREVER because that was the bribe that the Democrats made for the 60th vote . Now , Cake Lady , prove me wrong !
You mean pro-murder ! Admit it ! Folks on the pro-abortion side are so hung-up on the so-called `` quality of life '' of people that they just do n't care about the ensuing consequences of an increasingly hostile culture of death .
Introduction to special issue Testing Our Defenses Stephen J. Simpson and John Travis Figure 1 CREDIT : C. BICKEL/SCIENCE Challenge the immune system , and you might well induce a vigorous response . Challenge an immunologist , and you can be confident of eliciting something rather similar . Indeed , our rate of progress in understanding the immune system has been anything but sluggish over the past few decades . This has encouraged a mood of optimism that new vaccines for infectious diseases and immune-based therapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases are just around the corner . Yet despite this brisk pace of discovery and some enticing glimpses of how the immune system might be manipulated , there is much that is clearly left to explore about its inner workings . In this special issue , we consider a selection of fundamental immunological questions that still test investigators . As Casanova and Abel explain ( p. 617 ) , the genetic study of human primary immunodeficiencies is an emerging field that is revealing surprises about our evolving relationship with the world of pathogens . Kioussis and Georgopoulos ( p. 620 ) discuss the epigenetic rules that govern lymphocyte function and development , and , Reiner et al . ( p. 622 ) frame some of the most pertinent issues in T cell fate determination . Cell biology and immunology have long been intimate partners , and Mellman ( p. 625 ) uses the study of antigen presentation to explain how discoveries in basic cell biology continue to underpin our understanding of the immune system . Finally , Sakaguchi and Powrie ( p. 627 ) reveal just how much there is still to learn about the regulatory T cell and its power in preventing overzealous immune responses and autoimmunity . In News , Leslie ( p. 614 ) describes how immunologists have struggled to understand the purpose of mast cells , and Cohen ( p. 612 ) updates the daring efforts of gene therapists to reboot the human immune system with cells impervious to HIV . Science 's STKE focuses on some molecular challenges for immunologists ( www.sciencemag.org/sciext/immunology07 ) . Lind & # 233 ; n describes how the adaptor protein Act1 mediates interleukin-17 receptor signaling . Serfling et al . discuss the importance of NFAT transcription factors to memory lymphocytes . Finally , Wattenberg and Raben describe the negative regulation of various immune responses by diacylglycerol kinase . We are still learning about how immune cells move around the body , and in the research section a Report by Auffrey et al . ( p. 666 ) describes a subset of monocytes that patrol the surfaces of blood vessels for damage and inflammation , contrasting their behavior with that of typical leukocytes . Mueller et al . ( p. 670 ) offer up some intriguing evidence that lymphoid organs `` close up shop '' for new business during an immune response , by using chemokine regulation to prevent the admission of circulating na & # 239 ; ve lymphocytes . In research that may shed some evolutionary light on an ancient system , Chen et al . ( p. 678 and see related News item ) describe how the social amoeba Dictyostelium uses specialized cells akin to phagocytes in animals . Finally , Carmody et al . ( p. 675 ) reveal the means by which normally potent signals mediated by the innate immune Toll-like receptors are placated by blocking ubiquity-nation . With so much left to discover about our immune system , there seems little doubt that immunologists will find plenty to challenge them in the years to come .
Global warming may or may not be the result of what humans are doing , although it sure is n't helped by our destorying the environment . Now the increasing amount of natural disasters worries me a lot more than global warming which does n't seem to be progressing to quickly ( from winter to early summer , 136 of 140 days were below average temperature where I live ) . I could really use some global warming up here in Michigan ! ! !

The decision by the 9th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said the amendment 's right to bear arms is intended to maintain effective state militias and is not an individual right . `` The historical record makes it equally plain that the amendment was not adopted in order to afford rights to individuals with respect to private gun ownership or possession , '' Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote . The 9th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals is the same federal court that ruled earlier this year that the phrase `` under God '' in the Pledge of Allegiance violates the separation of church and state . http : //www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,72371,00.html
Good ideas , but it 's damn hard to remain calm and dispassionate when people like supersport come into the equasion with their approach .
I suspect that a lot of people , if not most people , at least partially follow some version of `` treat others as you would have yourself be treated '' . When , as children , we were scolded `` How would you like it if ... '' that is a tactic of teaching this rule . For those who are religious ( which I only marginally , occasionally and hesitatingly am ) , even Jesus stated `` Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you . '' in the Sermon on the Mount talk ( as quoted by ShadowPikachu ) . Many world religions and philosophies seem to incorporate that general rule , which is partly why I think it has a reasonable chance at being incorporated as a global base of morality .
Atheist answer : its relgious PEOPLE that expect us to believe in God . God himself does n't have any kind of expectations . Theist answer : the bible says that without faith its impossible to please God , and since the bible also says that the bible is God 's true word , then we only need faith to believe the bible and by extension to believe in God .
You clam something can be outside the scope of knowledge ( science ) . To claim so is a contradiction , you can not claim to know something of the unknowable . It 's by definition ... yes , as we 've been through this countless times , UNKNOWABLE .
I think this is unlikely under the current makeup of the Supreme Court . But that of course is the fear that many have , i.e. , that gay marriage would be imposed via judicial fiat ( whether at the state or federal level ) rather than through legislative means .
SS : How does evolution happen when mutations do not and can not create new body parts ? Evolutionists need a mechanism of random change that links new body parts to a vehicle of inheritance . But they do n't have it.Actually random mutation combined with selection and inheritance is all thats needed . .
Evolution requires an old Earth , an old solar system , and an old universe .
all point to the fact that all the supposed geologic periods actually occurred at the same time in the recent past .
This is their words as nothing science has `` proven '' overturns anything the Bible says . Most scientist agree is not proof . Many times most scientist are wrong .
Of course it is . It is just one more cog in the wheel of our moral and social decline that will lead to our complete destruction as a rational and civilized Society . And the radical gay agenda has proven they have the same ethics as Al-Queda and practices a scorched Earth Policy too . You will gladly tear down our Democracy in order to gain the undeserved rights you demand for yourselves . You see nothing wrong with forcing the majority of the population to submit to the immoral will of a tiny minority when all of the human and civil rights protections have already been afforded you . But that is not enough for you . You must force your unnatural lifestyles in our faces and then insist we are bigots for not enjoying or just accepting the perversions you see as natural , normal and right . Just because you ca n't see , or refuse to see the long term negative effects of your unnatural lifestyle being imposed on the larger society , it does n't for one minute mean they are n't real and evident in their destructive consequences .
Ah the non human part .
I do not see any problem with the Jehova 's or any other 's idea of a scriptural account . Once the debate has begun , I will not make another post until the end . One week sounds reasonable - you might want to post within a shorter gap later on , but that will be up to the person posting . You should both be able to post in your own time . A week is sufficient , I should think . I recommend that no limit be placed on posts , but that it is recommended that posts stay generally smaller . It 's far more challenging to be succint than to write gallons . One more tip : it 's a good idea to , in your first posts , include definition so that terms might be clarified , and it avoids later , unecessary hassle . If we just wait for Hank 's clarification on those few points , then we can then begin !
I place value on the life of the feotus because it is close to human , it has the potential to become human .
I wonder , how do all the other democracies manage to survive without the protection of a heavily armed citizenry ? Does this mean that the found fathers of America realised that they were not to be trusted ?
so yes the existance of other religions can be seen as disproof for your god , becuas logic dictates that you must ask yourself why your god didint speak to people in asia or south america .
Thanks Archangel , There is definately enough for me to look over here . Yes , I will let you know how the program develops . Spring is only 4 months away !
For your info just a many Democrat go to church as well so whats that suppose to mean too . Come on Satin get with the real world .
Since the universe must have had a finite existence , it must have been created .
Gun angle . Sinjin . This is not an Anti-union rant . This is a DC police , and Township police question . SEIU Service Employees Union International . In other words , all of the people involved are employed by the Government . That means they work for us . The Police are employed by us . The DC Police backed the SEIU , and the article said they were there to protect SEIU . And maybe even worse than that , is the fact that the township police were maybe either afraid of SEIU or were sympathetic to their goals . And Screw that ! ! ! ! ! ! They are employed to protect the people on that street . Otherwise , we have anarchy . But , it is a fact that , Everyone there is employed by us . However , if this not be the case , I asked for an explanation that makes sense . But , if this be true , and if it is n't brought under control , are we then supposed to then fear our very own police because maybe they belong to SEIU , or hope to join ? Or something ? Or whatever ? I do n't know . Then who do we trust ? Whom can we then count on besides ourselves ? If that be the case , what do we need police for ? If the home owner does n't know who is the enemy in this situation , and who is coming to help , this is a tragic circumstance I do n't even want to contemplate ! Too much corruption for my small brain to try and figure out ! I can tell you that much ! Can SEIU take over law enforcement just that easily ? Are we subject to be held up by a Police Union ? I do n't know the answers to these questions . So I asked for help figuring it out . I think you belong to SEIU , are you proud of this situation ? It also turns out that the Bank Executive worked for the Clinton Administration so I am defending someone from your party . This is n't partisanship !
Women have been denigrated and made fun of for centuries . I 've just gotten tired of it -- and righteously so .
Nearly all informed evolutionists will admit that without billions of years their theory is dead .
It may be perfectly legitimate to make these inferences , but the point of the statement from wikipedia was that micro-evolution is directly and ( more importantly ) currently observable . This seems to be a huge difference between macro and micro evolution , especially when one remembers the defintion of the scientific method .
where do concepts come from when all that exist is matter , we know concepts are outside and are not dependent on matter or experence , or being discovered ( if we did not discover them they would still exist ) how can matter bring about something that is not matter
Ha ha , supersport and snakespit . The whole reason I started this thread is because I kneed to know what evos think Carbon Dating is before I can disprove it .
humans did not evolve from Blobs , they did not `` evolve '' from fishes , this is not reality , the first humans looked exactly like us today as the human race looked 2000 years ago .

Easily :
yeah , i know ... like many religions , people just claim they are one and then think they can just pick and choose what to follow . To me , you are all or nothing so those that think the Pope is an XXXXX should probably consider a new faith because they do n't believe in the one they say they do .
There is no evidence either way .
Personally against abortion ... .but pro-choice . I have heard this many times and have yet to understand the basis for this position .
You ONLY post anti-Christian threads , even though Christianity has been responsible for much of the good in the world .

its difficult to merge life in its purest form with science , even though science 's purpose is to study life .
The 10 commandments are a real time story , told and recorded by the person with whom it happened to ... Moses . Genesis , is a history lesson , told by a man who had no understanding of modern science , or the language to describe it in that fashion ... Moses .
On the contrary Peeling . The first thing to consider is if in fact our lineage 's ever in fact diverged at all .
*Yes , evolution is a theory . Then again , what is God ?
Only a complete XXXXX , devoid of even the slightest measurable amount of critical thinking skills , would support Chicago 's handgun ban .
I can not prove that my belief in my specific God is true any more then I can prove that leprechauns , unicorns , the flying spaghetti monster , magical space monkeys and living care bears exists . That does n't mean I do n't believe in God however .
... except for the surprising lack of feathers present .
Global warming sure is a threat . Some of the Polar Ice Caps already melted . Average temperatures have rised since 50+ years ago at a constant rate . We better stop polluting now , or we will be in big trouble .
It says right in the Constitution ... `` We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal , and that they are endowed with certain unalienable rights , life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ... etc . etc . '' Would n't one gay man marrying another be considered a 'pursuit of happiness ' ? Just my thoughts .
When 'evidence ' is interpreted , it is interpreted by flawed and failed humans with biases just like everyone else 's .
Let me illustrate : A creation teacher is teaching about creation when an atheist student raises his hand . `` Yes ? '' says the teacher . The student explains , `` Teacher , I 'm an atheist . There is no god . '' `` Then what is 'right and wrong ' ? You have to have standards to these thoughts or being an atheist is irrational . '' declares the teacher . The student replies , `` That 's easy . I 'm the god of my own universe. `` `` Well that 's just wonderful because I am going to shoot you in 5 minutes . '' claims the teacher . The student exclaims , `` You ca n't do that ! '' `` Oh yes I can . See , I 'm the god of my own universe. ``
Jyoshu pretty much answered for me so I wo n't go back but I will say that your morality is formed based on arbitrary things as well . Whether you believe in a god or make yourself god you still are making arbitrary rules for which you develop a morality . The idea that you do n't want to suffer and therefore came up with this morality is abritrary as everything we have stated . Why was n't the conclusion `` I dont ' want to suffer so be stronger than everyone else '' or `` I do n't want to suffer so do n't associate with anyone else '' . Or maybe the conslusion could be to believe in a religion . Either way , you are going to have to believe in something and that forms the basis for a morality .
To support creation you must first tackle the concept of something `` outside '' the knowable universe .
ahhh , thats where youre mistaken . ANY aspect of science that can be discredited helps strengthen the creationist stance .
Each atom is alive , it 's an energy form , your consciousness transforms your atomic structure to meet the requirements of the enviroment in which you exsist . This explains why people have different colour skin , and why elephants have big ears , and why fish have fins , etc .

not sure about that . Viralistic ? That does n't seem to make alot of sense . Most of humanity is n't actively invading and replicating itself for seemingly no real reason .
As I have pointed out , the only BS here is your accusations .
The quality of life ethic is far different from sactity/dignity of life ethic . A quality of life ethic carried out to its logical conclusions does not promote a pro-life society . Instead , there would be genocide against the handicapped , elderly , and people who people of power have deemed life unworthy of life . The problem with this ethic is that it is centered in arbritrary people deciding arbritarily which person passes the `` quality of life '' test .
How would you like to have a parasite in your body and not be given treatment to remove it based solely on the fact that even parasitic organisms are living things and deserve life ?
And of course , after God had killed `` every thing that is in the earth , '' a dove managed to find a live olive leaf as a sign of receding floodwaters .
Did you know prior to humans it was at .018 % ?
In the latter case , that 's because more fornicators are shacking up rather than getting married , which is why there 's fewer divorces . If a state allows gay marriages their spirituality is in the toilet . Gay sex sin is a perversion and an abomination according to the Bible .
Alex found exactly the same sequence of primes linked to the same series of biblical messages .
Pregnancy is a very expensive thing ( which is why I find it ridiculous that pro-lifers offer adoption as if it was such a great option , because adoption itself can be free , but they do n't take into consideration everything before adoption ) , and we could n't afford to have a child to give up for adoption let alone actually raise one .
The day when you have to walk into that abortion clinic and make that decision , you stand up and tell me what a real man is . Those poor girls and women who go through abortions did what they had to do , more than you could ever do . Do n't stand on your high horse and lecture the world on the virtuousness of your position . Do n't talk about being virtuous , be virtuous . A `` real man '' helps those who he loves , whether he likes what they did . A father loves his sons and daughters , despite what they do , rather in spite of what they have done . Good day to you .
MEDICAL FACT : On the fourteenth day of the first month the mothers egg appears .
You mean what you got was an eye opening shocker into the world of leftist propaganda , and I can see that like a good sheeple you swallowed it hook line and sinker . Thankfully though , most people chose not to submit themselves to his brand of commentary and stayed away from the drivel you will so easily endorse because the movie tanked . Did n't you notice how empty it was in there for an opening weekend ?
Hey everyone im new to the whole creation vs evolution thing . I do n't really know where i stand but i have a question .
Yeah ! The NRA is just encouraging a Wild West shootouts in our streets ! Yeah , that stupid NRA ! So I thought I would take a look at the records . This is ALL justifiable homicides and not just concealed carry permit holders , from 1996 to the last date of records on the FBI website 2007 . So according to the Anti-gun side , we should see a humongous progression of citizen killings of innocent citizens , or in other words , criminals , as the number of Concealed Carry states pass their laws and allow permit holders carry concealed handguns . No ? From Expanded Homicide Data Table 14 - Crime in the United States 2005 and http : //www.fbi.gov/filelink.html ? fil ... /00tbl2-17.xls and Justifiable Homicide by Weapon , Private Citizen,1 2003-2007 Oooops ! So lets look at Law enforcement just for comparison of the normal fluctuation in the number of incidents ! From http : //www.fbi.gov/filelink.html ? fil ... /00tbl2-16.xls and Expanded Homicide Data Table 13 - Crime in the United States 2005 and Justifiable Homicide by Weapon , Law Enforcement,1 2003-2007 Oooops again ! Like always , just bloated hype from the Anti-Constitutionalists ! Nothing more !
If god could create the world in 7 days then he sure as hell could get someone pregnant .
I have actually been called a heathen because I believe in evolution . I have been called ignorant . This damned well gives me the right to call someone mindless if I want to . The mudslinging occurs on both sides , and do n't think I 've never been on the receiving end of it .
One town of guys with shotguns wo n't cow the US Military , and a .45 is n't much good against an F-15 . So unless one is prepared to argue that civilians should have the right to own similar weaponry , heavy artillery , even nuclear weapons , this argument must fall.This argument would lead to the conclusion that to adequately combat the government , private citizens would need to have machine guns , bazookas , shoulder launched missiles , tanks , blackhawk helicopters , and yes even nuclear weapons . Again , this exemplifies the idiocy of the NRA 's arguments .
Do you want them all dead ?
And the thing is , Darwinists have long known about horizontal gene transfer  decades even . But see science is not interested in promoting it because it 's not friendly towards their mechanistic , materialist theory .
Of course the first step towards eliminating gun violoence is to outlaw guns . Look at what a gun free utopia New York and Los Angeles have become .
Another problem I have that feeds this preconceived notion assertion is the mislabeling of these allegedly ancient fossils by referring to them as Java MAN , Peking MAN , Neanderthal MAN when they were n't absolutely , necessarily men at all , but simply primates that are assumed once again , to be related to us .
Are those weapons registered ?
Then do n't post because there is no reason any of us should listen to you . You are just a classic example of the pot calling the kettle black .
lol , zenodotus . You refute your own point and strengthen mine . You stated that we can not know whether the fetus is or is not morally a person , yet now you state that the fetus is morally a person to you ? That was my point , that we can know because some think it is morally a person and some think it is not morally a person . Me stating that is was not morally a person to me was merely an example .
It gets worse . I went to a presentation of Creation Science once and this 80 year old `` archaeologist '' told me that before the flood , the atmospheric pressure of the planet was double what it is now and that the oxygen content was higher .

Not with you Mr. Muddy Waters . It 's a bunch of bull**** , another attempt at a causation/correlation bait and switch tactic without any evidence to back it up . There are plenty of people who have constant access to firearms , and yet never display violent tendencies .
Following the logic of several people here , whatever God says is morally correct , therefore abortions are morally correct because God said so . Let 's see who 's going to be consistent about their beliefs .
Adding guns to crime is like adding gasoline to a fire- it makes an already existing problem worse .
`` ( 25 . ) I believe in gun control ( and wrote this piece to satirize pro-gunners ) because I hate guns and want to see them all banned , which is why I own guns and also enjoy reading firearms-related literature . ''
The phrase `` # # # # hits the fan '' refers to what would happen if such an event occurred , a big mess . For example `` Big Jimmy just found out Sly Jones was sleeping with his wife , the # # # # is really going to hit the fan now ! '' Substituting something else into the metaphor other than # # # # renders it meaningless , its unclear what would happen if a `` theory '' hit a fan , are you trying to say it would make a mess , that nothing would happen , that it would spin in circles ?
The only people practicing equivocation are those seeking to lump abiogenesis in with evolution , or cosmology in with biological evolution : they 're genuinely attempting to distort the meaning of the word in order to bring irrelevant and emotive argumentation into play .
He has nothing else . Bleating about the stars being placed in such a way as to look older than they really are means that his God either intended us to believe something not true , or intended us to live in ignorance of reality . His confusion over light/years vs time/distance suggest Archie cleaves to the latter .
Religion does not answer neither 'how ' nor 'why ' but seems to satisfy the majority of people by just saying : `` God made it so '' and who would argue with that ?
He was a gun owner and a terrorist .
The family of Greg Baer , Bank of America executive , is located in a jurisdiction protected by the Montgomery County Police Department ( MCPD ) , which responded promptly to a disturbance call from his neighborhood last weekend . According to Corporal Dan Friz , an MCPD spokesperson in Rockville , Maryland , the department received a disturbance call from one of Baers neighbors at 4:10 pm last Sunday . Four MCPD units arrived at Baers Greenville Rd . address at 4:15 pm . At least two Metropolitan Police Department units from the nearby District of Columbia were already at the scene when they arrived .
( Now remember , people actually thought this way in the name of evolution and science ! )
Portugal 's Parliament Approves Gay Marriage
Halton Arp is far from suppressed.Any complaints about telescope time echo the complaints of astronomers everwhere that have to clamor and compete for the same telescopes .
For anti-choicers , it 's just about control and power over women . They do n't care about life . ( Except their own . )
In a way , taking rights away is an American value since we have prescribed methods for doing it . For instance , we have legislatures which posess authority to remove a large number of what you likely consider to be rights . Here are just a small number that come to mind : 1 ) Right to murder 2 ) Right to own slaves 3 ) Right to rape 4 ) Right to abusing children 5 ) Right to vote 6 ) Right to smoke ( if you 're under 18 ) 7 ) Right to drink ( 18th Amendment ) 8 ) Right to engage in certain activities in public 9 ) Right to drive as fast as one wants 10 ) Right to dump dangerous chemicals in the nearest river The list goes on really . The fact is that you do n't object to taking rights away in principle , you only object to taking away those rights that you wish to retain . That is quite inconsistent . Where do you get the idea that one has a right to perform an abortion anyway ?
Another slimy attempt by you to misrepresent my position . Of course eight children being murdered is a horrible tragedy but statistically it does n't tell us anything . You and your comrades might want to educate yourselves about the meaning of `` statistical significance '' before responding .
And , of course , you totally miss the point . The point is that a 1-day-old infant can be cared for by ANYBODY ! It is no longer dependent upon the body and resources of only one person . But , of course , if that one person is only a lowly , less than human woman , that lowly person has absolutely no rights to compare with that of the almighty , holy fetus .

In 1927 , Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. declared it `` better for all the world '' if the `` manifestly unfit '' could be stopped from reproducing . `` Three generations of imbeciles are enough , '' he famously wrote in his ruling in Buck v. Bell , which affirmed the constitutionality of forced sterilization of people deemed genetically inferior . . . . in the mid-1800 's . . . the British polymath Sir Francis Galton . . . introduced the idea of intelligence as an inherited trait and . . . developed a science to promote it , which he named eugenics . In America , Galton 's ideas were picked up by the biologist Charles Davenport , who in 1904 established Cold Spring Harbor laboratory on Long Island as a national center for eugenics research and policy planning . . . . Davenport created a Eugenics Records Office and recruited an ambitious young high school teacher named Harry Laughlin to join him in an enormous project that sent fieldworkers across the country to identify the `` germ-plasm '' of unfit family strains so that it could be eradicated . Laughlin became an influential developer of American compulsory sterilization policy , which had officially begun in 1907 when Indiana passed a law allowing scientists to use surgical methods to eradicate the unfit . . . .He helped Congress formulate the 1924 Immigration Act , which kept out `` inferior '' people from Southern and Eastern Europe . Bruinius deftly plays up the contrast between the eugenicists ' obsession with cold measurements of human value and their own messy lives , which were marked by disease and behavior that could have qualified them as unfit : Galton suffered from severe depression ; Davenport had one child who was sickly and another who was apparently dyslexic ; and Laughlin was afflicted with epilepsy . In America and elsewhere , enthusiasm for eugenics was broadly supported by elites . In Britain , people as varied as Winston Churchill and George Bernard Shaw embraced its goals , and there was lively debate about how much the state itself should control reproduction of individuals . Eugenic science especially appealed to Fabian socialists , who saw it as further justification for abolishing class  after all , once the playing field was level the effect of heredity could finally express itself clearly and be studied . In this country , eugenic theory and practice engaged the likes of Theodore Roosevelt , the birth control crusader Margaret Sanger and leaders of the Carnegie and Rockefeller foundations . It galvanized temperance advocates , suffragists , and liberal American churches and synagogues . Citizens enthusiastically entered `` Fitter Family '' and `` Better Baby '' contests .
Sorry to hear you say this . I have never attacked you personally , never said anything like what you accuse me of saying .
so if cells are controlled by their genes ( and the environment ) , what would you predict would happen to the cell if its genes were removed ?
Not only that but the whole theory of evolution is a result of changes in genes ( or alleles ) .

They are different terms and apply to different things . Secularism is not a worldview in itself , it is a policy of how to apply religious and other worldview in real life . Secularism does not exclude people with a religious worldview . One may imagine a devout christian that firmly believes in his faith , but is also convinced that faith must come from within and that forcing someone to behave in accordance with a religion simply encourages false faith , and would logically conclude that his faith should not be forced upon people ( usually with the subclause of `` Let them burn in hell afterwards '' , or something else along those lines ) .
I was actually looking up on the story of the Uzi , AK47 and the M16 . After doing some research I settled on the upgraded M16 as my weapon of choice . It has great automatic , whoop-butt accuracy and amazing reload times . It is my favrioute weapon for combat ( should I ever have to fight in a war or such ) , but for home-defense I have to go with the AK47 . Cause lets be honest , we ca n't clean weapons all day and the AK47 gives you the ease of mind of knowing your weapon is n't going to conk out when the murderer charges at ya . Although the other assualt rifles may have more stopping power , accuracy etc. , I have to go with the Uzi for portable self-defense , mainly because of its small design . So , not going into the argument on whether guns are moral or whatever , what is your weapon of choice and why ?

First of all , i can turn around right here , because i can see that you already have no idea what you are talking about . Pro-choicers do not advocate the abortion of fetuses . Anti-choice antics are getting pretty dirty these days .

Dr. Martin Luther King 's niece , Dr. Alveda C. King , who underwent two abortions presents , `` How Can the Dream Survive ? `` : In the ongoing travesty of the debate over whether abortion and infanticide should be condoned , a voice in the wilderness continues to cry out , `` what about the children ? '' We have been fueled by the fire of `` womens rights , '' so long that we have become deaf to the outcry of the real victims whose rights are being trampled upon , the babies and the mothers . Of course a woman has a right to decide what to do with her own body . Thank God for the Constitution . Yet , she also has a right to know the serious consequences and repercussions of making a decision to abort her child . Then too , what about the rights of each baby who is artificially breached before coming to term in his or her mothers womb , only to have her skull punctured , and feel , yes agonizingly `` feel '' the life run out of her before she takes her first breath of freedom . What about of the rights of these women who have been called to pioneer the new frontiers of the new millennium only to have their lives snuffed out before the calendar even turns ? Oh , God , what would Martin Luther King , Jr. , who dreamed of having his children judged by the content of their characters do if hed lived to see the contents of thousands of childrens skulls emptied into the bottomless caverns of the abortionists pits ? It is time for America , perhaps the most blessed nation on earth to lead the world in repentance , and in restoration of life ! If only we can carry the freedom of repentance to its fullest potential . If only America can repent and turn away from the sins of our nation . Abortion is at the forefront of our destruction . Partial Birth Abortion is perhaps the most heinous form of this legal genocide . Direct links connecting abortion and serious conditions such as breast and cervical cancer , emotional disorders and other serious ills must be considered ! The only healing and redemption is in the blood of Jesus , blood willingly shed so that we could stand today and cry out for the blood of the unborn that is drenching the land of our children . What terribly mixed signals we are sending to our society today ? We allow and even encourage them to engage in promiscuous sex . Then when their sin conceives , we pretty much tell them , `` dont kill your babies , let our abortion facilities do it for you . '' We march to cure breast cancer , yet promote one of the biggest contributors . I am a mother of six living children , and I am a grandmother . I am also a post-abortive mother . In the early 1970s , I suffered one involuntary and one voluntary abortion . My involuntary abortion was performed just prior to Roe v. Wade by my private physician without my consent . I had gone to the doctor to ask why my cycle had not resumed after the birth of my son . I did not ask for and did not want an abortion . The doctor said , You dont need to be pregnant , lets see. He proceeded to perform a painful examination which resulted in a gush of blood and tissue emanating from my womb . He explained that he had performed a local D and C. Soon after the Roe v. Wade decision , I became pregnant again . There was adverse pressure and threat of violence from the babys father . The ease and convenience provided through Roe v. Wade made it too easy for me to make the fateful and fatal decision to abort our child . I went to a doctor and was advised that the procedure would hurt no more than having a tooth removed. The next day , I was admitted to the hospital , and our baby was aborted . My medical insurance paid for the procedure . As soon as I woke up , I knew that something was very wrong . I felt very ill , and very empty . I tried to talk to the doctor and nurses about it . They assured me that it will all go away in a few days . You will be fine. They lied . Over the next few years , I experienced medical problems . I had trouble bonding with my son , and his five siblings who were born after the abortions . I began to suffer from eating disorders , depression , nightmares , sexual dysfunctions and a host of other issues related to the abortion that I chose to have . I felt angry about both abortions , and very guilty about the abortion I chose to have . The guilt made me very ill. My children have all suffered from knowing that they have a brother or sister that their mother chose to abort . Often they ask if I ever thought about aborting them and have said , You killed our baby. This is very painful for all of us . Also , my mother and grandparents were very sad to know about the loss of the baby . The aborted childs father also regrets the abortion . If it had not been for Roe v. Wade , I would never have had that abortion , only Jesus can . My birthday is January 22 , and each year , this day is marred by the fact that it is the anniversary of Roe v. Wade , and the anniversary of death for millions of babies . I and my deceased children are victims of abortion , and subsequently the Roe v. Wade decision has adversely affected the lives of my entire family . I pray often for deliverance from the pain caused by my decision to abort my baby . I suffered the threat of cervical and breast cancer , and experienced the pain of empty arms after the baby was gone . And truly , for me , and countless abortive mothers , nothing on earth can fully restore what has been lost , only Jesus can . My grandfather , Dr. Martin Luther King , Sr. , once said , No one is going to kill a child of mine. Tragically , two of his grandchildren had already been aborted when he saved the life of his next great-grandson with this statement . His son , King once said , The Negro can not win as long as he is willing to sacrifice the lives of his children for comfort and safety. How can the Dream survive if we murder the children ? Every aborted baby is like a slave in the womb of his or her mother . The mother decides his or her fate . I join the voices of thousands across America , who are SILENT NO MORE . We can no longer sit idly by and allow this horrible spirit of murder to cut down , yes cut out and cut away our unborn , and destroy the lives of our mothers . I am very grateful to God for the Spirit of Repentance that is sweeping our land . In Repentance there is healing . In the name of Jesus , we must humble ourselves and pray , and turn from our wicked ways , then God will hear from Heaven and Heal Our Land . I can only beseech the powers that be to hearken to the voice of the Lord and remember that human life is sacred . By taking the lives of our young , and wounding the wombs and lives of their mothers , we are flying in the face of God . We can not play God . If we continue down this path of destruction , we will be met at the gates by our own doom . This is the day to choose life . We must live and allow our babies to live . We must end the pain of post-abortion trauma . If the Dream of Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. is to live , our babies must live . Our mothers must choose life . If we refuse to answer the cry of mercy from the unborn , and ignore the suffering of the mothers , then we are signing our own death warrants . I too , like Martin Luther King , Jr. , have a dream . I have a dream that the men and women , the boys and girls of America will come to our senses , and humble ourselves before God Almighty and pray for mercy , and receive His healing grace . I pray that this is the day , the hour of our deliverance . May God have mercy on us all .

King founded King for America , Inc. `` to assist people in enriching their lives spiritually , personally , mentally and economically . '' She is the daughter of the late slain civil rights activist Rev . A. D. King and his wife Naomi Barber King . Alveda is the grateful mother of eight children and she is a doting grandmother . During the more than half century of her life , Alveda has worked towards her purpose of glorifying God in the earth by accomplishing many goals . Currently , Alveda is a minister of the Gospel of Jesus Christ , serving as Director of African American Outreach for Gospel of Life , headed up by Father Frank Pavone of Priests for Life . She also consults with the Africa Humanitarian Christian Fellowship , founded by her mentor , Pastor Allen McNair of Believers ' Bible Christian Church in Atlanta , Georgia . She is a former college professor , holding the Masters of Arts degree in Business Management from Central Michigan University . Her undergraduate studies in journalism and sociology helped her to become a published author , the most popular works being her best selling books SONS OF THUNDER : THE KING FAMILY LEGACY , and I DO N'T WANT YOUR MAN , I WANT MY OWN . This inspirational collection of Christian testimonies is used at conferences and workshops around the world . Alveda 's Doctorate of Laws was conferred by Saint Anslem College . She has served as a Senior Fellow of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institute . She has also served on the boards and committees of numerous organizations , including the SILENT NO MORE AWARENESS CAMPAIGN , COALITION OF AFRICAN AMERICAN PASTORS , and the JUDEO-CHRISTIAN COALITION FOR CONSTITUTIONAL RESTORATION .

During the years of the Civil Rights Movement , led by her Uncle , Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. , Alveda 's family home was bombed in Birmingham , Alabama . In the heat of the struggle . `` Daddy 's house was bombed , then in Louisville , Kentucky his church office was bombed . I was also jailed during the open housing movement , '' she recalls . Alveda has continued her long-term work as a civil rights activist , speaking out on issues that face society today . `` I believe that School Choice is a pressing civil rights issue . Perhaps the most compelling issue of all is the life of the unborn , '' Alveda says . `` Faith in God , and the commitment to fulfill His will for our lives -- not faith in government bureaucracy - is the key to positive action . Have faith in God ! '' This is the message that Alveda carries to the world .
But I do n't hear you saying things like `` baseball is always harmful to the player '' or `` baseball is something no one should have to go through . '' You see , if pro-choicers only used the 'pregnancy-is-bad-if-forced argument , they might have a point , but they often do n't add the last part . Besides , no one ever forces a woman to get pregnant in the first place .
because the earth is older than 10,000 years as many creationists think and the 7 day creation does n't make sense .
To be fair , there are extreme views on the pro-choice side that would alllow almost anything to be considered a health issue - ex . if the mother is stressed out about the pregnancy , or she has high blood pressure during the pregnancy , etc. , and this is the extreme arguement that McCain is addressing . Nevertheless , he is vastly exagerating the pro-choice view based on extreme examples . The trouble is that we as a society , including the pro-choice community , have NOT outlined any criteria for which health issues would be valid reasons and which would not . I think that most of us would view extreme health issues ( such as high chance of paralysis or major heart problems ) to be valid reasons while minor health issues ( short-term stress , or change in post-pregnancy metabolism to have greater weight gain tendency , etc . ) to not be valid reasons for third trimester abortions . I tried to start a thread here once - '' The mother 's health exception - where do we draw the line ? '' - but it did n't get very far in resolving the issue here . Perhaps this could be a good topic to address here .
A free society works by saying `` you ca n't do this stuff but everything else is up to you guys '' . If you go around saying `` you must do it this way '' then you really are n't a free society but you have the government controlling instead .

They always have a choice , whether legally or illegally . But I too hope they choose life . What disturbs me , though , are all the blacks , whites , and Hispanics who claim to be Christians , plus those who claim to be followers of the Jewish Tanakh , and who apparently think voting for a man ( Obama ) who is an abortion enabler , is ok with God . Have they never read Jeremiah 1:5 and Psalm 139:13 , where God is instrumental in some way in creating life in a mother 's womb - perhaps creating the spirit or whatever ?
So what developed nations have lower murder rates than the US ?
You completely miss the point here . A long time ago with the Native American creation stories some of them believed that the Earth was flat . It was just a belief , and teaching everyone that is similar to us teaching intelligent design , except at least they taught it as a parent and not as a public school .
I went about this wrong . I am meaning that it would take millions of years for wings to evolve . During these millions of years , they will be undeveloped , simply masses attached to the dinosaur , and totally useless . When they reach their fully evolved form , they may have been of use , but until then , they could serve no purpose , and help the dino in no way at all , serving only as excess weight , and larger profile , hindering survival by not allowing particularly good hiding or movement . During the actual period of the wings evolution , they would be totally useless .
I bet you would not be opposed if they took a trip to a local church and took bible lessons . Yet you oppose them being informed about sex , pregnacy , and desease controll but would n't mind them being tuaght about the bloody torture and execution of an innocent man .

The founding fathers were afraid to trust the common people with the right to vote . They did n't want mob rule and chaos . `` Most of the Founders believed that property ownership was essential to good citizenship and therefore that only property owners should be able to vote . 'Property ' , in those days , also included slaves , of course , and half of the Founders were slave owners ... .The maintenance of power in the hands of the elite was further strengthened by who could vote . In 1787 , there were about four million people living in the 13 original states . But only about four percent of them , it is estimated , could vote . Excluded were the one million slaves , the two million women , anyone under the age of 21 , and all non-property owners . '' http : //www.alternativesmagazine.com/22/lonsdale.html

This is the old viability arguement , but it just does n't hold up . It means that as our medical technology has gotten progressively better , and a premature baby can survive outside the womb at earlier and earlier stages because of this , the point at which it is unethical and/or considered murder has gotten earlier .
Sigma ... *sigh* ... Lets start off getting one thing straight . Are you suggesting that legal makes moral ?

That wasnt sarcasm .
Firstly : the statement you are trying to support is `` Biologically speaking , a human individual 's life begins at conception '' . However , the word 'life ' - that which you are arguing has a factually determinable beginning , does not have an absolute biological definition . To quote the wikipedia article on it : `` It is still a challenge for scientists and philosophers to define life in unequivocal terms '' . This is doubly the case when considering the 'life ' of an individual , as opposed to the 'life ' of , say , a skin cell . For example , a person with no brain activity can be composed of living cells if they are kept on life support , but legally and medically the individual is considered dead . The argument , then : If 'life ' has no definitive definition , how can you argue that it has a clearly definable start ? Secondly : Consider a zygote . According to you , it is an individual . But a zygote can split into two - to form monozygotic , or 'identical ' , twins . Before splitting , it is one 'individual ' . Afterwards , it is two . Where has the extra individual come from ? Given that the split can happen up to 15 days after fertilisation , when was the start of that individuals life ? Thirdly : In contrast to identical twins , consider a chimera organism . A chimera is made up of cells containing one of two different strands of human DNA - they are formed when two fertilised eggs or early embryos collide and become one embryo , which then goes on to be a single human being . Given that the single individual was created by the merging of two different individuals ( by your definition ) , when was the biological start of their life ?
The discovery of a fossilised rabbit in the Burgess Shale may demolish one of the pillars of modern science , the theory of evolution . The late J . B. S. Haldane famously said that all it would take to falsify evolution is a single Cambrian rabbit fossil , and that is exactly what has been uncovered by paleontologist Dr Wilfred Splenebyrst of the London School of Ergonomics .
Abortion is wrong by every standard . John Roberts and Sam Alito will overturn Roe v. Wade .
the fact that you think life can be created out of non-life in 10 years show how little you know about biology

Not true . If the government changes the definition of handicapped to include a previously non-covered group , and the net effect is to increase costs > $ 50Million , it is an unfunded mandate . Back during GW1 's presidency , they changed the definition of disabled and incurred increased costs through the ADA to pay drunks and drug addicts benefits . http : //www.usccr.gov/pubs/ada/ch4.htm The redefining of `` disabled '' did , indeed , cost a sizeable amount of money .

The Big bang theory predicts that no object in the universe can be older than the Big Bang . Yet the large-scale voids observed in the distortion of galaxies can not have been formed in the time since the Big Bang , without resulting in velocities of present-day galaxies far in excess of those observed . Given the observed velocities , these voids must have taken at least 70 billion years to form , five times as long as the theorized time since the Big Bang .

[ size=7 ] [ size=7 ] When I was 16 I was curious about sex because a couple of my friends had done it and I ( for some dumb reason ) wanted to see what it was like for myself ( peer pressure , I guess ) . After a few weeks my mom started to get bad feelings and confronted me , had me take a pregnancy test , and as I said was ready to kill me . She was ashamed and really did n't give me much of an option as to whether or not I wanted to keep the baby . I 'm 27 now and still think back and ask myself if I have any regrets . I would have a child that would be around 11 years old . I wonder what kind if life the 2 of us would be living . I 'm married now and have 2 children that I love and adore . They have a good life . I 'm glad that I had that choice 11 years ago . A second chance to make it right .

yes , I know it 's a joke thread . Creationists are so incredinly intellectually incompetnetn that they do not even understand the very basics of evolution while attacking in . Hopefully that will goad a few into proving that Creationists on a whole are fundementally stupid .

I 've heard pro-gunners accuse Bellesiles of being a fraud over and over again . I went searching on the web for a more objective source of information about Bellesiles .

Like it or not Fetus is the latin word for Baby . If we can prove a person was at a crime scene through DNA evidence . Then we can prove a person is in his or her Mother 's womb at the time of conception . That statement is pure scientific fact .
2. preventing a poor/unhappy life , 2 . You have no idea whether the unborn will be 'unhappy ' , or even poor , for their lifetime . It would be more sensible to evaluate a person 's life at , age 10 perhaps , and then kill them if they have been unhappy and are likey to continue . Again , anyone on welfare is a likely target . In fact , it might be expedient to simply nuke the poorest parts of the world .
And I just looked up Gentry because I 've never heard of him . I 'd say that if he is `` suppressed '' then its merely due to the fact that he has n't survived the peer review process . This is true for any number of people who have devised alternate theories to the BB . None of these guys has a beef with godless creation , they just think they have the right answer . There are people into the plasma universe , and the electric universe , or whatever , then there are people like Eugene Savov and his `` fireworks '' universe . These people are generally considered crackpots , but they are n't pushing creationism , they are just pushing theories weaker than the BB theory . But really , the BB theory has problems all over the place , most physicists will admit this .
I find it interesting that the slippery slope fallacy keeps popping up again and again in the arguments of pro-gun activists even after the Heller decision . In that decision , the Supreme Court recognized an individual right to own guns but rejected the slippery slope argument that has been used by the gun lobby for years . I also find it hard to believe some of what gets posted in favor of the slippery slope argument- such as claims that Sarah Brady wants all guns to be banned which are contradicted by quotes by her in credible online sources and also such statistics as `` [ i ] t is estimated that there are between 22,000 and 30,000 gun laws on the books in America '' which have little basis in fact : `` The belief that there are approximately 20,000 gun-control laws in the United States has become received wisdom ... .. But as it turns out , there appears to be little basis for the number ... . Since the early 1980s , the National Rifle Association has mounted a very successful campaign to encourage state governments to enact 'preemption ' laws , forbidding local governments from enacting their own gun laws . Today , more than 40 states preempt all or most local gun-control laws , which has likely reduced the overall number of local gun laws ... .Clearly the 20,000 figure is more a product of advocacy than science . And however it was initially derived , the trend toward preemption of local laws has substantially reduced the total . The most informative answer to the question of 'how many gun-control laws ? ' is then 'about 300 major state and federal laws , and an unknown but shrinking number of local laws . ' `` http : //www.brookings.edu/es/urban/pu ... s/gunbook4.pdf So why does the slippery slope fallacy keep appearing despite a Supreme Court ruling that stands in the way of it becoming a reality , a decline in the number of gun laws , and little or no credible evidence to suggest that gun control advocates really do intend to ban all guns ? Could it be that pro-gun extremists find it necessary to resort to the slippery slope fallacy because they find it otherwise difficult to make a convincing argument against reasonable and common sense gun laws aimed at protecting law abiding citizens from gun violence and the misuse of firearms ?
Oh really ? Where ?
By golly ! A day does n't go by in the great and wonderful United States of America that another shooting does n't occur , with a number of deaths and serious wounds . Is n't America wonderful ? That we get to carry around a whole bunch of guns and go out every day and kill and maim ? Wonderful work ! NRA ! Every time I see another story about another shooting in America , sometimes ever two or three shootouts and killings , it absolutely thrills me because I know that the NRA has armed even more Americans and more Americans can now go out and shoot and kill and maim . So , carry on , NRA ! I know you 're working on that wonderful time when every time a new baby is born in this country , right after a baby takes its first breath , a gun will be placed in his or her tiny hand .
I support gay adoption only as a last resort . I am not a biggot but you have to realize that unless you are super rich being the child of a gay couple can have severe consequences . Lets face it . Kids are cruel and if a child has gay parents then they are a target . The best situation for any child is two parents one male and one female . However if that is absolutley not possible then I have no problem with gay adoption .
electrolyte has a point . If the butterfly had changed into another creature then it would have been somethin worth noting . The butterfly stayed as a butterfly .

Here it implies that almost all if not all creeping things on the earth have the breath of life . The breath of life is supposedly where Adam got his soul . So , if animals have it , then they must have souls . Oh , and btw , in the literal translation , here is Genesis 2:7 No mention of a soul here . Only that Adam was a living creature .

And we know this how ? You complain about the 90 % figure being erroneous and then make an unsupported statement like this ? Furthermore , if Mexico is making an earnest attempt to smash the cartels and we 're financing it in part , would n't we want to help reduce the weapons traffic flowing south into the cartel 's arsenals ?
Evolutionarily speaking , it has been shown that Homo erectus fossils overlaps the entire Homo habilis ( monkey ) population . The oldest Homo erectus fossil is dated at just under 2 million years old .the oldest Homo habilis fossil ( primate ) is dated at just over 2 million years old . The fossil record also shows that homo erectus and homo habilis lived side-by-side for a half a million years ( evolutinists time clock ) . Therefore common sense says that homo erectus ( human ) could never have evolved from homo habilis ( monkey ) . Not only that , but the fossil record shows that homo erectus lived alongside homo sapiens for 2 million years . Thus , there is no possible way that there was any evolution via random mutations and natural selection could have occurred .
The Congress , whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary , shall propose Amendments to this Constitution , or , on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States , shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments , which , in either Case , shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes , as part of this Constitution .
And actually the federal laws regarding gun possession and ownership , do n't mean to me .
Even with the Supreme Court ruling , Sinjin and Chet have said otherwise ... on the day this was posted !

So if a gay couple plans to adopt , they can get married ? And if a straight couple gets married , and then find out they ca n't have kids , does their marriage gets changed to a civil union ? Or is it just desire to have kids ?
Fully knowing that chance in itself is not agency - there is no causality in chance , chance is a byproduct of an event therefore can not effect anything , so the equation would look something like : chance + any amount of time = nothing , therefore evolution or any of its pseudo-intellectual ilk are simply impossible .
Nice link . It destroys NATO 's higher death rate `` argument '' , and proves my point . California = `` toughest gun laws '' = 9.8 gun deaths per 100,000 population . Florida = lax gun laws = 11.1 gun deaths per 100,000 population .
In June 2007 , Nature magazine openly denied ( specifically in the name of evolution ) that humans are created in the image of God , which simply points to what evolutionist James Rachels told everybody 17 years earlier , that Darwinian evolution makes the image-of-God claim AND its derivative claim of inherent human dignity , unsustainable and therefore Out-The-Window .
If you consider that a good area to compare American gun crime to , it does n't say much about the safety of America .
We are human at conception . The sperm and ovary cells are human before they even connect . A fingernail clipping is human . What you mean is ; when do we become a person .
Do sufficient science and history in its total amount to enough evidence to conclusively disprove the existence of God ?
It is n't about truth . It is about explaining the evidence as best we can . You did get the second part correct about creationism . That is why some Christians are not creationists .
So where did we come from ? How did all of the matter in the universe propel outward ? Is this one of millions of universes that never cease to start , expand , contract , end and then start again ? You can not answer every question with science . A role for philosophy exists in this world .
Religious people are certainly free to believe their god might participate in such a process . But the concept is equally coherent without any particular religious belief .
I think Ludacris brings up some very important issues that others would rather pretend are n't there in favor of an easier point of view . It 's much easier to sit and say , `` do n't have an abortion '' than to stand up and say `` here 's how I will help you so you do n't have to have an abortion '' .
we waste paper , which is causing people to deplete the world 's forests .
You prove my point exactly . Just because 99 % of scientists believe in evolution , why should I ?

Yet , tehre seem to be people who remember taking the poll . Regardless , in his report it was a minor point . From a realistic standpoint , it took nothing away from the report when he removed it . Lott was investigated for this , just like Bellisiles . He was not found guilty of any academic misconduct ( unlike Bellesiles ) . When you consider the thousands fo data sets that he compiled to put that report together , the folks investigating him did n't think it was at all unbelieveable that he scoudn ; t remeber the details of where that number came from . Again , though , he ended up removing that number from his report ( the single place that it appeared ) and apologised for using it since he could not provide the raw data or a good cite for it . Here is how he responded to the article you link to : http : //johnrlott.tripod.com/malkinsoped.html It is rather interesting , and well documented . It addresses a couple of inacuracies in the article , such as the misconseption that he had attributed the disputed numner to Kleck .

My company offers a high end software product and we provide a support forum for users to discuss problems , techniques , etc ...

I have spoken with a couple of college professors I know about this very topic ( I live in a college town ) and they have both said this is far from unusual in the academic community , especially when publishing controversial work .
Your hypothetical is just that - hypothetical . In reality , a militia would stand small chance against military might .
They both claimed that this was result of the ban on handguns .
Felony arrest , severe mental illness or disturbance ( like the kind that gets you off of felony murder charges because you were found not competent to stand trial , or not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect ) , drug addiction , or treasonous action against the country ( not the current government , but the country itself ) .
The simple fact is , in a civilized society no one has the freedom to do whatever she wants with her own body . Liberty unfettered by morality is the operative rule of anarchy , not civilization . At any given moment , each of us is constrained by hundreds of laws reflecting our moral responsibilities to our community . The most primal of those rules is the obligation of a mother to her helpless child . This is one of the reasons the public outcry against Susan Smith was so intense .
So it 's just a coincidence that nations that ban guns like England have much lower levels of gun violence and murder than the US ? That 's kind of hard to believe . NYC was so effective in reducing crime that the mayor of NYC was invited to Mexico City to help them reduce crime there . So I do n't think the possibility that gun control has been effective in cities like NYC can be ruled out . You may be confusing cause and effect . You would n't walk into a hospital and declare that because there are a lot of sick people in a hospital that hospitals do n't help people get better .

( Los Angeles , California ) California Democrats have wrapped up their annual convention with a resolution supporting same-sex marriage . `` The California Democratic Party is now a leading partner in statewide efforts to ensure that all California families enjoy the legal protections that they deserve , '' said Eric Stern , National Stonewall Democrats Executive Director who addressed the convention . The resolution calls for civil marriage to be extended to same-sex couples . It passed unanimously and as the vote was being taken many delegates displayed signs that read `` AB 19 '' in support of an assembly bill that would extend civil marriage to same-sex couples . The legislation was recently introduced by Assemblyman Mark Leno , an openly-gay Democrat from San Francisco . The vote makes California the fourth state Democratic party to officially call for marriage equality . The Democratic parties of Massachusetts , New York and Washington State have all expressed support for marriage equality , either by resolution or through a state party platform . The Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Protection Act , authored by Leno , is expected to pass through the Assembly Judiciary Committee on April 26 . The legislation would allow gays and lesbians to marry while protecting the rights of churches opposed to same-sex marriage to refuse to perform the weddings . It also has the support of the NAACP
Lets break this down . Most pro-choice advocates think that intelligence is when human life starts , or consciousness or self awareness is what makes an embryo have rights . The Lifers say that it should have rights regardless of its physical state . Now , if I sat a flower pot down next to you , would you tell me it should have rights and that we should make pot smashing murder ? Probably not . BUT , what if that pot started to talk to you . Started to ask you questions about life , and started to ask you where it was and what its purpose was . What if you had a casual conversation with this pot ? Now , obviously , this pot should have rights , am I not correct ?

Maybe if there was a gun culture in the UK the police would have been more used to dealing with gun rampages . Maybe if everyone in the UK owned a gun then someone would have shot this man before he killed so many people . I dont know but I do know that the solution to stopping this happening again does not lie in making guns easier to get ! The USA can have as many guns as it wants but to allow Brits to obtain guns as easy as they can it the States would be madness .
Pro-choice . I think abortion is awful and I would like to see it reduced to the bare minimum .

strictly by word definition , `` sin '' is `` transgression of God 's law '' as described in the Bible . in fact , the Bible is the only source of the law of God , and therefore the definition of sin . `` sin '' can only really only apply to those who believe that the Bible is entirely true ( i.e. , the laws that are allegedly God 's laws are in fact God 's laws ) the theory of evolution directly condradictory to the story of creation in Genesis the problem is , if evolution is indeed true , then the story in Genesis is false . and if Genesis is false , then the Bible is not entirely true . and if the Bible is not entirely true , there is reason to doubt that any other feats of God as stated in the Bible ( including describing his law , and even inspiring man for that matter ) . and if we doubt that the Bible was God 's inspired word to man , then its just a book with a bunch of stories . its like a domino effect so far the validity of the theory of evolution is questionable , and creationists and christians on a whole are clinging to this . I think creation has finally met its match , and both are on a more-or-less even playing field . creationists assert that creation is a fact , evolutionists assert that evolution is a fact , and neither of the two can really dominate as far as evidence , so both are `` theories with holes '' . accepting creation or evolution has come down to a matter of personal belief rather than based on solid truth , as far as I see
but that 's not what the 2nd amendment is for .
`` I think one of the greatest mysteries in biology at the moment is whether natural selection is the only process capable of generating organismal complexity , '' said Massimo Pigliucci of the Department of Ecology and Evolution at Stony Brook University in New York , `` or whether there are other properties of matter that also come into play . I suspect the latter will turn out to be true . ''
So , you 're saying that you believe in absolutely everything your church believes and you support everything it does and the moment it did anything oustide of these you 'd leave right ?
Well , I guess you can refuse to see something that 's pretty obvious . It 's up to you .
Of course , no one expects that you would have made any effort to actually educate yourself before you accepted creationist dogma from someone else who is as ignorant as you . There have been several continuing experiments with anole lizards in the Caribbean . I 'll leave it to you to search the peer reviewed literature for the several papers on the topic . I 'm sure that it wo n't be a problem for you , given your constant quest for knowledge .
Now you 're claiming that a gun is a precision machine . Before you 've claimed that the guns you classify as `` assault weapons '' are `` inaccurate and designed for be fired from the hip '' . Which is it ? ... ..
An attempt by you to dodge the main point .
Two of the things I mentioned ( better locks and security systems ) have an effect at preventing home invasion . Having a gun does nothing to prevent the crime , it only serves to stop it once it has begun .
I suppose the correct terminology would be that G. fortis evolved a smaller beak due to competition from a larger billed recent imigrant . I suppose that we just are n't subjected to the same word selection pressures this side of the Atlantic .
It 's called an analogy . The article claimed that the relationship between homosexuals and discrimination and between gun owners and discrimination is the same because the discrimination in both cases is because of `` who they are . '' Thus , I extended this analogy so that the relationship between gun owners and discrimination and between serial racists and discrimination is the same because the discrimination in both cases is because of `` who they are . '' The analogy that I made was not comparing gun owners to serial rapists , but rather , it was comparing the relationship of the two groups with discrimination .

Rocks tell the truth to those who interrogate them throughly and with an open mind . To others the rocks say whatever their interrogator chooses them to do .
This is why the title is `` God exists ! ! ! ( but he 's not who you think he is ) . It 's a funny proof which I do n't think Christians would agree this definition was God . But basically it 's saying that take the set of all human beings . Call the greatest God . God exists . Not only that , but the final conclusion is one of the premises . The proof is one big circle
I also find it hard to believe some of what gets posted in favor of the slippery slope argument- such as claims that Sarah Brady wants all guns to be banned which are contradicted by quotes by her in credible online sources
This post definately is n't up to your typical standards Greg . That 's some pretty poor logic . Waxy
Off course , you might be trying to infer that because their are differences of opinion in the field of evolution makes the whole notion irrelevant . I disagree , but if you insist we will examine differences in opinion between different groups within , lets see ... ... ... how about Christianity ? Do they make the whole religion completely rejectable ?

I do not believe abortion is generally about convenience because preganancy is more than mere inconvenience . Even if she does not have to raise the child , it does not mean she is emotionally , mentally , physically , or economically able to support a pregnancy . I have frequently suggested finding ways of bringing abortion down by addressing these issues - but according the lifers around here these problems do n't exist and all that needs to be done is taking punitive measures against women . But then - when they take that stance they really do lose all credibility . At least for me . Would n't leave my kid alone with someone who loves like that .
you 're on the right track ; the problem with evolution is that it has no verifiable creator -- the fact is , mutations ( which supposedly add new raw material for selection ) have never shown to add any new structure or even a new part to any existing structure . It 's a sad fact for evos .

I know you think I was acting emotional with my post and it really is hard to tell whether someone is being emotional over a forum since it is so impersonal . What I can say is that posting about the Bible has become a mere formality to me and not the emotional debate it used to be . However , I believe it is necessary to eliminate the Bible from debates of this sort by discrediting it right away . Then at least we can focus on real solutions based on what is real instead of what some weirdo wrote thousands of years ago .
All things are subject to the Will of God the Creator . Nothing exists or can exist that is not subject to God 's Will .
But what 's REAL truth ? The real truth is evolutionists ca n't even get that right . The real truth is that members of the same species almost always work together for the benefit of the population .
New information applies to my definition of evolution , i.e . molecules to man evolution . You see , everything is supposed to have come from some single-celled creature that supposedly came from some primeval sea , a.k.a . lifeless chemicals . Now for things to evolve , or become more complex , massive amounts of genetic information , or DNA , must be added to a creatures genome ( the total DNA content ) . Therefore , evolution must provide a mechanism that provides a way for new genetic information , DNA , to be added to the genome . Currently , mutations , natural selection and no other evolutionary process can not account for this . Information is the DNA , or I should say that DNA is a very complex information system . When I say an addition of new information , I mean more letters or more DNA added to the overall total DNA content .
Sarah Brady is a straw purchaser then . She knowingly broke the law by buying a gun for somebody else instead of letting them go through the NICS check system . Who knows what else she 's done and who she 's supplied guns to .

Your analogy is very flawed . One , it does not involve me living off of your organs and life processes . Two , you violated my legal rights by kidnapping me in the first place . Three , we would both be conscious , thinking and feeling beings with enforceable rights and four , if you had not violated my rights but I was violating yours by requiring you to feed me then you would have the moral authority to stop if you wished to , even if I died without it
Thompson ignores a second important distinction . In the violinist illustration , the woman might be justified withholding life-giving treatment from the musician under these circumstances . Abortion , though , is not merely withholding treatment . It is actively taking another human being 's life through poisoning or dismemberment . A more accurate parallel with abortion would be to crush the violinist or cut him into pieces before unplugging him .
If a naturalistic interpretation of natural events and processes is ever to be replaced , it is more likely that it will be by a newer , better evolution of the naturalistic concept than by goddidit .

You are correct . I did not know that S Africa had abolished the death penalty . No death penalty=no death penalty for firearms posession . S Africa has the most restrictive gun laws on the planet . They also have the highets murder rate in the western world . Just another example from the real world of why the gun control crowd are a bunch of illogical XXXXXX .

What makes a rape and incest baby any less precious then a regular baby and why it is okay to abort them but not the later ?
If all life evolved from a common ancestor , then there should be countless instances of new body parts evolving . Body parts such as eyes , muscle , bone , etc . We have not seen one instance of a new body part evolving in a population in which it has not existed previously . Evolutionists will wave the magic `` time wand '' and simply claim that such a change could never be observed in a few decades . What about fruit flies ? One generation of fruit flies = around a day . Fruit flies were exposed to x rays to speed up mutation rates , we have observed the equivalent of millions of years ( in terms of human generations ) of super-accelerated mutation and ... . no new body parts . Evolutionists will also list in steps how a new body part can arise . This is only plausible if each of those steps could be directly observed . If not , then it is nothing more than science fiction . Evolutionists have been searching for any direct evidence of the theory of evolution since the 1800 's . They are still looking .
If anything it should be their creation stories of the Sioux , etc . that should be taught over that of Christians ( the invaders and slaughterers of the indigineous people ) .
You folks ca n't box with God , your arms ai n't long enough . Many arguments are made about whether creation or evolution should be taught in our schools . I believe in creationism because I have never met an evolutionist who can explain where the very first sign of life came from . Can something not alive give birth to life ? Can something not alive change to be alive ? The answer to both questions is NO ! There are many things I do n't know , but two things I do know are science will never create anything from nothing and science will never create life from nonlife . I still think that it takes more faith to believe in evolution than it does to believe in our creator

While this may be somewhat unclear , it is clarified if you take an apple and a pear . You now have two fruits . However , you will notice that there is no fruit in reality , only apples , pears , peaches and so on . Fruit is an abstract concept . That abstract concept exists only as a set of criteria within our minds . Even so , these concepts are not universal , which is immediately obvious once you notice the various things people consider fruit even though they fail to meet some criteria , thus showing their non-universality .

I personally think that abortion is wrong . I think that a fetus is still a baby . I do think that abortion can be okay but only if the mother 's life is in danger , otherwise they should live with it . They should have stayed away from the causes of pregnancy .

Well , Satan was invented to explain why there is evil in the world.. the dualism . He was adopted by the Hebrews under the influence of Persia . However , in the Jewish religion , Satan is not this incredilbly evil being out to corrupt souls , but rather just an angel ( who had no free will ) , whose job it was to provide for bad choices so that people may choose GOOD , and thus live more sanctified lives by their own actions .
Why do women opt for abortion over adoption ?

There are several fallacies with Darwin 's theory of evolution :
Except that that would be the author 's words , not a direct quote . Notice the absence of quotation marks ? Special Agent Newell never said `` 17 % came from the US '' . The author has as much trouble with the stats as you . 17 % of the total have been traced to the US . We do n't know the percentage of the total that did indeed come from the US but is untraced or untraceable . See the difference ?
After something happens , it 's easy to go back and take a look and analyze what could have been done in order to prevent it beforehand . That does n't do much good after the crime has already been committed . Most people do n't purchase guns and sit up late at night hoping a prowler comes along so they can blow them away . The gun is there so , if your other measures fail for any reason , you are not defenseless in a face to face confrontation . Heck , there are plenty of cases where criminals are scared off once they realize somebody is home and armed .
Maybe they just drink too much coffee . And you probably work with more `` reefer heads '' than you think .

It 's nice to think that you 'll 'plan ' a child later but , life seldom works that way . I 'd hate to think that once you 're finally ready to have a child , your uterus has been scarred to infertility or have sever complications in conception , carrying the child to term or delivery . I 'd be ironic for another yuppy type who ca n't have children on their own due to an abortion to have to incure greater medical costs to have one or legal costs to adopt ... and maybe even seeking a foreign child as there are n't any easily to be had here ... since they were all aborted . Also , the older you get , the more health issues possible for the child .
* There is abundant evidence that many of the rock strata were laid down quickly , one after the other , without significant time breaks between them . For example , preservation of ripple marks requires rapid burial , as in the Flood ( e.g . lower Triassic rock , England ) . Folding of sedimentary rock without cracking or heating , such as at Eastern Beach , Auckland , New Zealand , suggests the folding occurred before the sand and mud had time to turn into stone , consistent with rapid deposition during the Flood .
I get the `` idea '' that carbon 14 dating is only accurate to 4,500 years old ( the time of Noah 's Flood [ or for you , `` The Flood '' ] ) because of the massive changes that would have happened to the Earth and it 's atmospheric composition with the natural forces leading up to and during the flood , including many , many , volcano erruptions .
Whatever . As far as I am aware , ( generally ) the only proposed mechanism for any of the alternatives to Darwin is natural selection , which is a gradual , slow process which I have demonstrated to be unable to produce the 40 interacting , well matched protein parts necessary to the flagellum . Now , if you have some kind of other mechanism besides luck , enlighten me instead of alluding to it .
Not one that a solid case can be made for . If it happened they would be numberless just as Darwin said ...
I believe in Spinoza 's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists , not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings . I can not imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation , whose purposes are modeled after our own -- a God , in short , who is but a reflection of human frailty . Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body , although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotisms . A man 's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy , education , and social ties and needs ; no religious basis is necessary . Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death . Scientific research is based on the idea that everything that takes place is determined by laws of nature , and therefore this holds for the action of people . For this reason , a research scientist will hardly be inclined to believe that events could be influenced by a prayer , i.e . by a wish addressed to a Supernatural Being .
There are no beneficial mutations. This is not true , since some changes do confer an advantage in some situations . Rather , we should say , We have yet to find a mutation that increases genetic information , even in those rare instances where the mutation confers an advantage. For examples of information loss being advantageous , see Beetle Bloopers : defects can be an advantage sometimes , New eyes for blind cave fish ? and Is antibiotic resistance really due to increase in information ?

City Hall & # 8211 ; Speaker Christine C Quinn , together with Council Member Al Vann , today announced legislation that would increase penalties for selling a toy gun by 500 percent . The legislation would also enhance the Department of Consumer Affairs & # 8217 ; enforcement ability and allow the agency to shut stores that are repeat offenders of the law . Department of Consumer Affairs ( DCA ) Commissioner Jonathan Mintz and Criminal Justice Coordinator John Feinblatt joined the Speaker and Council Members at the announcement . The officials also announced a new citywide public awareness campaign about the dangers of toy guns that look real and real guns that look like toys . & # 8220 ; Despite the fact that New York City & # 8217 ; s toy and imitation gun law has been in existence for several years many merchants continue to sell items that resemble real guns , & # 8221 ; said Council Speaker Quinn . & # 8220 ; Our communities are at risk when they can not tell a fake toy gun from a real one and the dangers these items present are all too real . Children have been hurt and even killed as a result of these guns being out in our communities. & # 8221 ; The City Council & # 8217 ; s Consumer Affairs Committee will hold a hearing on the legislation this afternoon . The proposed bill would increase the fine for a first violation from $ 1,000 to up to $ 5,000 . It would also increase the fines for subsequent violations within a two year period from $ 3,000 to up to $ 8,000 . Finally , it would also permit DCA to seal , for up to five days , the premises of a store found guilty of three or more violations within a two year period . Current law imposes a fine of up to $ 1,000 but does not increase that amount for subsequent violations . Since 2002 , DCA has removed more than 7,200 imitation guns from the shelves of nearly 240 stores throughout the city and levied $ 2.4 million in fines . Today , the City also announced a new subway advertising campaign , to be displayed in 2,100 subway cars , all 468 subway stations and more than 5,400 buses . The campaign warns New Yorkers of the dangers of realistic-looking toy guns and the dangers of real guns that are painted to look like toys . The campaign & # 8217 ; s advertisements demonstrate potential confusion about gun coloration and warn people that it is illegal either to make a fake gun look real or make a real gun look like a toy . New Yorkers are encouraged to call 311 about either problem . Calls to 311 that concern real guns that look fake will be forwarded to the Police Department & # 8217 ; s Gun Stop hotline . Callers can receive a $ 1,000 reward for information that leads to a conviction and can remain anonymous . The City has received a grant from the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services to support the ad campaign . & # 8220 ; Gun violence is plaguing the Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights neighborhoods that I represent , as well as communities across the city and country , & # 8221 ; said Council Member Al Vann , prime sponsor of the bill . & # 8220 ; When I introduced this legislation , my intentions were also to stem the glorification of guns within our communities , and push the businesses that we patronize to be responsible members of our neighborhoods . I will continue working to address gun violence and its underlying issues . In light of the senseless shooting that occurred in my district Sunday night , it is apparent that we must work more diligently to stem the violence that is afflicting our neighborhoods. & # 8221 ; & # 8220 ; There is little debate that realistic-looking toy guns pose a serious threat to the safety and welfare of police officers and New Yorkers as a whole , & # 8221 ; stated Deputy Majority Leader Leroy Comrie . & # 8220 ; Sadly , violence resulting from toy guns has happened too many times in this city . This bill is a common sense solution to a very serious threat to our safety. & # 8221 ; & # 8220 ; Toy guns that look real and real guns that look like toys threaten the safety of our dedicated police officers and our children , especially during this holiday season , & # 8221 ; said Criminal Justice Coordinator John Feinblatt . & # 8220 ; This public awareness campaign will help to educate the public about the dangers posed by these guns. & # 8221 ; & # 8220 ; Imitation firearms that look real are not party items to be wrapped up and given as gifts during the holiday season , and they & # 8217 ; re certainly not toys , & # 8221 ; said Consumer Affairs Commissioner Jonathan Mintz . & # 8220 ; DCA appreciates the Council & # 8217 ; s strong and unequivocal message to the City & # 8217 ; s retailers who must do right by their customers and their communities by keeping these dangerous items off their shelves forever. & # 8221 ; & # 8220 ; With the holiday season in full swing , it is particularly important to bring attention to the fact that toy guns can cause accidents resulting in serious injury or death , & # 8221 ; said Council Member Maria del Carmen Arroyo , Co-Chair of the Black , Latino and Asian Caucus . & # 8220 ; Time and time again our communities are at risk and at serious danger when someone carries what is perceived to be a fake gun . I want to thank the Speaker and the Administration for strengthening the penalties in hopes that repeat offenders cease to sell improper toy guns. & # 8221 ; & # 8220 ; Last month an there was an unfortunate incident in my district where a young teen was shot by police because they mistook his toy gun for a fake one , & # 8221 ; said Council Member Larry Seabrook . & # 8220 ; We need to hold these toy gun sellers accountable for selling such a heinous product . Our children & # 8217 ; s lives are at stake . It is my hope that these penalties will finally deter stores from selling these toys . Our communities need to work together . I ask when they see someone selling bad toy guns or when they see someone concealing a real gun for a fake one to call 311. & # 8221 ; & # 8220 ; This legislation will help prevent further violence by deterring businesses from selling toy guns that look real , & # 8221 ; said Council Member Melissa Mark-Viverito . & # 8220 ; The increased regulations created by this bill will not only prevent toy guns from being used to commit crimes , but also will avert children from being wounded or killed by confused police officers who mistake their toy for a real gun. & # 8221 ; & # 8220 ; Harlem Mothers S.A.V.E . fully supports the action to increase penalties for store owners who are repeat offenders of the law and we agree that the city should have the authority to shut down such establishments and prevent their further endangering lives of our children and safety of community , said Jackie Rowe Adams , Co-founder . Under New York City & # 8217 ; s Public Safety Law , it is against the law to sell or offer to sell any toy or imitation firearm that can reasonably be perceived to be an actual firearm unless the exterior surface of the toy or imitation firearm is predominantly brightly colored . The range of acceptable colors includes white , bright red , bright orange , bright yellow , bright green , bright blue , bright pink or bright purple .
We , and the law , must stand firm against terrorists like Scott Roeder .
How do you explain the change of appearance of the animals over time , as recorded by fossils ?
I 'm sorry but the baby is a part of both of them . Should it be that the mother decides to keep the baby and the father want 's her to terminate the state will still come chasing for child support . Why the father did n't get a say on if the baby was born or not so why should he have to pay child supportbecause the law says so .
pandion : I thought I had worded my post quite clearly . I even pointed out that it appeared that Dembski thought that there were only three laws of thermodynamics and claimed to have discovered a 4th ( which he of course named the 4th law of thermodynamics ) . He seems unaware of the zeroth law .
You may be right , you may be wrong . It does n't matter to me either way because the Constitution allows the states to do as they wish regarding abortion .
In regards to who wrote these books , the best evidence we have leads to Homer . Therefore , we decide it is almost certainly Homer who is the author . This is undisputed .
He was declaring war on an unclean people whom He commanded the Jews to wipe out in a time of WAR .
And he accomplished all this human carnage without a gun . This just proves that if it was possible to eliminate all projectile firing weapons from existing on earth , men would find a way to commit atrocities against his own kind just as he did before such weapons existed if murder was in his heart . Guns are not the issue , the corrupted heart/nature of humanity is .
This contradiction between the fossil data and the predictions of evolutionary theory falsifies the theory.38
I think if anyone took to this they 'd find themselves asked to leave establishments routinely .
It means life is holistic , not reductionist . Life , as is the genome , is a system -- an irreducibly complex system -- not an assortment of pieces that just happen to be fitted together over time via random genetic changes culled by nonrandom death .
the fact that you think life can be created out of non-life in 10 years show how little you know about biology

How about you let me speak for myself ? It 's a given that criminals do n't obey laws . Why labor that point ? If the record of private party sales is kept with a FFL doing the background check , as is the case with initial sales , trace data could be available to law enforcement . The manufacturer would have to know where to point LE of course , since the FFL that corresponds to the serial number would no longer have a record of the current owner . Probably time I look into specifics of how it works in CA .
How does it not refute creationism ? Creationism states that the world is 7,000 years old . Carbon dating is only accurate up to a point , and that point is WELL beyond creationism 's statements .
It always amazes me to hear people with positions like this insist that it is okay to play fast and loose with their interpretations of Genesis or the Arc , but God really does hate the homosexuals . It says so in Leveticus , right ? So it must be word perfect truth ...
In fact , the medical establishment has made it illegal to treat any disease without FDA-approved drugs . Disease can officially be treated either by drugs or surgery in this country ... .anything else is illegal .
Most abortions are consentual , no one FORCED them to have consentual sex . So , instead of women taking accountability for their actions , they will FORCE their views on another human being ... die you sucker die . You are right , we need to stop FORCING people . Lets start with the mother shall we ?
Who 's to say that anyone Bush might appoint would n't strike down a constitutional amendment that bans gay marriage ? The justices are not to be the puppets of the legislature or the president . Do n't forget Richard Nixon 's appointment of Harry Blackmun .
Or by not granting them to the child you are endangering the rights of the child carried by the woman . You are giving her a dictatorship .
Many countries already ban private gun ownership . Rwanda and Sierra Leone are two notable examples . Yet , with more than a million people hacked to death over the last seven years , were their citizens better off without guns ?
I 'm afraid you 're wrong , as I created you in my universe , and implanted in you a belief that you were a god . It lead you to make statements about the truth of your own beliefs , which I 'm afraid are just self-beliefs with no real evidence . Sorry .
Homosexuals are attracted to adults of the same sex . Pedophiles are attracted exclusively to children . There are people , such as the case with these priests , who molest children , who are not pedophiles . Molestation , like rape , is n't about sexual attraction . It is VIOLENCE . People do n't molest or rape because they are so turned on they ca n't help themselves , they do it to HURT somebody . Get some information before shooting off at the mouth VOR . Most of those priests were probably niether gay nor pedophiles . I HATE IT - when people spread this **** . It is FALSE information that does nothing but HARM . It puts blame on the innocent while the guilty get ignored and children get hurt . Do not use this lie to justify your bigotry - for you do so at the cost of innocent people - adults and children .
By multi-formation you mean spontaneous , simultaneous mutations in all the related genomes ?
Like most other natural history museums today , the Museum of the Earth takes visitors on a journey through time , telling as fact the 4.6 billion year history of the Earth. But visitors will never get an opportunity to check the assumptions at the foundation of this story .
I 'm still having a hard time with this . If nothing exists , no matter , then how can `` the number one '' exist ? On what basis is it defined ? If there is only nothing , then you ca n't add to it , like I said 0+0=0 . I know this is getting slightly off topic and philosophical , but it would seem to me that `` concepts '' , and I 'm not sure exactly how that 's being defined , must have a basis in reality , and therefore in matter . I agree in that they are not created . I disagree in that IMHO , they are a function of our physical universe . IMHO , you do n't have the concept without the universe to `` define '' it . I do n't know , it 's too early in the AM , maybe someone can point out the errors in my thinking . Waxy
And the backlash against activist judges in Mass . continues :
So , your refutation is incorrect , as shown above .
Hmm , abortion debate ... walks away very very slowly .
An immaculately presented response , entirely avoiding the topic , or indeed reason , in order to unwittingly further the case for retrospective abortion .
And like usual , you are wrong . Abiogenesis - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia
Interesting . What you call a fine for non-compliance , I call a benefit FOR compliance . There are lots of examples of laws designed to promote social changes . Tax codes that favor married couples is but one example . Another would be IRAs . Uncle Sam rewards people for saving money by deferring taxes on that money . It rewards home owners with deductions for mortgage interest . I do n't see rewarding hetero marriage as being any different . The government is promoting hetero marriage .
ON the subject of your starting arguments , I notice you selectively ignored my view that I posted . Could n't come up with an argument ?
`` [ ... ] the right to health , to home , to work , to family , to culture -- is false and illusory if the right to life , the most basic and fundamental right and the condition for all other personal rights , is not defended with maximum determination . ''
The fact that these newly found feathered species are predecessors to T. rex implies that a lot of theropods had feathers so the evolution of the feather must have begun even before then . Who can say if T. rex had any feathers at all . It 's said that they lived in a pretty warm climate so they would n't really need feathers .

Should it be legalized ? Yes . Is it harmful ? No , not nearly as much as alcohol or tobacco . Should it be taxed once legalized ? Yes . Should laws still aply to it , such as DUIs and the like ? Yes .
The report is very recent . Lack of action by the ATF within a few days of a report being released is not evidence of anything . Secondly , the ATF ca n't just walk into a gun show and randomly choose people to investigate . They have to have specific information about the identity of people suspected of breaking the law at gun shows before investigating . So unless they are given such information about the sellers in the NYC report they ca n't do anything .
While I again feel that it should be assumed he would do so to begin with , I can agree that a simple answer as you say would have been easy enough .
The Washington DC city council has turned down ballot initiatives to allow the people of DC to vote on this issue ( as well as some other issues recently ) . Considering the amount of support these initiatives appeared to have I think were going to see some new blood on the council soon . They have made some decisions of late that have n't sat to well with the people of DC , this appears to be one of them .
That 's your problem . Any other subjects on which you are delusional ? probably ... .I think anyone who kills an unborn child with a knife to the head is a murderer . Does that make me delsional ?

Evolutionists ' Biological Fairytale This time last year I was lost . Im not generally the type of individual who blames my own personal issues on other people , but the fact is I was mislead and lied to by science and by the media .
I 'm curious as to everyone 's opinion on this . My opinion is that if one 's right , the other must be too .
And finally in regards to what God is like ... certain religions say God has certain characteristics ... all loving , all powerful , omniscient ... Some of these characteristics contradict observations we see today ( how can an all loving god allow pain and suffering among the innocent ) .

Well , that makes no sense at all That 's like saying atheists love the idea of a number so big that no number could be bigger .
I think I 'm getting what you are saying here , and I sort of agree . It is both the body and the mind that make a person , and each are important . If you have one without the other- the body ( very underdeveloed in this case ) without the mind in the case of a foetus , it does not make a person .
You 're the one who 's clueless if you think Republicans had zero to do with this legislation . Like they were n't partying Black Friday . Or Lieberman is n't a Republican to begin with .
Fistulas are a scourge of the poor , affecting two million women and girls , mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia  those who can not get a Caesarean section or other medical help in time . Long neglected , fistulas have gained increasing attention in recent years , and nonprofit groups , hospitals and governments have created programs , like the one in Dodoma , to provide the surgery .
Instead of running your filthy little immature foul mouth , why do n't you tell me how protein survives for 68 million years ?
The fact is foundit , that creationists and I-Ders understand that there are so many unanswerable questions , so we know we ca n't answer them for certain , because Man just does n't have the knowledge to discern the truth from the minutia .

Do guns really deter burglars ? Here 's an interesting study . `` In one sample of state prisoners , 74 percent agreed that one reason burglars avoid residences when people are at home is that they fear being shot . At the same time , burglars also report that guns are of considerable value to them ... . Interviews with active burglars suggest that they typically prefer items that are easy to carry , easily concealed , and have high 'pound for pound ' value . As one burglar reported : 'A gun is money with a trigger ' ... .Results from the Uniform Crime Reports and NCVS data suggest that gun prevalence may increase the odds of being burglarized . Our analyses find that a 10-percent increase in a county 's gun ownership rate is associated with a 3-percent to 7-percent increase in the likelihood that a home will be burglarized . The likelihood that a burglary is 'hot ' ( that is , that a resident is at home during the break-in ) does not appear to be affected by the prevalence of gun ownership ... .One possible reason why the risk of burglary increases with gun prevalence is that guns are valuable loot ... .Keeping a gun at home is unlikely to provide a net benefit to the rest of the community in the form of burglary deterrence . If anything , residences in a neighborhood with more guns may be at greater risk of being burglarized . The upshot is ironic : Guns are often kept to protect the home , but the aggregate effect of keeping guns at home may be to increase the victimization rate . '' http : //www.jointogether.org/gv/news/ ... 566426,00.html Criminals fear being shot , but they also want to steal guns .
By default via uber govt regulation , yes .
I personally can not find fault witht he intelligent design folks who feel that god guided evolution
For a 13 year old girl that could greatly damage her body to have a pregnancy so young . She is just starting to grow and mature , and its not healthy , natural , or right to have a pregnancy at that age . She could cause alot of damage being that young .
well , if you are right then think about it : they considered millions of people inferior so they made the choice for them I imagine . so the Nazis were pro-choice
Yes , you would be wrong .
According to this year 's FBI Uniform Crime Report , the use of guns in crime rose significantly from 1985 to 1993 . However , since implementation of the Brady Law in February 1994 , there has been a significant drop in the percentage of violent crimes committed with a firearm . A study by The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence showed that , since it 's enactment , the Brady Law background check kept handguns out of the hands of over 312,000 prohibited purchasers - including 113 felons a day . http : //www.bradycampaign.org/facts/r ... h/bradyred.asp
Still , some scientists worry that the use of war metaphors has negative effects on both science and the scientists who adopt the language .
Personally , I feel that abortion is wrong , even if the mother is in danger of loosing her life when the baby is born . Think about , just for a second , not only did God create us , but he also decides when our work for him is over and we can return home to Him . With that in mind , if the mother is in danger of loosing her life , it is God 's will . Her work here on earth is done . Some may argue that `` who cares ? it wasnt alive anyway , and besides , what are the chances that it would have actually done something great like find a cure for AIDS ? '' I have had many people use that in an arguement , well , my answer for them is always `` what are the chances that would n't ? '' Think about it . One of the 3000 or so aborted babies a day , could have found the cure for AIDS or another disease . Another may have found a way to have the closest thing to world peace that we can have .

Well I guess you apparently trust the political bunch and rich and famous .
This is a serious problem that government caused , not the greedy capitalist pigs they would like us to believe . I ca n't imagine an insurance company would agree to coverage of a person who found out he had cancer yesterday and applied for insurance today . They had mandates forcing this on them . Anyone who buys insurance has to make up the loss . There has to be another way to solve the problem .
Your definition of `` children '' is questionable .
Too late , drug usage has already created those epidemics . Legalizing drugs may increase some of them temporarily , but they already exist . I would argue that there would be a decrease in crime , for certain .
Whether an all-out ban on guns is good or bad ( or constitutional ) , or an assault-weapons ban is good or bad ( or constitutional ) , it should be obvious to any reader that the Columbus city council is trying to push through an all-out ban on guns by calling this an assault weapons ban .
OK simone , what 's your point ?
I 'm just waiting for a logical arguement to debate against . I have n't heard one yet . Neo-darwinism is more than just gasping for air -- it 's stone-cold dead .
The pious wringing of hands and croc tears over the murder rate here versus the rate some where else is unbelieveable . Instead of blaming XXXX poor police work and a joke of a criminal justice system it has to be lack of gun control .
2 ) The need to display information from a reputable source . Just to clarify Flynt is Larry Flynt since you seemed to leave this detail out . This transcript comes from a bulletin board and the sources it cites are at places like gwbushnotmypresident.com and atheist.org I 'm sure neither of these websites has an agenda . The end of the post displays an anti-Republican manifesto showing that the person who posted it did it with such impartiality . I 'm sure they are focusing on being fair and balanced .
`` ... guns intimidate and make people uncomfortable . '' Crazy Californians .
... the scientific outlook making people mistake religious meaning for scientific meaning , causing them to either think the Bible must be scientifically true because it 's religiously meaningful , or that it must be religiously meaningless because it 's scientifically false . Richard Dawkins and the average creationist make the same fundamental mistake - the greeks would say they mistook 'muthos ' ( myth , allegory ) for 'logos ' ( reason , science )
What is ? Whether abortion is right or wrong is a matter of opinion , unless you 're trying to say that everyone who supports it secretly is against it .
There 's plenty of people here with more science than I . Does anyone know of science tests for 'dark ' ? If not , would this not suggest that it is non-material ?
To answer your question , yes I would support abstinence to protect anyone 's health , not just women 's . Risks of STIs including AIDS and unwanted pregnancy are obvious examples that can be largely avoided by not having sex . Cervical cancer is triggered by a virus that a woman is exposed to through sex . Even if she does not contract any STD , there is a high correlation between rates of cervical cancer , HPV ( human papolloma virus ) , and having intercource . Cervical cancer almost never occurs in virgins , and there is a high rate of occurrence in women who have had multiple sex partners . Abstinent women also have lower rates of urinary tract infections and vaginitis . Those can be caused by skin being dragged into the vagina inadvertently during intercourse , and the penis has bacteria on it just like all skin . Teenage girls also would obviously have higher levels of academic achievement if they are abstinent . Less depression and emotional turmoil due to relationship problems if they are abstinent , as well as less domestic or partner abuse . However , I do n't believe that advocating abstinence only is a smart way of approaching a problem . Obviously very few people are abstinent all of their lives ; intercourse is a normal part of a healthy lifestyle . Preaching abstinence-until-marriage is also an unreachable goal and means nothing to same-sex couples . Furthermore , there is little scientific evidence that shows that abstinence only education works . Research demonstrates that comprehensive sex education , including abstinence and contraception , is the most effective , according to well-respected groups including the American Medical Association , the American Academy of Pediatrics , the Society for Adolescent Medicine , the Institute of Medicine , the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association . All of these groups reject abstinence only programs in favor of comprehensive sex education . The Institute of Medicine recommends `` Congress , as well as other federal , state and local policymakers , eliminate the requirements that public funds be used for abstinence-only education and that states and local school districts implement and continue to support age-appropriate comprehensive sex education .

The Republicans learned during the Clinton years that creating as much as paranoia as possible about the Democrats supporting big government is the way to regain a majority in Congress . It 's all politics .
Secondly , even if the western world were to actually reduce the amount of grains AND meat it consumed , this would leave them with a whole bunch of money left over , which would then be diverted into other consumables , which may be more carbon intensive than the food production process . I 'd bet that many american families finding themselves with an extra $ 10 a week in their pockets would spend it on petrol , air con , plasma tvs , cars , apartments . So the impact on carbon emissions may well be positive instead of negative .
do you really want to let that creature die out when you start another creature from scratch ? i wouldnt .
Big bangs can not produce the order that we see in the planets .
This is no different than the discredited Kellerman study !
Which planet in your parallel universe did this happen on ? You should stick to topics on which you know something ... ... ... ... ... Oh , sorry , I see your problem .
Sure , we 've always had murder etc . But now we 're seeing exploitation of the un-born , old people no longer needed - ( euthanasia ) , etc . You 're looking at the micro level . When I look at macro evils , such as the millions killed by atheists in China , North Korea and other secularist states I do n't think there 's any comparison .
Each individual has the right to self defense no matter what their IQ , or no matter how `` dumb '' they appear to be . There are set standards and `` guidelines '' most states have set up in order to determine whether or not a person `` qualifies '' to carry a gun . While I understand the purpose , and I understand what these state CCW qualifications are designed to do , I am NOT comfortable with the idea of having the state use any method to determine if I `` qualify '' for a right . Do you have to pass a qualification for free speech ? How about a test to see if you can go to church ? Do you have to fill out a questionairre to get protection from illegal search and seizure ? Each and every individual , regardless of their intelligence , should have the right to defend their lives in the most efficient manner they choose . Are there some people out there who just should n't have a gun ? Of course . There is a method used to weed these people out . When they do something illegal or truly `` dumb '' , the cops arrest them and take away their legal ability to carry . Until that time EVERYONE deserves the right to carry a gun , no matter where they fall on your personal intelligence scale .
All creationists have to date things is a BOOK . Paleontology uses scientific methods .
face it -- life has stumped science -- it can not be defined , it can not be measured ... it can not be explained in any sort of scientific way .
You have obviously been told this by a pro-choicer who will leap to any rationale no matter how shallow in order to justify his/her defense for abortion . He fails to appreciate that preventing an egg from being fertilized is not at all similar to murdering a fetus which is in many cases at a minimum of up to 3 months of development . Hi Ryuuichi , If I might defend your doctor for a second , I think I can explain his thinking . He/she understands that what you think you want at 17 yrs . old MIGHT be very different than what you will want when you are in your 20s and in love with your potential soul mate . At that time , when the man of your dreams is real and you two actually discuss your future lives together , if you then decide to get your tubes tied and never have children , he will be confident that your decision is rational and based on a mutual decision with your spouse . See the difference ? To make that decision now could and probably would be greatly regretted since most men you meet in your 20s who fall in love with you will desire to have children with you one day . Very few men would choose to marry a woman who could never give them natural children . In fact , I can say with confidence that to make such a permanent decision without including the man you will fall in love with and want to marry one day is probably the most selfish decision a woman could make . Think about it as a woman in love some day and you will see my point , I 'm sure .
`` ( 22 . ) Criminals , being the lowlife , deviant scum they are , would never be smart enough to anticipate the possibility that their victims might be armed , and would thus never take along guns themselves .

# There were 7,387 black homicide victims in the United States . Of these , 6,345 ( 86 percent ) were male , and 1,042 ( 14 percent ) were female . # The homicide rate for black victims in the United States was 20.86 per 100,000 . In comparison , the overall national homicide rate was 5.30 per 100,000 and the national homicide rate for whites was 3.11 per 100,000 . # For homicides in which the weapon used could be identified , 82 percent of black victims ( 5,743 out of 7,011 ) were killed with guns . Of these , 73 percent ( 4,204 victims ) were killed with handguns . There were 701 victims killed with knives or other cutting instruments , 247 victims killed by bodily force , and 200 victims killed by a blunt object . Hes betrayed his own people !
NO I mean every word of what I type . If they institute these rules I will back off gay claim to marriage and accept that marriage is about children . As long as they continue to let 70 and 80 year olds get married marriage is not about children and there is no reason to exclude gay people . I would also add one more lisencing rule 8 No one may have children with out a marriage lisence .

There will also be a push to repeal the so-called Tiahrt amendment , named after Rep. Todd Tiahrt , R-Kan. , that limits the authority of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives to disclose gun-trace data to the public and requires that certain records submitted to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System be destroyed after 24 hours . Both the Third Way 's Bennett and Helmke said it may take another major gun crime , like the shootings at Columbine High School or Virginia Tech , to get Congress to act on more ambitious gun control initiatives . Those include overturning a law enacted in 2005 that denies gun crime victims the right to sue firearms manufacturers and dealers for damages . Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif. , said she plans to push legislation to reinstate a federal ban on some assault weapons that became law during the Clinton administration in 1994 but expired under the Bush administration in 2004 . Another long-term goal is requiring that all gun shows conduct background checks before selling firearms . The NRA 's Cox said his group is gearing up to fight a new assault weapons ban , noting that Obama supports one and that Attorney General Eric Holder recently linked the proliferation of military-style weapons to the violence along the Mexican border . `` It 's laughable if it was n't so serious to suggest that diminishing the Second Amendment will positively impact the situation down in Mexico , '' Cox said .
I think bringing `` emotions '' into the question of whether God exists or not tends to cloud the issue a bit . Is n't the essence of atheism a rational enquiry which concludes that in the absence of any credible evidence , there is no reason to believe in God ? An emotional attachment to `` non-belief '' would be irrelevant ( and irrational ) .
And yet , in this case , your candidate emphatically says no to supporting gay marriage . And you are n't outraged by that ? That 's what I do n't understand .

how many animals do you think were on the Ark ? how many species existed at the time ? the story of the ark does not coincide with contemporary science , but it does work with the rest of Genesis . this is Genesis 2 : 15-23 now bear in mind that all this happened in one day ( day 6 ) . How many species of animals can a man name in a day ? OK , Noah is 9 generations after Adam , and according to the story , a generation was like 200 years on average , plus at the time Noah built the ark , he was some 200 something himself ( cant remember the exact figure ) . so say its 2000 years or so after the creation day . Anyway , its possible that not a lot of speciation took place in that time , plus its arguable that there wasnt a lot of migration away from the Eden area either . so all the animals in the Earth were relatively close-by , and there couldnt have been a great number of new or variant species from the ones originally created . From the Creation to the Flood , the story makes sense . multiply the number of animals Adam named in a day by 2 , and add 25 % for speciation , and thats the number of animals that needed to be in the ark . sounds logical to me but then again , its just a story ...

mercy and killing should never be put together . there is no such thing as having so much compassion that justifies you putting a toddler to death . Dont people realize that children are gifts and not something that should be taken so lightly as to steep so low in stopping a beating heart all for the sake of selfishness and convenience for one 's self.. There is absolutely no thought whatsoever in the baby , its all about `` how can i live easier without this problem ? `` . there is no such thing as compassionate killing . What it really means is `` killing in the name of mercy for my comfort '' . people need to start realizing that the world doesnt revolve around them and that life itself is a gift TO ALL ! EVEN THOSE LITTLE ONES THAT PEOPLE RIGHT NOW THINK DONT HAVE ANY RIGHT TO LIVE . look in the mirror !
Warsaw : That is your most stupid argument and it really makes me angry . In the ghetto of Warsaw , there WAS an armed uprise . The result ? The Germans massacred thousands as revenge . And if they had more guns , maybe the Germans simply had bombed the whole ghetto with their planes . Please don´t you ever bring on any arguments against gun-control by showing examples from the 3 . Reich . Gun-control got nothing to do with the increase of Hitler´s power or the way that WW2 went .

That is the premise of my question . On what basis can one claim that the Constitution makes this arbitrary designation with respect to the death penalty ? I simply do n't see any rational argument for it . So why can not juvenile crimes which would otherwise be death penalty eligible be treated on a case-by-case basis ? Under the theory of variable neurophysiology development , we could suppose that some individuals under 18 will have a fully developed moral understanding , and also some individuals 18 and over who do not . Fair enough . But I am curious to see if anyone can defend the rationality of the rationale ( whatever it is purported to be ) . You 're obviously not obliged to do that , but that is sort of the curiosity that I have .

You 've seen the ads , `` Buy BRAND X Fat Controller - Results Guaranteed '' by laboratory testing , of course
That website starts off with the rumor that there are over 20,000 gun laws . Although this claim has been repeated numerous times by anti gun-control activists , has anybody been able to verify this claim ? A recent study that counted the number of gun laws found `` only 300 relevant federal and state laws regarding the manufacture , design , sale , purchase , or possession of guns .

Only as far as every murder is evidence of failure of homicide laws . In other words ; to be expected . No law is 100 % successful , and to expect one to be so is unrealistic at best . It would be nice , but that 's an ideal which is more or less unreachable . The fact remains ; it 's a significant reduction , especially in comparison to the standard myths about gun availability in the UK . Did you read the report ? `` One gun on an estate can be used by people you would not expect to be allies . '' So much for buddies . Of course you would rather . One of the options is counter to your agenda ; the other is completely unrelated , not to mention generically trolling . I suppose that 's a sort of consistency ... However , we 're talking about the UK , not Russia . Bit of a difference .
science carries along with it an invisible affirmation of uncertainty . Crick can claim this as fact , but it should be interpreted as `` so far the evidence supports this , and nothing more '' . science only wants to describe observable , natural things . if you think there is more than what we can observe , why do you have to change science ? why ca n't you just start a new school of thought ?

Where are the pro choice people ? What is their position on this ? Can they say that women have inherent value and worth and what is their reasoning ? Are women inherently more valuable than plants and animals and what is the reasoning behind your answer ?
As others pointed out , this is a misconception . I have little doubt that the great majority of pro-choice people are quite positive about wanted pregnancies . I suspect that this misconseption comes from the fact that almost all abortion discussions are about pregnancies that are not wanted . Pregnancies that are wanted are almost never discussed since they are not relevant to an abortion debate . After all , who would want to abort a fetus if they wanted to be pregnant and have a baby ( excluding rare cases of risk of mother 's death , severely deformed fetus , etc . ) ?
The fact remains that you are far more likely to be killed by a heat attack than a criminal . Why are you so worried about criminal activity when there are much more dire threats almost everywhere ?

Usually if you speak to a christian on subjects surrounding creation they come up with `` There are many theories '' . If they were challenged to come up with 1 scientist who believed that humans do not share common ancestry with apes Behe would have been possibly the weak link .

Pregnancy is ALWAYS physically harmful . You try carrying a load of extra weight about and see what that does to your heart . It is also always life threatening - women still die from it and you never know how childbirth is going to go . These are the normal , frequent or expectable temporary side effects of pregnancy : -- exhaustion ( weariness common from first weeks ) -- altered appetite and senses of taste and smell -- nausea and vomiting ( 50 % of women , first trimester ) -- heartburn and indigestion -- constipation -- weight gain -- dizziness and light-headedness -- bloating , swelling , fluid retention -- hemmorhoids -- abdominal cramps -- yeast infections -- congested , bloody nose -- acne and mild skin disorders -- skin discoloration ( chloasma , face and abdomen ) -- mild to severe backache and strain -- increased headaches -- difficulty sleeping , and discomfort while sleeping -- increased urination and incontinence -- bleeding gums -- pica -- breast pain and discharge -- swelling of joints , leg cramps , joint pain -- difficulty sitting , standing in later pregnancy -- inability to take regular medications -- shortness of breath -- higher blood pressure -- hair loss -- tendency to anemia -- curtailment of ability to participate in some sports and activities -- infection including from serious and potentially fatal disease ( pregnant women are immune suppressed compared with non-pregnant women , and are more susceptible to fungal and certain other diseases ) -- extreme pain on delivery -- hormonal mood changes , including normal post-partum depression -- continued post-partum exhaustion and recovery period ( exacerbated if a c-section -- major surgery -- is required , sometimes taking up to a full year to fully recover ) These are the normal , expectable , or frequent PERMANENT side effects of pregnancy : -- stretch marks ( worse in younger women ) -- loose skin -- permanent weight gain or redistribution -- abdominal and vaginal muscle weakness -- pelvic floor disorder ( occurring in as many as 35 % of middle-aged former child-bearers and 50 % of elderly former child-bearers , associated with urinary and rectal incontinence , discomfort and reduced quality of life ) -- changes to breasts -- varicose veins -- scarring from episiotomy or c-section -- other permanent aesthetic changes to the body ( all of these are downplayed by women , because the culture values youth and beauty ) -- increased proclivity for hemmorhoids -- loss of dental and bone calcium ( cavities and osteoporosis ) These are the occasional complications and side effects : -- hyperemesis gravidarum -- temporary and permanent injury to back -- severe scarring requiring later surgery ( especially after additional pregnancies ) -- dropped ( prolapsed ) uterus ( especially after additional pregnancies , and other pelvic floor weaknesses -- 11 % of women , including cystocele , rectocele , and enterocele ) -- pre-eclampsia ( edema and hypertension , the most common complication of pregnancy , associated with eclampsia , and affecting 7 - 10 % of pregnancies ) -- eclampsia ( convulsions , coma during pregnancy or labor , high risk of death ) -- gestational diabetes -- placenta previa -- anemia ( which can be life-threatening ) -- thrombocytopenic purpura -- severe cramping -- embolism ( blood clots ) -- medical disability requiring full bed rest ( frequently ordered during part of many pregnancies varying from days to months for health of either mother or baby ) -- diastasis recti , also torn abdominal muscles -- mitral valve stenosis ( most common cardiac complication ) -- serious infection and disease ( e.g . increased risk of tuberculosis ) -- hormonal imbalance -- ectopic pregnancy ( risk of death ) -- broken bones ( ribcage , `` tail bone '' ) -- hemorrhage and -- numerous other complications of delivery -- refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease -- aggravation of pre-pregnancy diseases and conditions ( e.g . epilepsy is present in .5 % of pregnant women , and the pregnancy alters drug metabolism and treatment prospects all the while it increases the number and frequency of seizures ) -- severe post-partum depression and psychosis -- research now indicates a possible link between ovarian cancer and female fertility treatments , including `` egg harvesting '' from infertile women and donors -- research also now indicates correlations between lower breast cancer survival rates and proximity in time to onset of cancer of last pregnancy -- research also indicates a correlation between having six or more pregnancies and a risk of coronary and cardiovascular disease These are some less common ( but serious ) complications : -- peripartum cardiomyopathy -- cardiopulmonary arrest -- magnesium toxicity -- severe hypoxemia/acidosis -- massive embolism -- increased intracranial pressure , brainstem infarction -- molar pregnancy , gestational trophoblastic disease ( like a pregnancy-induced cancer ) -- malignant arrhythmia -- circulatory collapse -- placental abruption -- obstetric fistula And a few more permanent side effects : -- future infertility -- permanent disability -- death . And I 'm sure I 've missed some . Why the cheap shot against pp ?

And there is nothing surprising about my being able to think for myself and reject the religion of evolution . Both Evolution and Creation must be taken by faith .
# 1 - How are we now able to observe evolution , when the evolution of the world supposely took billions of years ?
How many times have you spammed that argument super ? 10 ? 15 ? 20 times ? CB102 : Mutations adding information CB101.2 : Mutations and new features .
I 'll let you make the first move . After all , it wo n't be any fun unless I see one or two responses ; I 'm not really expecting many more .
Modern-day citizens are far more likely to be aware of the sheer range of religious views in human cultures , past and present , and the consequent improbability that just one of them ( and hey , waddaya know ? It 's mine ! ) is wholly true and all the others wholly false . This leads some into woolly New-Age-ist pick-and-mixing ; others to conclude that the world 's religions are all the product of a similar , purely mundane , process of cultural evolution , and that none actually reflects fundamental truths .
And if you 've ever read any of the speeches by PP 's founder , you 'd also know that every child should be a WHITE CHILD , too . She was an extreme racist and started PP as a means of stopping the increasing number of poor blacks . There was no altruism involved in PP 's `` birth '' .
I am `` curious '' however , why you 're now saying that you are arguing that a tautology is a tautology ? It seems ... misleading the way you try to broaden the tautology of one phrase , to all of evolution , as seen in your statement `` evolution contains tautology '' .

That 's a good one . And I always just thought they were socialists ... ... . Hey , guys , where did all our liberal punching bags go , and why are n't there any new ones ? I have noticed , when debating gun control online , that the victim disarmament crowd shows up wanting to debate . The pro-gunners use facts and logic in support of their argument , and the VD people run away . Usually , it does n't take long for a new one to show up and go `` AH , but I will cut and paste THIS from the Handgun Control Inc webpage , and that will show them ! `` . Then we have a new liberal punching bag . Where are trhe liberals hanging out these days ?
This right of privacy , whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment 's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action , as we feel it is , or , as the District Court determined , in the Ninth Amendment 's reservation of rights to the people , is broad enough to encompass a woman 's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy .

The percentage of that number that have become extinct . ? ? ? ?

Police hunt armed bandits targeting gun stashes in homes Melbourne Australia .
Crime has been dropping nationwide in recent years . Whoopdee do . There are some interesting statistics at http : //www.ncpa.org/pub/st/st176/s176c.html For example : Face it . Gun control is nonsensical . NOBODY has EVER managed to show any benifit from it . At best , it has no effect on crime and at worst it increases it .
Cuts off man 's hand , lacerates his upper body , police say BALTIMORE - A Johns Hopkins University student armed with a samurai sword killed a suspected burglar in a garage behind his off-campus home early Tuesday , hours after someone broke in and stole electronics . Some shocked neighbors said they heard bloodcurdling screams in an area just blocks from the university . Police held the student , a junior chemistry major who turns 21 on Sunday , for several hours , but no charges were filed by early afternoon , said police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi .

I don ' want any more children . My son is nearly ten . That is a pretty big age difference . I especially do n't want to raise any more alone , and I do n't have a big confidence level in men ( my problem due to my history with them - I know there are good ones out there ) . Current conservative legistlation has me worried . Although I am indeed abstinate and have been for years , I ca n't guarentee that in the future . And although I practice safe sex when sexually active , there are remote chances of rape , or the more likely failed birth control . I would not have an abortion unless rape or medical need - so I will do all I can not to get pregnant again - now or in the future . And it sends a message . This body is mine . I choose now - to never be pregnant again - regardless of the circumstances .
Evolution , Darwinian Naturalism ... whatever you want to call it . With all it 's fascistic leverage to create an environment of global acceptance is loosing the intellectual argument because as microbiology develops it is discovering more and more information at the sub-cellular level . These cells can not be anything or produce anything other than what they are ... in other words includes only the information to reproduce itself , ergo ... human skin DNA can not morph into liver DNA , so no fish forming legs , no apes flying planes or creating `` higher order '' intelligence . The whole of evolution is based on chance , chance as causality . That 's it ... a cosmological roll of the dice with impossibility preempting the whole argument - but is suppressed . Fully knowing that chance in itself is not agency - there is no causality in chance , chance is a byproduct of an event therefore can not effect anything , so the equation would look something like : chance + any amount of time = nothing , therefore evolution or any of its pseudo-intellectual ilk are simply impossible .
Seriously ? That 's your reasoning ? By such logic , swimming with sharks means that humans always have coexisted with sharks , including the ancient ones that preceded the dinosaurs . By such logic , since humans can coexist with insects , we must have been around during the carboniferous period .
There is n't an 'evolution mod ' , its just Admin who deals with all of these sort of things and I 've not seen any bias from them at all - a quick look over the rest of the forums shows that there certainly is n't any weighting towards science or religion , . Its probably just a lot of people logging on at once messing with the server ( it finds long posts are particularly delicious , make sure you 've copied a version into word before you click reply ) - you 're not going to get told off for reposting anything . - Supersport There has been a radical change in biology , particularly at the molecular level in less than a decade as how knowledge of how genes work has increasived massively in the wake of the human genome project and the advent of 'omic ' technologies . The person who wrote the article really needs to update this as they are quite a bit behind the times working from a 1998 text book - especially if you 're going to be critising approachs to biotech . A huge amount has happened in the ten years since it was written . She 's also using a few odd terms , DNA - > RNA - > Protein is known as the 'Central Dogma ' of molecular biology and does n't really have much to do with what she is talking about , we already know there were some exceptions to this with retroviruses and we 've only recently discovered that RNA plays a lot larger role than just being an intermediate . On top of this , her 'fluid ' genome is part of the central dogma - its only a very simplistic description of what happens in the cell and does n't really go into all the modifications that the protein and RNA undergo that are n't encoded within the gene . Most of the 4 assumptions have just been made up though , Is clearly wrong , as its never been beleived that one protein = one trait . Prior to the human genome project it was thought that each gene encoded one protein ( hence why the estimates for the total number of genes in the human genome were so high ) but we 've always known that proteins interacted with each other than that many genes will only produce a trait in combination with particular allele of another gene - even Mendel knew that and he did n't even know what the 'inherited particles ' were . Again , we 've know pretty much since the first protein structures were worked out that the mRNA does n't directly translate into the protein and that the translated polypeptide is still not the end protein - that they are both cut up and rearranged . Assumption 3 is pretty much accurate , though we have seen some unusual cases that suggest that susceptability to mutation is heritable and even sometimes selected for ( indirectly at least ) . There are also wierder cases of some microorganisms 'stealing ' genes from other nearby organisms in times of stress . She is misrepresenting how common these things are though and how easy it is to proove this . If we replace 'genes ' with 'sections of the genome ' then she is dead wrong and this is n't a common assumption - transposable elements are a good example of how we know DNA sometimes does this . Basically they are bits of a retrovirus that got 'stuck ' in our genomes rather than producing new viruses - they 've lost most of the coding useful to the virus and now just have enough to write themselves out and them back in again . Post human genome project we know that over 40 % of our genome is actually made up of these broken viruses and other similar elements . Assumption 4 is exactly the same as Assumption 3 - and even now we know that 99.9 % of the time this is the case , however we 're not entirely sure whether she would count the surrounding ecosystem as part of the 'environment ' . We know bacteria can share ( or scavenge ) new genes and viruses can spread , or at least infere with , them as well .
This question is premised on an untenable assumption : that people should not be allowed to vote on particular issues . This premise is clearly not true in any democratic society , and is especially not true in the United States . In the United States , it is a contradiction in terms to say someone is not allowed to vote on X. I have demonstrated this before , and yet the same silly question keeps coming up .
In your analogy I would say they are confusing too . I do n't smoke however it is not because I am against smoking it is because I do n't wan na do it even though I do n't think it is `` wrong '' . This is a far cry from saying you think something is wrong yet support others doing it if they want to .
The difference now is that healthcare in the US is n't a scarce resource .
Of course they do . Just look at Black Phoenix . You would probably be suprised how many people believe just like he does . I live in the Bible belt , so the majority of people I know are creationists .
That analogy does n't work here . It appears that your beef is with the prestige associated with being able to say `` We 're married . '' as opposed to recognizing yourselves as `` same-sex couples with all the rights and privileges afforded married couples '' . The fact is that people are not prohibited from being married because of their sexual orientation . A gay man can marry any woman that will have him . A lesbian can marry any man that will have her . You are not denied the right to marry ... so long as you comply with the rules of marriage ... including the one about one male and one female . Changing definitions just to satisfy the ego of any one group is patently ridiculous . One might ask why we ca n't call ourselves female when we are actually male or why males should n't be allowed to enroll in an all girls school . If it benefits you want , have at it . Work on Congress to come up with something like PACS . If it 's an attack on the definition of marriage , then get lost .
You should check the dates on the posts you reply to . That one is almost 10 months old .
What is conveniently missing from your response ? An explanation of why a limit on the number of guns that can be purchased during a certain time period is not a law which imposes `` conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms '' per Heller .
It 's what I mean when I say that when church and state are separated , atheism and state are combined .
Demand for those parts sure exists because people are trying to hurry and reconfigure their current rifles before DiFi and friends strike again . Do n't expect post-ban prices to go down though , that 's the current cost of parts . If anything , they 'll go up due to lack of supply for a limited time .
What on earth are you talking about ? You have n't done anything to show that the global warming material lacks scientific veracity .

Ummm , no . How could I possibly be forcing my beliefs on you when my view is for each person to have a choice . Your view is to force society to do away with all abortions .
There are hypothesises concerning the fundamental nature of existance . But these concepts are very complex and very few people in the world can even begin to understand them .
Why is this clear ?
Radioisotope dating is done on the rocks that fossils are found in .
So stupendously unlikely is the perfect mutation at the perfect time that calculating the odds against it taking place even once exceeds our imaginative capacity . It is , in fact , a miracle . Now multiply this improbability for all the useful traits belonging to more than fifty million life forms , and you see just how profoundly and irredeemably implausible neo-Darwinism really is .
Again you show that you 're more attuned to atheistic philosophy than scriptural realities .
Yes . I already explained that . An hypothesis is made that explains an observation . Then a prediction is made that can only be true if the hypothesis is true . Then an experiment is designed or a situation established that can test if the prediction is true . They could . I suppose it has been done . I know of one case where anole lizards were transplanted to islands where they did n't exist . Based on previous observation of the lizards in their environment , predictions were made about the physiological changes that should be observed . Those changes were observed . Darwin himself noted the changes induced in domestic animals by the intent of breeders . This is now known as artificial selection . Do n't know . Have you tested your hypothesis ? The debate is n't whether , but how much . Is most evolution gradual as Darwin finally decided ? Or do populations tend to remain relatively constant as long as the environment remains constant ( as noted by Darwin in his notebooks ) ? Good questions . You seem to think that science knows all the answers rather than being a process of looking for answers . There is debate because we are still gathering data about very complex processes . That 's how science works . That 's what the debate is about , sharing ideas with each other .
A woman 's right to choose to keep her legs together is not in any way abridged by this bill . Ho , ho , f***ing ho .

Bonus Question : We do n't know . We credit Homer for the silly reason that a blind guy telling epic stories makes for good imagery . The stories were likely oral traditions passed along and embellished repeatedly .
You ca n't create an artificial minority , wave a magic wand and declare that they should be granted a special status . That not how it should works .
You got numbers ? I 'm curious .
Is it productive to debate something that you do n't understand the concepts of when it 's a fairly involved theory based on scientific evidence ?
They are suggesting that evolution be taught acuratly .
citizens would need to have machine guns , bazookas , shoulder launched missiles , tanks , blackhawk helicopters ,
An intelligent designer would design a system to produce the product as easily as possible .
Which is why it is futile to experiment on individual genes , right ?
Do n't you think any gay person posting here already knew that ? Do you think this comes as any surprise ? I mean really ! Kansas ? ? ? ? I also understand Conneticutt is ready to pass legislation approving civil unions for same-sex couples without court intervention .
Archangel is right on this one . It 's completely absurd to compare a tumour to a healthy fetus , which has a separate blood system , and in a relatively short space of time will be an independent person ...
Anyway , I honestly do n't really see a problem with salvaging things from the dead that are going to benefit the rest of mankind . It sounds icky , and is to a degree but seems better than feeding them to maggots or just burning them
Well , given that your term is a fabrication of the creationist 's mind , I suppose you 're right . Evolutionists do n't actually exist . Therefore you could assign whatever traits you wanted to them , including dishonesty . Evolutionist is a term designed to cast evolution as a faith based notion . The problem is there is no faith in evolution , faith is a belief in something with no proof . Evolution has proof . Therefore it can not be a faith based idea . A typical creationist attack is to misrepresent their target by creating a strawman of it . They then declare it is wrong and by proxy , the actual theory wrong . It 's fundementally weak , but inline with a belief that is scientifically unsound . ]
I 'll respnd [ sic ] to these other replies later .
Jyoshu , if these questions already had a pat and universal answer , it would n't be necessary to ask them in the first place . Since a QUESTION was being asked , it seems fairly reasonable to realize that no ASSUMPTION as to the answer to the question was being made ...

obvious_child and sickdelirium refuse to acknowledge the fact that the observation that the fish are dead is correct . They insist that the observation was wrong . Fossils were found of the fish . No other living fish has been found . Is the observation that all the fish found are dead correct ?
Exodus 11:5 . And every firstborn in the land of the Egyptians shall die , from the firstborn of Pharao who sitteth on his throne , even to the firstborn of the handmaid that is at the mill , and all the firstborn of beasts .
So you support the idea of the government forcing or endorsing families that `` raise their children the right way ? '' And who gets to define that right way ?
Virtually anything !
Wrong . It is a precision machine designed to kill effectively . It can be operated by other than human means .
I never said that the majority of gun owners are racist . If you think that being compared to gay rights activists is somehow demonizing you then perhaps that shows how you feel about gay people . The issue is conservatives using liberal tactics to advance a conservative agenda .
You have made yourself a fool with nothing but names and insults .
Ok so then you are not affraid of a fatty diet ?
You can ignore the obvious question . This is what I find most evolutionists do , they ignore other branches of science that militate against their belief system , and legitimate questions raised by others are dismissed as being ignorant , or worse `` religious '' .
The old school creationists seem to be taking a new tact of proclaiming evolution to be a religion rather than true science . I do n't think this approach is all that new , but I have to admit that I have n't been around as many of the old-school creationists .
True , but as Lurch corrected me before : It is the theory of evolution .
Are these anti-abortion people going to step in and pay for the cost of having the baby , raising it , etc.. ? ? ?
corrected above , thank you , minus the insult that followed . It still stands however as a rational rebuttal .
Ah , but then , it might not have been Homer . But then again , whether it was Homer or someone else , is n't earth shattering .
I guess passing new health care legislation in an effort to help out millions of uninsured people must be the greater offense . As long as the government uses its money to kill people rather than help people then it must be okay .
Does that make rational sense to you ? Just look at the egyptian embalming methods for preserving the Pharaohs . They are still a marvel to modern scientists yet they are nothing more than frail shells no more solid than the texture of a bees nest after a short 3000 to 4000 years in a dry and sealed sarcophagus . Yet bones/fossils buried in the Earth with the upheavals , alkalis and acids in the earth in addition to the weather have survived over 60 million years ? You must ask yourself if sciences explanations pass the smell test in the realm of common sense . And that decision is yours alone .

The laws of physics do n't preclude neural activity impacting physical reality , they require that it take place via a physical mechanism . eg positive thinking may improves serotonin levels and consequently white blood cell production , or some other mechanic .
if the laws of logic are human constructs then how can they be absolute since humans think differently and often contradictorily . If they are produced from human minds , and human minds are mutually contradictory , then how can the constructs be absolute ? Therefore , the laws of logic are not human constructs .
The theory of evolution is not in jeopardy unless we start burning books and outlawing its teaching .
Depends on which cell you mean . Mammalian red blood cells , for example , have had their entire nuclei and mitochondria removed . Not so much as a smidgeon of DNA .

The opposite is actually the case , to deny the sanctity of life is to sacrifice potential families on the alter of the religion of secularism , an extremism which denies humans their right place in nature , which sacrifices the welfare of children to a very narrow and restricted religious belief .
So it 's not evidence vs evidence , it 's evidence vs religious belief .
also , i find it incredibly amusing that no waiting list for an abortion can be longer than nine months . but thats just me .

The article was somewhat contradictory as well , condemning the Court for violating their own precedent ( `` In Roe , the Court for the first time considered liberty to be a psychological , sociological , and economic expression '' ) , while earlier they condemned precedent ( `` Mere precedent is a dangerous source of author i ty , and should not be regarded as deciding questions of constitutional power except where the acquiescence of the people and the States can be considered well settled '' ) . The articles main point , that the `` enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage othe r s retained by the people '' negates Roe v. Wade is erroneous , since the fetus has not been born and the Courts could find no precedent where the Constitution applied pre-natally .

for a creationist to concede to evolution would mean believing that genesis is false , which would mean that the bible is not true , which would mean that it can not be the word of God , which would mean there is nothing to found a God-based religion upon .
The 2nd Amendment was put in place to protect the states from a central government becoming a tyranny just like the one you claim Britain to have been* hence the use of the word militia ... ( of which I have posted court made definitions of on previous posts . ) This law is not a 'natural law ' but one negotiated betwixt various representatives of the colonies/states . Even the amendment re : religion has been changed by the court - in the famous Mormon trail of the late 1800s their freedom of religion was ruled not to extend to the point of polygamy . The statement earlier about the court deciding the law is true . You guys established a referee to determine these matters ; a body of government that 's supposed to be impartial . Most democracies believe that courts can decide . Except in your nation there 's a huge body of opinion that does n't believe this ; if it affects there right to have a penis replacement ... er ... . gun . *In these jingoistic terms you Americans forget that you allied yourself with even more repressive governments viz France and Spain in order to get rid of Britain ( France being so monstrously corrupt that it burst into revolution not long afterwards ; Spain too was no bastion of liberty ) Further in your pursuit of 'freedom ' you invaded Canada several times both in the Revolution and in the War of 1812 . Also , it is estimated that only 1/3 of colonials actively supported the cause of revolution - hardly a picture of a people 'yearning to be free ' . The government 'of the people ' was never true in your early history either . George Washington was n't popularly elected . Women did n't get the vote till c.1920 . Blacks did n't formally get it till 1860s , but were discriminated against in so many areas that you had to pass another amendment in the 1960s ( re : state taxes )
I never considered dna to be junk . I was using that term , [ junk dna ] from what I had read in various 'scientific ' literature .
I think gun registration could stop gun purchases . People would be more hesitant to purchase a gun for another if they knew the gun was legally registered in their name .
the only case that I know of in which a court has ruled that the second amendment is an individual right is US vs Emerson . On the other hand , I know of more than thirty cases in which the courts have supported the militia interpretation of the second amendment .
Sure . The woman is a person , and individual , sentient human being . She has the same right to control her bodily resources as any other person does . As such , you can no more force her , against her will , to provide bodily resources to an embryo or fetus , than you can yourself be forced to give of your bodily resources against your will ... .

I did not mean to go off topic . The point is that sometimes in order for people to see the other side of the coin , you have to beat them in the head with it . That is what the abortion protestors are doing . My example of a simlar strategy came to mind because it was recent . Whether youa re talking war , abortion , whatever , people become complacent . 1000 , or 10,000 , or 100,000 dead mens nothing . Abortion means nothing . Once you start showing pictures of fetuses that look like babies , or showing pictures of little kids who were blown apart during a war ( especially a war that is supposed to be saving them ) , it makes it personal . It drives it home . You are taking an abstract concept like `` dead children '' and giving it substance . I think there are protest similar to what you witnessed in many areas . They are effective . The old days of people milling about in front of an abortion clinic holding signs that say `` abortion kills '' are over becuase it proved to be an ineffective strategy . I support tactics that work in any demonstration . The idea is to get your position out . I am still up in the air on the whole abortion issue , but if the protesters have foudn that the current tactics work better than the old ones , more power to them .
How about the flood ? It was not `` destroyed long ago '' .
Switzerland is the safest country in the world to live in . It is not because it is a neutral country or anything of that sort . I believe it is due to the fact that each male citizen is required to keep a firearm in his home . When every male citizen of Switzerland turns 20 years old , he is issued a fully automatic assault rifle . Every male citizen is on call to defend his homeland if his country calls on him . The Swiss people and firearms go together like peanut butter and jelly . Olympic-style target shooting is Switzerland 's national sport and it is not uncommon at all to see a regular citizen on a train , bus , or just walking down the street with a rifle slung over his shoulder . In Switzerland , there is less than one homicide for every 100,000 citizens each year , and in 99 percent of the cases , a firearm is never involved . There are a mere 26 robbery attempts each year for every 100,000 citizens . The majority of these robberies are committed by foreigners and do not involve firearms . Violent crimes are virtually nonexistent , yet every home has a firearm in it . Surprised ? http : //www.courierpress.com/news/201 ... rearms/ : xhoho :
... merely a projection of the childish wish for the protection of an all-powerful father .
Your argument , I believe . The one I said does n't hold water . It appears to claim that the placing of restrictions upon items specifically designed for the killing of other human beings is somehow comparable to and a prelude for the banning of everyday items whose intended use is in no way connected to harm of others . Your title then equates this with a step towards a form of government in which one person is afforded executive , legislative and judiciary power over the country they control .
[ Anti-Gun Radical Cass Sunstein Could Ban Hunting By Gun Owners of America , A No-Compromise Gun Rights Organization - September 08 , 2009 Icoemail3 Comments ( 66 ) | ( 0 ) Cass-sunstein-250x200_300wide_240high Related Articles * Anti-Gun Cass Sunstein Confirmed - Expect Problems * `` Radical '' Cass Sunstein Will Try to Get U.S. to Give Up Meat * Keep Anti-Hunting Cass Sunstein Out of the White House * Gun Owners Join Opponents of Health Care Reform Bill Just when you thought the news about the Obama administration could n't get any worse , gun owners find themselves needing to rally the troops once again . This time it 's the proposed `` Regulatory Czar '' who will be coming to a vote this week in the U.S. Senate . His name is Cass Sunstein , and he holds some of the kookiest views you will ever hear . For starters , Sunstein believes in regulating hunting out of existence . He told a Harvard audience in 2007 that `` we ought to ban hunting . '' And in The Rights of Animals : A Very Short Primer ( 2002 ) , he said : I think we should go further ... the law should impose further regulation on hunting , scientific experiments , entertainment , and ( above all ) farming to ensure against unnecessary animal suffering . It is easy to imagine a set of initiatives that would do a great deal here , and indeed European nations have moved in just this direction . There are many possibilities . If that 's all Sunstein believed , he would be dangerous and extreme , but not necessarily kooky . Unfortunately , when you look at WHY he wants to restrict hunting , this is where he goes beyond extreme . In Sunstein 's world , animals should have just as many rights as people ... and they should be able to sue humans in court ! `` We could even grant animals a right to bring suit without insisting that animals are persons , or that they are not property , '' Sunstein said on page 11 of Animal Rights : Current Debates and New Directions ( 2004 ) . Well , that 's a relief ... he is at least willing to concede that animals are not persons ! But he would still have animals suing humans , apparently , with more enlightened humans representing the cuddly critters . Imagine returning from a successful hunting trip ... only to find out that you 've been subpoenaed for killing your prize . Who knows , maybe Sunstein would have the family of the dead animal serving as witnesses in court ! By the way , if you 're wondering what he thinks about the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms , you wo n't be surprised to know that Sunstein is a huge supporter of gun control . In Radicals in Robes : Why Extreme Right-Wing Courts are Wrong for America ( 2005 ) , Sunstein says : Almost all gun control legislation is constitutionally fine ... . [ O ] n the Constitution 's text , fundamentalists [ that is , gun rights supporters ] should not be so confident in their enthusiasm for invalidating gun control legislation . Hmm , what part of `` shall not be infringed '' does Sunstein not understand ? Imagine the power that Sunstein could have as the Regulatory Czar -- the nickname for the person heading the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs ( OIRA ) in the White House . As the Regulatory Czar , he could bring about changes in the regulations that affect hunting , gun control and farming . In short , he could make your life hell . Senator Saxby Chambliss ( R-GA ) objected to his nomination several weeks ago , preventing him from being unanimously confirmed . That means that the Senate will now need to garner 60 votes to confirm this radical , kooky choice to the OIRA . No doubt , many of the people our President wants to associate with are radical kooks . First , there was the Rev . Jeremiah Wright ... then there was the self-avowed communist ( Van Jones ) who was nominated for the Green Jobs Czar ... now , there 's an extreme animal rights activist who wants to take away our guns and get Bambi to sue us in court . It 's time to take a STRONG STAND against this radical administration . ]

Kelvin 's already proposed that the armed population of America has given serious protection to the US , specifically he mentioned Japan deciding not to invade . This is of course a nonsense . Iraq is a heavily armed nation -guns were given out to the general population before the USA invaded - ahem- I mean 'liberated ' . Did it stop the US ? Secondly , the specific example given ; that of Japan , is a nonsense . These same people who flung themselves in flying bombs , who refuesed to leave foxholes when starving - and would resort to cannibalism rather than surrender , he believes were worried about a few grannies carrying sawn-off shot-guns .
Actually this is something that this choicer has been well aware of . I have long had addressing poverty issues and domestic violence on my lists of ways that could reduce abortion . The bit about `` seeking out an abusive mate because they secretly feel they deserve it '' is a bit hard to swallow though . Usually an abuser reveals himself as such after the woman is in love , committed , etc . I do believe that there is a cycle to it , though . If abuse is what you know , what you grew up with , than you are more likely to have it in your adult life - but I do n't buy that women purposely seek it out .

`` I 'm convinced that we have to have federal legislation to build on . We 're going to have to take one step at a time , and the first step is necessarily  given the political realities  going to be very modest . Of course , it 's true that politicians will then go home and say , 'This is a great law . The problem is solved . ' And it 's also true that such statements will tend to defuse the gun-control issue for a time . So then we 'll have to strengthen that law , and then again to strengthen that law , and maybe again and again . Right now , though , we 'd be satisfied not with half a loaf but with a slice . Our ultimate goal  total control of handguns in the United States  is going to take time . My estimate is from seven to ten years . The problem is to slow down the increasing number of handguns sold in this country . The second problem is to get them all registered . And the final problem is to make the possession of all handguns and all handgun ammunition  except for the military , policemen , licensed security guards , licensed sporting clubs , and licensed gun collectors  totally illegal .

- Democrats are tokenizing gay rights groups . If the recent election and stance by John Kerry does not alarm gay rights activists , something is terribly wrong . In the end , there was very , very little difference in the stance between the two candidates regarding gay rights . The marriage amendment was the only difference , but to be fair , gay activists should say that Kerry saw them no more 'human ' than Bush . Unfortunately for gay people , they have been taken and cheated by the Democratic party . The most they have gotten is token words and occassional promises that never really take place . But in the debates , Kerry was just as unappoving of gay marriage as Bush was . So why would gay rights activists overwhelmingly support Kerry and the Democratic party ? Ca n't they see they have been sold a rotten bill of goods ? Democrats have been no more helpful in the last 20 years -- Clinton himself would not veto DOMA , signing it instead . It is difficult to take gay rights groups seriously when they throw their enthusiastic support at only Democrat canididates who are practically no different than Republican ones on the issue . Frankly , it smacks of partisanship and backroom politics . Gay people are the losers . Does that mean that gay people would be better off supporting Republicans ? Not necessarily . But at least a little less blind political allegiance would help . At this point , it would seem that even if the Republican party ran a gay candidate who supported gay marriage enthusiastically , gay rights groups would still endorse the Democrat . Yes , it 's THAT bad .
Fair enough . I 'm sorry for making such a newbie mistake . If there 's a way to delete this thread , I 'll be pursuing it . Thanks !

Anti-Abortion Hi , I 'm brand new to this forum but not to abortion debates . I have been active in abortion debates for almost 20 years now . ( not bragging , just providing some background ) I started `` online '' debating even before the internet was available to the general public . We used a direct dial BBS called `` FIDONET . '' ( look it up on Wikipedia ) I used to be `` pro-choice '' with regard to elective abortion . and the legality thereof . I was of the ( seemingly very common ) belief that many people express ; `` I would n't personally want my child aborted , .. but who am I to tell a woman what she can and can not do with her body ? '' Sound familiar ? Long story , short ? My views started changing in 1989 when an up and coming radio talk show host issued a challenge . He ( Rush Limbaugh ) said that he believed that `` a persons life ( rights ) begins at and by their conceptionm , , , and he wanted someone to prove to him that it can possibly begin any other way . '' ( I despised Rush Limbaugh ) That challenge began my education process on the many abortion aspects and issues ... and I have been actively involved ever since . I have already read through several of the threads ( including this one ) in this forum and I 'm looking forward to participating in this forums ... and possibly incorporating it into my website .

21st Century cause and effect is not something those desiring adhesion to 2000-year mythical belief systems are prepared to accept . As a current example displaying what will happen with outlawing abortion , I offer over-the-counter cough medicine used as a ingredient in cooking crystal meth , the ( US ) current street drug of choice . Sales of that simple ingredient were banned in my state by politicians claiming it would 'dry up ' meth production . No support whatsoever from LE due to the simple fact that cheap finished product from Canada and Mexico would simply flood the market , eliminating the need for local production , expand usage by increased availability and fill up our jails with the aftermath of crimes against property and people . Guess what ? That 's exactly what 's happening . Christian morality regarding abortion and drugs might be the predominate factor in many of our criminal statutes , but there 's certainly no doubt it 's a cost we can no longer afford on a social or financial basis .
I have to ask : have you actually read what you just quoted ? I know that must sound rude , but I ca n't for the life of me see the connection with the rest of the thread - or indeed any of the points you 're trying to make . Non-random ( or environmentally cued ) amounts of variation is not the same as directed variation . Nor is there any reason to believe that these genetically regulated 'responsive ' rates of mutation did not arise , originally , as a random mutation themselves . You 're clearly very excited about something , but I ca n't see what it is ; sorry !

Fact is grant money is n't going to embryonic stem cell research because it has n't yielded results favorable to the investment ... now scientism on the other hand has an agenda in supporting the pro-choice contingent they do n't care about objectivity , truth , right ... wrong ... evidence , fact , reason , common sense , clinical trials . All they care about is their agenda , abortion on demand . Thought I 'd poke a hole the glass of Kool-Aid you folks are guzzling here : Stem Cell Research - The Next Four Years Under Barack Obama | Science Blog Congressman Daniel Lipinski - ( July 30 , 2007 ) Adult Stem Cell Research Puts Patients First , Proponents Say
They said that biological evolution has a simple scientific definition , and they were right . That term is often shortened to simply 'evolution ' , especially by practicing scientists - just as the word 'grip ' is used without confusion on the set of a film , despite it having a different meaning to that employed in other fields . The fundamental problem was this : you wanted to argue your case based on vague popular or layman 's usages of the term .
So let me get this straight - you admit that you are wrong , and you want me to provide documentation to prove this admission correct ?
Look over the Heller ruling again . All nine judges agreed unanimously that the Second Amendment protected a right that was wholly individual in nature . The only disagreement was whether the right still applied today .

# 1 - How are we now able to observe evolution , when the evolution of the world supposely took billions of years ?

A few cherry picked facts about California do n't prove anything .
very true . logic exists whether people are there to grasps its concepts or not . where we disagree is at your assumption that god created logic . how can this be ? logic is not contingent on any intelligent entity , whether it be man or god , to exist . the logic of increasing a quantity by adding to it would remain whether god existed or not . you have yet to tie the existence of logic to god as its cause
That is an erroneous line of reasoning because it fails to take into account the myriad of other options open to a women after birth to remove the newborn from her care without any ill effects ( physically anyway ) . Killing in the instance of a newborn is not justified because of those other options open to her .
Actually , they are not very effective at all . Undoubtedly because a condom retains the bulk of the discharge of semen , the rate is cut down . To become infected with any disease , two things are relevant in terms of the offending , invasive agent . One is the presence of some of those viruses , or germs , itself . The other is the quantity of that agent entering the body . If there are only a few bugs , the average human will kill them off . If theres a very heavy dose , the chance for an infection succeeding is greater . Therefore , by cutting down on the volume of semen , a condom certainly reduces the chance for AIDS . But AIDS viruses do get through the condom .
We call that a strawman , here . You have much to learn . Let me explain . A militia is a group of armed , ordinary citizens who gather . There are all these `` militias '' running around screaming that they 're a militia , but if my town was attacked for some reason , the citizens could just get some guns and gather on main street ... to form a militia ! Now do you understand ? If so , I expect you to ignore me . If not , then you 're hopeless . I ca n't get much clearer than that .
Three people have been arrested in connection with last months deadly double homicide in Arivaca that left a nine-year-old and her father dead . One of the people arrested for the homicide is the National Executive Director of the Minuteman American Defense group ( M.A.D . ) , a group known for patrolling the border , and is dedicated to `` Defending America 's Borders '' according to their website - http : //minutemenamericandefense.org/ Jason Eugene Bush , 38 , Shawna Forde , 42 and Albert Robert Gaxiola , 43 , were all taken into custody and charged in connection with the murders of 29-year-old Raul Flores and 8-year-old Brisenia Flores . Both were killed during an alleged home invasion . According to authorities , Bush , Forde , and Gaxiola broke into the home of the Flores family just after midnight on May 30th . At the time , the mother , father and daughter were home . The invaders reportedly shot the three members of the Flores family , killing the father , Raul , and the daughter , Brisenia . The invaders then left the scene .

Sigma , In our previous dialogues you put forth a litany of negative health consequences of being pregnant . Would you agree that abstinence would be the best protection a woman has against these negative health risks ? Would you support abstinence to protect women 's health ?
Yet evolutionists tell us that evolution could never happen the same way twice .

There are lots of facts that support it . The anthropic principle , the sudden appearance of fossils with no evolutionary past , symbiotic relationships between plants and insects . The fact that dogs have dogs and cats have cats . You interpretation of the evidence is just that your interpretation .
Yes , any legal argument which relies exclusively on religious doctrine is indeed harboring on freedom of religion infringement . The same holds true for all civil rights which have had opposition from the `` religious-right

Instead of debating the facts , evolutionists will often resort to attacking the intelligence ( or lack of it ) in their opponent .
And as far as the devoices go in our traditional marriages , that is also a problem that should be addressed . Committment should be taken much more serious , but two wrongs does not make a right . We need to move forward and fix America 's families and their problems , not support something that will eventually erase its very existence .
People as a whole are largely biased , uninformed , and care only about the wellbeing of the majority , persecuting the minority any chance they get . Simply put , the will of the people is too often to benefit the majority and persecute the minority , and this can be seen everywhere throughout history . The will of the people often deserves to be not only ignored but put in a little can and crushed , for the voice of the people is not the voice of the people at all ; it is the voice of the majority .
One other point : Say that the laws of physics ( which are derived from mutual human experience ) are wrong but just appear to be right and that some omnipotent being can change them whenever he likes . If these apparent laws have remained the same for all of recorded human time , then why should we suspect that they may change at any moment ? It all comes down to probability - if things are not what we expect they are from Science , then that should have manifested itself by now .
I never recall thinking girls were icky , I acually remember having crushes on girls when i was 5/6 , now it was n't of a sexual nature , but I was attracted to them .

Third , the violinist illustration is not parallel to pregnancy because it equates a stranger/stranger relationship with a mother/child relationship . This is a key point and brings into focus the most dangerous presumption of the violinist illustration , also echoed in McDonagh 's thesis . Both presume it is unreasonable to expect a mother to have any obligations towards her own child .
So far the only proof of God 's existence by lucaspa is : `` trust me , I 'experienced ' God therefore God exists '' There is incrdible suffering and pain in this world , and I can not conceive a God who is the embodyment of goodnes , compassion , love etc , to turn a blind eye to all the suffering going on on Earth .

Radical/Fundamentalist : Islam Christanity Judaism Marc9000 has asserted that evolution is a atheist tool used against religion . Therefore all religions that accept evolution , including metaphorical/liberal Abrahamic beliefs and their followers are in fact atheists .

Do you agree with the logic of Marc9000 that all religions that are n't of the radical Abraham are n't religions and all of their followers are atheists ?
Secondly , I see you are falling into the usual O.P . of your ilk : when without an argument , attack the opponent on a simple spelling error ( especially when the one letter is right next to the one intended on the keyboard `` n '' is right next to `` b '' last time I checked ) .

It seems to me that the people who are opposed to the healthcare bill are those who opposed Obama in the first place . I 'm not convinced it 's going to make that much difference on its own .

One reptile has a type of third eye , but it is n't for sight nor is it permanent . It is used to absorb vitamin D from the Sun for the first 6 months of life in order to help it grow into a healthy adult . Then it is covered by scales . Tuatara Fact Sheet But the question persists as to why it seemingly devolved the need for that third eye if it originally had 3 working eyes ? I mean , it did n't simultaneously evolve a poison gland or some other form of defense to replace the need for it . Now let 's look at some insects which you will invariably mention as flaws in my argument . They too have extra eyes called ocelli , not working eyes mind you ; and neither do they aid in sight but the ocelli are simple structures and are believed they only detect light levels and movement . Now why would evolution not give vulnerable flying insects perfect vision when they have allegedly had literally hundreds of millions of years and many reasons to evolve it ? Are you aware that the visual acuity of insects is approximately 1 % of that of humans ? And we all know that humans do n't have the best eye sight in the animal kingdom . MICROSCOPY-UK / MICSCAPE - Insect insights . Insect eyes . Honeybee legs . What really distinguishes evolutionists from creationists is that creationists will ask the questions fear to ask since this fraudulent gospel has so many inconsistencies which ca n't be reasonably or rationally answered , they refuse to even consider them . Keep in mind that I have pointed out scientifically documented realities about what exists within the animal kingdom , but what I will get back from you are what ifs and maybes regarding these inconsistencies . Why is it that you never look at what is evolutionary dogma and ask why if random mutation happens based on environmental , social and predatory pressures , has n't it made more diverse selections where needed , as in a working third eye in the back of animals heads , rather than in all cases follow a proscribed formula which exists today , just as it existed in the oldest fossils ever collected ?

Defense of Marriage Act , or DOMA , is the short title of a federal law of the United States passed on September 21 , 1996 as Public Law No . 104-199 , 110 Stat . 2419 . Its provisions are codified at 1 U.S.C . § 7 and 28 U.S.C . § 1738C . The law has two effects : 1 . No state ( or other political subdivision within the United States ) needs to treat a relationship between persons of the same sex as a marriage , even if the relationship is considered a marriage in another state . 2 . The federal government defines marriage as a legal union exclusively between one man and one woman .
This fact makes me think that you are NOT here to learn , rather , you only wan na throw an argument that you think is like the top anti-creationist argument in the world , and you probably think that you already won the whole debate .
However , there is an extra argument , using the Bible . If animals can 'micro'evolve , then assumedly so can humans . However , God has created man 'in his own image ' . Given that the 'image ' of man has potentially changed drastically over time ( compare different breeds of dogs , or of horses ) , what is the 'true image ' of man ? It 's almost certainly very little like we are today ...
Many think third trimester is ok . The trimester thing does n't mean anything to me anyway ... it has no medicial backing ... .just means 3 periods of 3 months each .

The ones that bug be are `` anti-woman '' or something like that .

Oh , really , pregnancy is not expensive ? Have you gone through a pregnancy ? I talked with numerous friends who went through pregnancies , and the costs were astonishing - from the doctor visits , to the actual delivery which can cost well into the thousands ( tens of thousands if there are difficulties with the birth ) . Just the visit I made shortly before getting an abortion was expensive . As for adoption , there very well may be no cost in the actual procedure- but there certainly are numerous costs - both monetarily and physically- before it . If you think otherwise , you are sadly mistaken .

This is correct . However , these rights not found in the Constitution are able to be restricted . `` And , seeing how you agree that the right to abortion is not in the Constitution , then it follows that the right to abortion can be restricted . ''

And if you think about it , there is no way that plasticity  adaptivity  could have evolved like evolutionists say because common sense says that this feature is automatically hard-wired into the brain . To believe otherwise would be to believe that millions-year-old moths didnt have the same physical/mental capabilities as a present-day moths  even though they both have brains . I believe in order for an animal to not be adaptive it would have to be born without a brain .

Look , Im a Christian , and us Christians , we understand that things like miracles that defy the laws of physics are the truth . We will never question that , because we are 100 % certain that God meant what he wrote . Scientists arent certain about anything  all they have is a bunch of theories ! ( gravity ) Clearly , stuff like science and reason have no place in our lives in the 21st century  we must live by the words of a very , very , old religious book . So that when the earth is consumed in fire at Armageddon , well physically ascend to paradise . And when I pray , the creator himself , and his son , born of a blessed virgin , come , and they speak to me , and they tell me Im correct . So atheists , who exactly is the deluded one here ?

Initially the Australian Electoral Commission will write to all apparent non-voters requesting that they either provide a reason for their failure to vote or pay a $ 20 penalty . If , within 21 days , the apparent non-voter fails to reply , can not provide a valid and sufficient reason or declines to pay the penalty , then prosecution proceedings may be instigated .

For this to be a consistent pro-choice argument , and assuming this to be a rightful interpretation and application of the 14th amendment there would be necessary conclusions . Those who hold this as an absolute belief must extend the right of a womans right to choose the allocation of her bodily resources beyond pregnancy and into every instance of life . Therefore the pro-choice line of reasoning that says that a woman has the right to choose to abort because she does not wish do share her bodily resources can be extended to conclude also that a newborn infant can be aborted if a woman decides not to donate her bodily resource of nutrition and she has no access to formula ( no other factors involved ) .

In the discussion of abortion , the subject of sexual intercourse naturally occurs . There is debate about sex for procreative and non-procreative purposes , among other topics . I would propose that if you have never had sex , it really is impossible to make thoughtful comments along these lines and should be precluded from discussing sexual behavior in this forum .
Why do n't we just ASK women who 've had abotions ... that 's all the proof you need ! I have been reading stories of women who in their own words talked about their abortion experiences ... .even the ones who claim to be pro choice and still are after the abortion make statements of lingering feeling guilt and regret over having it done as well as nightmares about it . If it 's really no big deal , then why would they feel that way ?
I look at it and it makes perfect sense to me and if you really think about it does not need to be substantiated because all they are is just simple observations , ask anyone here they will tell you I am right .

Abortion is not currently a crime . However , because abortion takes the life of an innocent human being for the convenience of another , it is morally wrong - unless the mother 's life is at stake .
You really should be careful about posting nonsense like this . If your article has any validity , it would be grounds for disarming the police , since them having access to guns would make them more violent towards the people , and more likely to kill innocent bystanders .
No one can deny that after a human being is conceived it will develop into the very same being as those debating this issue .
Another lie commonly perpetuated by Creationist cranks is the fable of the Haeckel hoax . They allege that Haeckel 's theory that ontology recapitulates phylogeny was promoted even in modern biology text books by inclusion of Haeckel 's iconic , but wrong , diagram of embryological development . Thus they accuse biologists of deliberate fraud . They accuse them of doing what they do so often themselves . One of the Creationist icons is Jonathan Wells , who devotes a chapter of his mendacious book , Icons of Evolution , to the longevity of Haeckel diagram . Are his claims accurate ? Not very . Here 's what TalkOrigins has to say about what little is true about Wells 's claims : This quote is from : Wells and Haeckel 's Embryos The rest of this extensive commentary explains what is wrong with Wells 's claims . The author concludes : One can fault some biology text books for not clearly explaining the context of Haeckel 's diagram . It was neither accurate nor entirely objective . It was misleading . However , one can not fault them for perpetuating Haeckel 's theories themselves . They do n't . They present current data in support of evolution , data that no Creationist dare read for fear of losing their immortal souls . That does n't depend on Haeckel . So as ever , the Creationist motto : Per Ardua Ad Ignoratia . Forever .

Later in a statement Ridgway said that murdering young women was his `` career '' .
They do not differ in any significant way .
A . Guns save more lives than they take ; prevent more injuries than they inflict * Guns used 2.5 million times a year in self-defense . Law-abiding citizens use guns to defend themselves against criminals as many as 2.5 million times every year -- or about 6,850 times a day.1 This means that each year , firearms are used more than 80 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives.2 * Of the 2.5 million times citizens use their guns to defend themselves every year , the overwhelming majority merely brandish their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off their attackers . Less than 8 % of the time , a citizen will kill or wound his/her attacker.3 * As many as 200,000 women use a gun every year to defend themselves against sexual abuse.4 * Even anti-gun Clinton researchers concede that guns are used 1.5 million times annually for self-defense . According to the Clinton Justice Department , there are as many as 1.5 million cases of self-defense every year . The National Institute of Justice published this figure in 1997 as part of `` Guns in America '' -- a study which was authored by noted anti-gun criminologists Philip Cook and Jens Ludwig.5 * Armed citizens kill more crooks than do the police . Citizens shoot and kill at least twice as many criminals as police do every year ( 1,527 to 606 ) .6 And readers of Newsweek learned that `` only 2 percent of civilian shootings involved an innocent person mistakenly identified as a criminal . The 'error rate ' for the police , however , was 11 percent , more than five times as high . `` 7 * Handguns are the weapon of choice for self-defense . Citizens use handguns to protect themselves over 1.9 million times a year.8 Many of these self-defense handguns could be labeled as `` Saturday Night Specials . '' B . Concealed carry laws help reduce crime * Nationwide : one-half million self-defense uses . Every year , as many as one-half million citizens defend themselves with a firearm away from home.9 * Concealed carry laws are dropping crime rates across the country . A comprehensive national study determined in 1996 that violent crime fell after states made it legal to carry concealed firearms . The results of the study showed : * States which passed concealed carry laws reduced their murder rate by 8.5 % , rapes by 5 % , aggravated assaults by 7 % and robbery by 3 % ; 10 and * If those states not having concealed carry laws had adopted such laws in 1992 , then approximately 1,570 murders , 4,177 rapes , 60,000 aggravated assaults and over 11,000 robberies would have been avoided yearly.11 * Vermont : one of the safest five states in the country . In Vermont , citizens can carry a firearm without getting permission ... without paying a fee ... or without going through any kind of government-imposed waiting period . And yet for ten years in a row , Vermont has remained one of the top-five , safest states in the union -- having three times received the `` Safest State Award . `` 12 * Florida : concealed carry helps slash the murder rates in the state . In the fifteen years following the passage of Florida 's concealed carry law in 1987 , over 800,000 permits to carry firearms were issued to people in the state.13 FBI reports show that the homicide rate in Florida , which in 1987 was much higher than the national average , fell 52 % during that 15-year period -- thus putting the Florida rate below the national average . 14 * Do firearms carry laws result in chaos ? No . Consider the case of Florida . A citizen in the Sunshine State is far more likely to be attacked by an alligator than to be assaulted by a concealed carry holder . 1 . During the first fifteen years that the Florida law was in effect , alligator attacks outpaced the number of crimes committed by carry holders by a 229 to 155 margin . 2 . And even the 155 `` crimes '' committed by concealed carry permit holders are somewhat misleading as most of these infractions resulted from Floridians who accidentally carried their firearms into restricted areas , such as an airport.15 C. Criminals avoid armed citizens * Kennesaw , GA . In 1982 , this suburb of Atlanta passed a law requiring heads of households to keep at least one firearm in the house . The residential burglary rate subsequently dropped 89 % in Kennesaw , compared to the modest 10.4 % drop in Georgia as a whole.16 * Ten years later ( 1991 ) , the residential burglary rate in Kennesaw was still 72 % lower than it had been in 1981 , before the law was passed.17 * Nationwide . Statistical comparisons with other countries show that burglars in the United States are far less apt to enter an occupied home than their foreign counterparts who live in countries where fewer civilians own firearms . Consider the following rates showing how often a homeowner is present when a burglar strikes : * Homeowner occupancy rate in the gun control countries of Great Britain , Canada and Netherlands : 45 % ( average of the three countries ) ; and , * Homeowner occupancy rate in the United States : 12.7 % .18 Rapes averted when women carry or use firearms for protection * Orlando , FL . In 1966-67 , the media highly publicized a safety course which taught Orlando women how to use guns . The result : Orlando 's rape rate dropped 88 % in 1967 , whereas the rape rate remained constant in the rest of Florida and the nation.19 * Nationwide . In 1979 , the Carter Justice Department found that of more than 32,000 attempted rapes , 32 % were actually committed . But when a woman was armed with a gun or knife , only 3 % of the attempted rapes were actually successful.20 Justice Department study : * 3/5 of felons polled agreed that `` a criminal is not going to mess around with a victim he knows is armed with a gun . `` 21 * 74 % of felons polled agreed that `` one reason burglars avoid houses when people are at home is that they fear being shot during the crime . `` 22 * 57 % of felons polled agreed that `` criminals are more worried about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police . `` 23 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 1 Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz , `` Armed Resistance to Crime : The Prevalence and Nature of Self-Defense With a Gun , '' 86 The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology , Northwestern University School of Law , 1 ( Fall 1995 ) :164 . Dr. Kleck is a professor in the school of criminology and criminal justice at Florida State University in Tallahassee . He has researched extensively and published several essays on the gun control issue . His book , Point Blank : Guns and Violence in America , has become a widely cited source in the gun control debate . In fact , this book earned Dr. Kleck the prestigious American Society of Criminology Michael J. Hindelang award for 1993 . This award is given for the book published in the past two to three years that makes the most outstanding contribution to criminology . Even those who do n't like the conclusions Dr. Kleck reaches , can not argue with his impeccable research and methodology . In `` A Tribute to a View I Have Opposed , '' Marvin E. Wolfgang writes that , `` What troubles me is the article by Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz . The reason I am troubled is that they have provided an almost clear-cut case of methodologically sound research in support of something I have theoretically opposed for years , namely , the use of a gun in defense against a criminal perpetrator ... . I have to admit my admiration for the care and caution expressed in this article and this research . Can it be true that about two million instances occur each year in which a gun was used as a defensive measure against crime ? It is hard to believe . Yet , it is hard to challenge the data collected . We do not have contrary evidence . '' Wolfgang , `` A Tribute to a View I Have Opposed , '' The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology , at 188 . Wolfgang says there is no `` contrary evidence . '' Indeed , there are more than a dozen national polls -- one of which was conducted by The Los Angeles Times -- that have found figures comparable to the Kleck-Gertz study . Even the Clinton Justice Department ( through the National Institute of Justice ) found there were as many as 1.5 million defensive users of firearms every year . See National Institute of Justice , `` Guns in America : National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms , '' Research in Brief ( May 1997 ) . As for Dr. Kleck , readers of his materials may be interested to know that he is a member of the ACLU , Amnesty International USA , and Common Cause . He is not and has never been a member of or contributor to any advocacy group on either side of the gun control debate . 2 According to the National Safety Council , the total number of gun deaths ( by accidents , suicides and homicides ) account for less than 30,000 deaths per year . See Injury Facts , published yearly by the National Safety Council , Itasca , Illinois . 3Kleck and Gertz , `` Armed Resistance to Crime , '' at 173 , 185 . 4Kleck and Gertz , `` Armed Resistance to Crime , '' at 185 . 5 Philip J. Cook and Jens Ludwig , `` Guns in America : National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms , '' NIJ Research in Brief ( May 1997 ) ; available at http : //www.ncjrs.org/txtfiles/165476.txt on the internet . The finding of 1.5 million yearly self-defense cases did not sit well with the anti-gun bias of the study 's authors , who attempted to explain why there could not possibly be one and a half million cases of self-defense every year . Nevertheless , the 1.5 million figure is consistent with a mountain of independent surveys showing similar figures . The sponsors of these studies -- nearly a dozen -- are quite varied , and include anti-gun organizations , news media organizations , governments and commercial polling firms .

Like evolution , right ? You have your conclusion , so everything else must adhere to it . Just answer the question . How to you account for the statements above ?
trebor : Katrine is being particularly unkind to Alabama .
What about due process ?
No , there really are n't . As for Robertson , why do you think I said he was right ( as in global warming is happening and we are largely responsible ) by sheer luck ?
Oh yeah , like the televangelist shows . Come on , get real .
I still do not understand what these people are demonstrating for or against . Are they demonstarting for being dropped in the middle of cancer treatement ? Are they demonstrating for being denied coverage due to pre-existing condition ? Are they demonstrating for increasing healthcare costs ? Are they demonstrating for keeping 50 million people uninsured ?
* Polystrate fossils ( ones which traverse many strata ) speak of very quick deposition of the strata .
Archangel fails to understand the basis of Animism ( as usual ) . Animism seeks to explain things it can not by assigning them supernatural associations . Often that is done through a soul . The principle argument I 've argued in their similarities is that of why they do such a thing . What can not be explained now or its relation to the greater whole is credited to a supernatural being , a being or set of beings that exists not entirely of the natural world . Where ancient animists believed that lightning was associated with the Gods , and that Volcanoes were the manifestation of Pele , the principle is the same . What can not be explained or understood now is of a higher being . How did this rock get here ? Where did deer come from ? How do they exist in the larger picture ? Animists assign souls , or anima to the inanimate and animate objects as a way to place what they do not understand into a coherent organized picture . Intelligent design is no different . Only that it has replaced lightning , volcanoes and rain with the human eye and origin of the life . While it may not use the same identical concepts of anima to inanimate object , the core logic is identical . What is too complex to understand or explain now is of a higher being .
That 's why the bible say 's that the wisdom of this World is foolishness to God .
Yeah , I kind of get tired of hearing humbug from feminists like yourself too . Woman have already been liberated ( well , definitely in the West ) , have you not noticed ? Why do you have to sterio-type men ? Just because you 've grown up with aragant arse-wipes , does n't mean that the whole male population are like that ... it 's almost like me saying that ALL woman are scared of spiders . Ps , you need to stop acting like an angry reincarnated suffragette and get that dildo out your arse . Live life , you may enjoy it ... as apposed to being bitter about what our male ancestors did .
In other words , the health of our nation 's women is not a national concern .
Link me to one saying weed 'addiction ' is worse than alcoholism please .
Would depend on how sucessful they thought the handing in was , but do n't you have to register for a leicence ? So all legal owners are know already and can be checked off against the guns they have handed in , I would imagine that there must be departments of the police who deal with tracking black market unregisted guns so these could be cracked down opon . In addition you would have to make possesion of a firearm illegal , then you have to balance defending your property with revealing you are commiting a crime ( will be fairly obvious if you use one and you would have to get rid of it anyway when forensics investigate the crime scene ) . Would also have to look at countries that have carried out sucessful ones to see if there are any little points or mistakes to pick up . If there is a lot of resistance you could make possesion of a gun attempted murder , would make people think very carefully whether they would want to carry them , especailly criminals- comunity service or light sentace for a mugging or long term prison sentance for attempted murder if they are carrying a gun while doing it , even in bank robbery they would likely think twice about the additional years .
WHAT ? I do n't see anything regarding that . Seriously , what are you talking about ?
Any similarity to the Natural History Museum in London is imaginary .
So you see , it is much harder to believe in a fossil record and sediment deposit stratigraphy , than in a giant boat crammed to the gills full of elephants , octopus , and cacti . I hope I cleared this up for everyone . We have found fossils , but they are all fake . We have not found an ark .but it is real .
Over 10,000 signatures of Christian Clergy have been collected , and have endorsed this letter .
The Bible . The bible was created for control , without the bible , without the promise of being rewarded for your kindness and brotherhood on earth , humans would have no reason to surpress their natural tendencies .
Good list and it shows why a lot of people defending guns come off as being nutty extremists .
I realize this . But I have n't heard of breaking research in areas like growing crops in deserts , or re-purifying urine . I would think that if the world is truly as over-populated as you make it out to be , we would be desperate for technologies like these .
There is no evidence for a distant shell of cometary material surrounding the solar system , and there is no known way to add comets to the solar system at rates that even remotely balance their destruction .
Hey Penfold , I have to agree with Issly , because it has already been done here . It happened in New Orleans during catrina , the only difference is what Happened in New Orleans never went nationwide as it will if Obama is elected . The NRA called Obama up and invited him to go on a bear hunt , Obama agreed to go but said he wanted nothing to do with a gun though , Obama said he would only be an observer of the bear being hunted . The NRA then asked Obama if he went unarmed and found himself face to face with an angry bear how he would handle the situation , Obama replied '' I will enter into direct peace negotiations with the bear , if that fails I will place sanctions on him . People who support obama are like sheep being led to slaughter . You better wake up and do the background research on Obama before you make the biggest mistake of your life by voting for that XXXXX . You can view the New Orleans gun confiscation video on you tube or the NRA web-site either one .
What are you thoughts ? Is this just some pro-life nut that does n't know what she is talking about ?
Former Supreme Court chief justice Warren Burger complained about the NRA having too much influence in government and misleading the American people :
Did they finish up the feeder ?
Indeed . But the creationists claim that is has 'true science ' on its side . I wonder why the resident creationists have not graced us with a brief summary of their science ?
True , but it does make evolution a known factor , and the scientific method requires that one prioritise exhausting the explicative power of known factors before inventing new ones .
Oh good grief ! I have always lived in rough areas . In one city , Alburquerque , a drug deal went sour 10 feet fom where I slept , and a guy had his head blasted away by a shotgun . Where I worked , less than a block away , a gunner massacred everyone in a video rental place . I was even obliged to ferry a guy with a slash on his throat to an ER , I did n't know the stupid beast , I was scared to death , but I felt it my Christian duty ( even though I am not a Christian ) to get the guy to where he could get treatment . And I do n't own a damned gun because I am not chicken-hearted .
Once one is adept at finding evidence after a conclusion is presumed , all sorts of `` proofs '' reveal themselves . What 's next , Nostradamus ?
But one idea that makes me hesistate to be pro-choice is an analogy . Imagine a hunter who sees something moving behind a bush . It could be a deer , it could be a human , or it could be something else . The hunter lacks the information to know for sure what is behind the bush . What is the ethical policy for a hunter in this situation ? It seems clear to me : if you are not sure it 's not human , do n't kill it .
Are not all people conceived in this country deserving of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness ?
Teaching students to be responsible ! What a crime !
Y'know , if a pro-choice person had posted a similar item from a pro-choice website , you would have dismissed it out of hand .

If morality is relative and not absolute then nobody can say Hitler was wrong for the things he did .
His method appears to be good , i.e . using observations and experimental data , as well as repeatability .
OccamsRazor : How would you answer the arguement put forth by Red Queen theory- that sexual life has to continually reproduce just to keep pace with other life hostile to it ? If one organism were to stop reproducing and exist in status quo it will sooner or later fall victim to the ever evolving parasites that target it or organisms competing for its ecological niche . As it has stopped running the evolutionary arms race it is forever stuck with the characteristics it was born which would rapidly reach obsolescence ( on the scale of reproductive generations ) .
Do you really think the paper tape is really the fundamental reason why violence is not an issue in Switzerland ?
`` ( 14 . ) When gun controllers cite incidents such as the Columbine shooting as proof that more gun control is needed , they are just 'appealing to emotion ' instead of logic . But when pro-gunners say that Columbine could have been prevented if teachers were allowed to carry guns , they are making a logical , sound argument .
I do n't see how you logically derive this conclusion from what I said . Can you elaborate ?
I 'm not using the term `` atheism '' in a derogatory manner . It 's an assertion that there is no God . But today it 's every bit as organized and politically active as any religion - it has happened practically overnight , thanks to modern communications . It now has the same ability to impose itself on society exactly like religion , and is covered by the first amendment the same as any religion . It can not claim science as its god , and force it upon public education .
I do not understand why the same people who claim that the government is incopetent and inefficient are afraid that the public option will outcompete the insurance copanies and put them out of business .

It 's been a long standing standard that if the only motivation for a law , act , etc is religious , then it 's a violation of SOCAS . If a proposed law just happens to agree with your religion , or if religion is just one small part of the motivation , then it 's not a problem . But if you take out religion and you 're left with pretty much nothing , then you 've got an issue .
Oh , it certainly is an issue . Martin Killias , a Swiss criminologist , did find a link between gun ownership and homicide in Switzerland . However , my point was to ask you if you would be willing to abide by such regulations . The law in Switzerland requires that military weapons kept in the home be unloaded and stored under lock and key . I do n't think Switzerland is a gun-nut utopia .
What about them ? Is this a question ?
They excuse aborting a fetus of a feckless mother by citing the angst of the expectant mother that concieved through rape .
So lets just say I have a mythical Friend who is an agent at the FBI . And he calls me last week asking for info . To make short work of this conversation . He asks ,  am I familiar with eco-terrorist and Peta terrorism ?  I said I was . He then says , that there have been reports of Anti-gunners and other far left people who are very unhappy with the Obama Administrations seeming capitulation to standard practices , and they were threatening some kind of action . He says , I know you are active on debating forums , and he asks me , do I think the Anti-gunners are capable of terrorism ? I told him that I really did not think it to be a credible threat from my experiences , and I thought that the Anti-gunner part was bogus . Antis ! Please ! Dont let me be wrong ! Please ! Let cooler heads prevail !
Furthermore , law abiding citizens can sell their guns to criminals in private transactions . In these transactions , the purchaser is not required to pass a background check so how can the seller be sure whether or not the buyer has a criminal history ?
If you 're willing to accept this , does n't that in a way contradict the gun control theory of `` well regulated militia ? '' In other words the founders knew the importance of the citizenry militia against encroachments of the goverment , but then gave the government the power to make the encroachments easier by disarming the citizenry ?

Bias in action .
3 ) Pat has a condition called `` chimerism '' which is the result of two zygotes becoming fused during development in the womb - somewhat like siamese twins , but the two sets of genetically-distinct cell populations in the body are highly integrated . In Pat 's case each zygote was of a different sex and as a result , Pat is not only made-up of two genetically distinct people , but one of them is male and the other female . Pat 's brain is composed of the female cell line and decides to undergo medical treatment that would remove the male genitalia from the male person in Pat 's body and replace those areas with female physical features . Should the government step-in to prevent this operation in order to protect the male person that is part of , but distict from Pat ?

How can what did not erode for 100 million years to expose a full dino print , now be eroding only within the last 40 ?
I dont care how many frauds you can copy paste and quote .
How would I fill in some of the gaps ? Here was my sequence : something like unicellular life to multi-cellular life , random multi-cellular conglomerations to an amoeba , to a fish , to a dinosaur , to a mammal , to an ape , and finally to a man ? ?
Since the time when it became widely available ( 1960s I would guess ) , have abortions decreased ?
It does n't matter whether it is religous or not . The odds of anyboy being fired over such a thing are slim to none . Morning after pills can not possibly make up eough of any given pharmacys revenue to make it worth the expense of replacing a skilled employee .
And how do you KNOW this creature is that old ?
They also believe somehow that until a child breathes its first breathe , it ca n't be called or considered a PERSON .
In the many years that have supported abortion rights I have never found a single pro-lifer who could prove , outside their opinion and others , how a fetus has an interest in being born . Unfortunately for them , fetuses have never elected pro-lifers to speak their behalf of but instead vice-versa . The pro-life movement plays as a self-appointed representative towards fetuses despite a lack of evidence or substance as to why a fetus , at the moment of conception , has an interest in living .
You still fail to address the fact of liberal firearm owners . Or is the fact of owning a firearm enough to have one drummed out of the liberal camp , buttons ripped off and sword broken ?
I researched this on a source that did not have `` gay '' in the URL . Shcokingly , I found a different story as told by the decidely non-right-of-center Portland Tribune :
I actually have n't seen those pictures in school but I 'll take your claim that most kids have as true . No one says that Apes turned into men , but they did say that man and apes share a common ancestor . That is established scientific theory . Again , abiogenesis is not a scientific theory , so there is n't a comparison to that and making ID a scientific theory . The common ancestor has been virtually proven by the fossil record . How is that not science ? Please explain in more detail .
You throw personal insults more than I do . So when will YOU grow up ?
I wonder how far you can take this . For instance , you may never allow `` the people of the country '' to tell you what 's best for your health , but we need only look at an example to prove that `` the people of the country '' can make a law in that arena anyway . Marijuana , for example . You may not think marijuana is harmful to your health , but if you smoke it , you break the law . And if you break the law , you can be punished under that law . Even if you do n't think the `` people of the country '' can tell you what is best for your life or your health , they still legitimately do so in many areas .
The point is Kopel and Lott are liars as previously demonstrated regarding the Carpenter family 's tragedy . Please do n't waste my time with these biased , dishonest gun advocates any further .
Do we really need to charge someone being tried for armed robbery or worse with an additional petty weapons charge ?

1 ) Where and how was the mind created ? How can the ability to think and reason be created by purely physical material ? What was the mutation that caused brain cells to become something more than the sum of their parts ?
What I 've been saying here , and after awhile - the guilt , depression , etc - will get buried , deeper & amp ; deeper - but no negative/damaging experiences leave people . They stay quietly in the background-computer base - until , as you said : Hopefully , the person `` finds some way of forgiving themselves '' , right . But what about in the mean-time ? - And we know , from research & amp ; quite a number of Healers , that rot ( inside a person ) is damaging ... and often in very unsuspecting ways . Much better to life benevolently , in the first place . Annie
In the latter case , that 's because more fornicators are shacking up rather than getting married , which is why there 's fewer divorces . If a state allows gay marriages their spirituality is in the toilet . Gay sex sin is a perversion and an abomination according to the Bible .
`` What I find most interesting '' is to consider a humanity purged of the chronic scourge of rabid religion . How much more pleasant , and saner would the world be . And how many Indigenous peoples around the planet would have continued to survive and thrive unmolested by what i consider the evilest of all manmade plagues , religion .
As I said before , I cant come up with anything persuasive and new for ID . Everything on it has been steamrolled by lots of evolutionists in publicly funded institutions . But it is legitimate to hold other branches of science to the same standard as ID is held to .
By the way , everyone in the world believes in a God .
When the citizens are allowed to vote for a ban on same-sex marriage , and it passes alarmingly , in some instances by a 70 % margin , how can people fight to try and get it repealed ? All of the 11 initiatives passed by at least 10 % , and I think 8 of them also banned civil unions . With this alarming margin of appeal , why are gays still trying to fight this ? Some times you ca n't have everything the way you want it . What 's next ... do we try and have the results of the election reversed because some people did n't like the outcome ? Stop whining and move somewhere where it 's legal to get married to another guy and stop trying to impose your way of life on people everywhere .
I am NOT going to spend the next 3 months of my life teaching you basic biology so I can get you to the point where you would understand how many errors and bone headed questions you asked in your OP .
Yes I am sure . Long fur will insulate the dog a lot better than medium fur will . You do not have to be a scientist to figure that one out .
This standard gets ever complicated . The 22wk old baby inside the mother has `` less value '' to you it seems . Actual location determines a value ... someone else determines the value on someone . It really is confusing . I just do n't understand how value it relative to other things ... .even more so when it comes to humans

A taste of what could be our future if the left has its way .
aswell as the socialogical aspects of how conveniant religion is huh ? if your nice and stay orderly youll exist for eternity in heaven ( wow that sounds like a pretty sweet deal )
There is a point , however , that the fetal lung is not mature enough to survive outside the womb even with mechanical assistance . So , unless our technology will be pretty radically different in the future , it is n't about getting it out , it 's about it not surviving when it is out .
Let me pose a hypothetical question . Same scenario as yours above but instead there is a genetically normal zygote on one table or on the other table , there is a mentally retarded newborn baby ... which one will you choose if you had 2 seconds to choose ?
How did a lizard evolve an avian lung ?
Israel has now aborted more babies than jews that were killed in the holocaust ... Abortion was nazi germany 's favorite way to try to exterminate the jews . The lady who started planned parenthood wanted to iniliate the `` poor race '' . isnt that just sick ? ? lets get some perspective on what this really is ...
What the Bible says sure as well better be irrelevant in the writing of our laws . Our government was designed to be separate from religion to protect all who would worship . Our laws need solid secular reasoning or we become a theocratic state .
The Same-Sex Marraige amendments appear to have passed in at least three states ... in Georgia and Kentucky by a 3-to-1 margin and in Mississippi by 6-to-1 . The Georgia amendment is likely to be challenged because of its wording . However , same-sex marriage is already illegal in Georgia so we really should n't need an amendment .
Hi Rogue , This is simply false . Rock can be folded under pressure . This has been proven by lab experiment . However there are many features in sedimentary rocks that can not be formed quickly , for example , fossil trackways . This is false . http : //www.talkorigins.org/faqs/polystrate/trees.html I 'm not sure what you 're talking about here . Go on . There are flood stories carried by many cultures , however they do n't match in the details with noah flood myth . Not one mentions noah by name . Reference please . The Grand canyon could not have been created by a flood event , the geology is all wrong : http : //www.talkorigins.org/faqs/icr-science.html The flood explains nothing which can not be explained by other , better-supported means and directly contradicts vast swathes of evidence : Biodivesity and the fossil record are not consistent with the flood . Genetic profiling is not consistent with the flood ( in humans and animals ) The Ark could not hold all animal life . A global mark would have left marks across the entire globe at a consistent time period ; these marks are not found .
** A couple of quick poiints . First , you are very emotionally involved in the materialist/mechanist metaphysic , whether you grasp the full implications of that metaphysic , [ beyond its denial of certain religious mythologies ] , or not . Otherwise you would not so vehemently and tenaciously defend that metaphysic against any suggerstionthatits take on reality , its ontology/cosmoly , is incorrect -- even when , as in the case of EAM , that t most certainly is not . Nor is the accompanying assumption , i.e. , that anysuggestion comes from a metaphysical quarter that has no ideological connection to any religious mythology , and in fact is also antithetical to those myths .
The figures I have seen is that there have been 40 million abortions ( or as I call it murder of the innocent unborn ) since Rowe V Wade was enacted in 1972 ... ... ..
Once again , this shows the true colors of liberals . Oh they 'll scream `` tolerance '' and `` acceptance '' when it relates to them or their causes . But whenever conservatives speak up , to quote Rush : `` Racist , Sexist , Bigot , Homophobe '' are the standard fare that is heard .
I do have some interest in the topic of viability though , so if you could perhaps explain what you are saying , I would be interested in discussing the topic with you .
Abortion is n't a legal crime . How ever , in all other ways , it certainly is a crime . I think the moderator should move this to abortion discussion .
this is the omega word
Then explain to me why a pregnant woman was hit by a car not long ago leading to the death of both mother and baby . Resulting in a double vehicular homicide charge being leveled against the driver ? How can that be if the unborn child does n't have rights as a human being ? And why could the mother have aborted that baby legally if she chose to ? Is n't that a true catch 22 for the unborn , and a contradiction in the law ?
I do ask you to question the belief because of the makeup of the female in Gods scheme of things and undue burden legislation would put on a woman . I think that Alan Simpson , Conservative Republican of Wyoming said it best when he said , Not only shouldnt men have a vote on the issue , they should keep their mouths shut.
If all life evolved from a common ancestor , then there should be countless instances of new body parts evolving . Body parts such as eyes , muscle , bone , etc . We have not seen one instance of a new body part evolving in a population in which it has not existed previously . Evolutionists will wave the magic `` time wand '' and simply claim that such a change could never be observed in a few decades . What about fruit flies ? One generation of fruit flies = around a day . Fruit flies were exposed to x rays to speed up mutation rates , we have observed the equivalent of millions of years ( in terms of human generations ) of super-accelerated mutation and ... . no new body parts . Evolutionists will also list in steps how a new body part can arise . This is only plausible if each of those steps could be directly observed . If not , then it is nothing more than science fiction . Evolutionists have been searching for any direct evidence of the theory of evolution since the 1800 's . They are still looking .

I do , indeed , know who planned parenthood is . That does n't necessarily make them accurate - and if you look for long enough on the internet , you can find a source which says pretty much whatever you want it to .
I wo n't throw my ideas on abortion out there just yet , but I have to ask this question . Should fathers have to pay child support considering a mother could have mitigated the expense by having an abortion ? For example : Jack is 55 and makes 20,000 a year . Jack gets injured by Bob , and can no longer work unless he gets a $ 1000 operation . Jack 's religion or other views preclude getting the operation , so he sues Bob for $ 200,000 , the wages he 'll lose over the next ten years . Since Jack could mitigate his losses by having the operation , nost likely all he will be entitled to is $ 1000 . So- should n't child support be limited to the cost of an abortion , under our current pro-abortion laws ?

For example , it 's widely accepted that Judaism did not arise in a cultural vacuum , but that the ancient Hebrews borrowed theology and mythology from the Canaanites , Babylonians , and Persians .
It is when you rely on them to determine what is to be right and wrong in other people 's lives . Since you are heterosexual and have rallied against gay rights/gay marriage you have done this and are therefore imposing your religion on others .
Y'know the thing about everyone thinking the world was flat before Columbus is a myth , right ?
Unfortunately , Dembski and his `` explanatory '' filter are more hot air than substance . He has claiming to have 'discovered ' desing in nature by using the 'filter ' , but for some strange reason , he has yet to publish his amazing discovery . he said he was going to do it in `` Mere Creation '' , then he said it would be iun `` No Free Lunch '' - so tell us , IS IT actually in his newest collection of apocryphal tall tales , or is is just assumed that he has done so ? Common tactic - keep claiming that you will do something , then claim to have already done it later on , without , of course , actually doing it . The only times Dembski has acxtually applied it , he did it to things1 . we know were the product of design and 2. never did it on anything biological . It is all fluff and hot air .
I do n't doubt you do . To do otherwise would be to admit you 're wrong , which you choose not to do , because it would reduce your beliefs to the irrational . However , you are both wrong , and the belief is irrational .

Gun sales are booming nationwide  and in Erie County , applications for pistol permits are rolling in at nearly three times last years rate , the county clerks office reports . Meanwhile , in the nations capital , gun control has become , in essence , dead on arrival . Chalk it all up to the election of a Democratic president with a long record of supporting gun restrictions and a Congress that includes a surprising number of pro-gun Democrats from rural areas . The election of Barack Obama as president is sparking a run on firearms and ammunition in both Buffalo and nationwide , according to gun dealers and experts on the issue .

In my veiw , no law can make any country crime free . The only way to make a country crime free is to get rid of laws , which would just be ridiculous . If somebody wants to do something bad enough , no law can stop them from doing it . As long as there are laws , there will be crime .

You wo n't achieve anything trying to attack straight marriage -- as an institution , the only ones who can undermine it are straight people who choose not to marry . I guess I just ca n't see the point of this particular thread .

Now we subject students to higher math studies that they will most likely never use and speculations about conceptual mechanisms like natural selection that have no practical application .
So easy to do in America , a nation which refuses to acknowledge the need for responsible gun ownership .

In the last three months of 2008 , that 's right , three months , Americans bought enough guns to outfit the Chinese and Indian armies , combined . Actually , that 's just reflective of the NICS checks , which do n't cover sales by private parties , and buys by CCW permit holders . There were also 1.5 BILLION rounds of ammo sold , which explains why I 'm having trouble finding .45 ACP lately .
Yep , it certainly cann be quite expensive .
That 's a completely different argument , order does not imply a creator .
Again , you speak as if gays and lesbians are not worthy of their relationships being sacred to them . As if gays and lesbians are unable to hold dear any concept of commitment , loyalty , partnership .

So what about the soft tissue ? Well , Humber makes a very common creationist mistake by asserting that Dinosaur tissue has been extracted from bone fossils and has been found to be both soft and flexible ,  which shows that he did not read Schweitzers 2005 paper on her findings . Theres really no excuse ; its available for free through the website of the journal Science , and the second sentence of the materials & amp ; methods section explains that Schweitzer did not stick in her thumb , pull out some Tyrannosaurus soft tissue , and say Gee what a good girl am I ( and yes , I am aware that Schweitzer began this study under the guidance of paleontologist John Jack Horner ) . The opening of the supplement reads ; Small ( 0.05-2 inches width ) fragments of untreated compact and undescribed ( 1S ) endosteally derived bone tissues were separated from Tyrannosaurus rex ( MOR 1125 ) femur and collected under a hood , using aseptic methods . Tissues were demineralized ( 0.5M EDTA , pH 8.0 ) for 7 days , changing buffer daily . Material remaining after demineralization was rinsed with phosphate buffer ( PBS , pH 6.8 ) and imaged using a Zeiss dissecting scope with a digital camera and Axio Vision Software ( other dinosaur specimens were demineralized according to this protocol but no further analyses were undertaken for this study ) . Rather than putting her hand in a pile of goo , Schweitzer separated the tissues and tried to remove as much mineral material as possible , leaving only the organic material behind . Indeed , this dinosaur ( like many ) was still in the process of fossilization when extracted from the ground , and there was significant enough mineral material around the tissues for Schweitzer to spend time dissolving them .
We can only conceive of god in very rudimentary primitive concepts because of our immature and very limited intellect .
Also , I noticed you have n't posted on the theistic evolution thread . Why do n't you defend your claims that evolution is atheistic and/or that it is only for destroying religious views .
The only stumbling block between science and faith is a strictly literal interpretation . For most of us Faith and science work together !
At most it will lead to another Timothy McVeigh type incident .
It is a place to teach kids how to think and the different ideas we have now . ID simply deals with the `` fact '' that there was an intelligent designer . It does n't benefit science in any possible way , as there is really nothing you can conclude from ID .
Now read it again and do n't make a conclusion before you finish this time . He states genetics as a cause twice both times he is quoting a source . The first is the subject of the article the second is a poll . As part of the poll he states conservatives do n't accept the liberal opinion for genetics but believe the choice theory which has been discredited . Scientist may not know without a doubt what causes someone to be gay , but they know without a doubt it is not a choice .

and redundant terms ? I 'm not seeing it there .
What you really mean is - Creationists do n't answer the way you 'd like them to . The fact is they usually get bored with presenting good evidence , only to have die hard evolutionists refuse to acknowledge the good science behind their claims . That 's what seperates evolutionists from real scientists .
The Bible is a book . It is a guide to our behavior and to God . It is not a history or science text , nor is meant to be . What a waste of time to try and use the Bible to refute science !
And FYI , `` marriage '' was around long before the Bible .
This error becomes immediately evident if we amend Thompson 's illustration . What if the mother woke up from an accident to find herself surgically connected to her own child ? What kind of mother would willingly cut the life-support system to her two-year-old in a situation like that ? And what would we think of her if she did ?

Atheism is a curse !
Both Presidents were shot in the back of the head , on the Friday before a major holiday , while seated beside their wives , neither of whom were injured . Both were in the presence of another couple , and in each case that man was also wounded by the assassin . After both assassinations there were loud and insistent claims that the fatal shot must have come from a different direction . Each President in his thirties married a socailly prominent twenty-four year old girl who spoke French fluently . While in the White House , each President had a family of three children , and both lost a child through death . Both Lincoln and Kennedy were second children . Both had been boat captains . Both were related to a U.S . Senator , Attorney General , ambassador to Great Britain , and the mayor of Boston . Each had been elected to Congress in the year '47 and were vice-presidential runners-up in the year '56 . Each was elected president in '60 . Before each was elected , a sister died . Both had a friend named Billy Graham and knew an Adlai Stevenson . President Kennedy had a secretary named Mrs. Lincoln and President Lincoln had a secretary named John Kennedy . The names Lincoln and Kennedy each contain seven letters . Both were succeeded by vice-presidents named Johnson : Andrew born in 1808 and Lyndon in 1908 , both of whom had 13 letters in their names and two daughters . Both assassins have fifteen letters in their names . Booth shot Lincoln in a theatre and fled to a warehouse . Oswald shot Kennedy from a warehouse and fled to a theatre . Both assassins were in their turn assassinated by shooters who used a Colt revolver and fired only one , fatal shot .
Global warming is nothing more than a myth that was cooked up by nature freaks who 're against anything industrialized . And if that is n't true , then I do n't care ; we 've already done far too much damage for any difference to be made now .

It is just incredible to me that so many people accept the basic premise that evolutionists put out there , which is that there is enough variation within a species that would genetically disallow a portion of the population to breed .

We have some major flaws in our legal system . The first and foremost legal flaw is that American prisoners are American people and thus are granted first ammendment American rights . This means that murderers who do n't get birthday cakes , a basketball court , tv , and a turkey for Thanksgiving go crying cruel and unusual punishment and then they get it . I 've heard that the average cost of living of a capital punishment prisoner is appoximately $ 25,000.00 a year paid for by us . It 's really bad when murderers on deathrow in Mexico are calling murderers on deathrow in America p*****s and want to transfer here . LEVIATHAN

So , we are forced , in the interest of continuing dialogue , to point out all of the flaws in there argument .

But you ignored an important part of your own quote , `` Thus , without an independent criterion for fitness , other than survival , ... '' And of course , Darwin did most certainly express other criterion besides survival . Let me help clarify for you . Survival is not the sole requirement , or even the most important requirement . It should be quite clear to even the most muddled thinker that reproduction is required . In fact , reproduction is the most important requirement . Survival is necessary only long enough for an organism to reproduce , and if an organism does n't reproduce , it is an evolutionary dead end no matter how long it survives . You see , as was mentioned in your definitions and in comments , natural selection is differential reproduction . Natural selection is not a tautology . Only the phrase , `` survival of the fittest '' reduces to a tautology .
I 'm a little surprised by this . The polls I 've seen show that Mass voters favor gay marriage . I would have thought that getting those who oppose it to put their opposition on the record before the elections would be beneficial . Then again , seeing as how the lies and fear mongering have already started , I can see how they might want to avoid having the elections muddied with the inevitable dirty fighting that would be thrown at them . Not the most couragous stance , but perhaps safer in the long run . You are right that the longer society fails to collapse the more inane the doomsayers seem .
This just happens to be one of my favorite ID concepts . The concept of impossible improbabilities . If it is unlikely , then it is impossible .
Yes ... because black people are Neanderthals
Also , The `` pro-lifers '' here need to learn something if they wish to get their message across . When you call someone an XXXXX or insulting people they will not listen to you . I believe many pro-lifers on here are not doing a good job with presenting their message because of this . I believe the pro-lifers are correct and do not need to resort to tactics of name-calling in order to prove a point . Use facts and reason and the answer to abortion is clear .
This is the reason why many people believe it - because evolution justifies atheism . It justifies the immoral life that many people live .
This is a very fundamental difference how anti-gunners view the 2nd Amendment and the nature of rights . They think of the Bill of Rights as a 'permission slip ' , the view the text as proof that the government gives us rights . The government does nothing of that sort , the Bill of Rights as a document declares that government is FORBIDEN to grab power over the issuses and rights mentioned in the Bill of Rights .
probably because I want him to think for himself ( assuming a he ) and not be fed stuff from people that ca n't respect others wishes like yourself . Do you realize that there was a time when abortion was illegal and that dead infants were not just lining the streets . Stop with straw-man arguments that you hold so dear .

Do me a favor Calli . Tell me the definition of a transitional fossil . What would you expect a transitional fossil to look like ? What would you call a fossil that had both reptillian and avian features ?
Hey Sarge , that looks like something I saw yesterday . New anti-gun strategy : Demonize CCW holders Anti-gunners . Why do you HATE our Constitutions Bill of Rights ? Why do you persecute people who can pass a background check not only once , but every time they purchase a new gun ? You told America that this would satisfy you , when this new law was proposed ! But NO ! You demonize us anyway ! We prove our lawfulness not only when we purchase a new gun , but also CCW people have to pass another background check when they apply for a Concealed Handgun License , then take a test and classes to boot ? We already have 22 to 30 thousand gun laws . When are you going to be reasonable ? So what 's the deal ? Why do you HATE America so much ? Why do you HATE us law-abiding people who keep our noses clean all of our lives ? Heck , I am 62 and have never run afoul of our laws . Do you think we are going to start now ?
We can not guess what they might be . Nevertheless , we can still makes statements about the statistical likelihood of such an accident occurring , yes ? Does that accurate statement of probability mean that my fate on the road is literally determined by a dice roll , that if my number comes up , I crash , with 'chance as causality ' ? Of course not . We are merely describing the likelihood of an event in a system of which we have imperfect knowledge . As our knowledge of the system increases , our assessment of that likelihood changes : if you know my age and gender , my driving habits , my route and how busy or quiet it is - all these things permit a more accurate assessment of the odds . If we had perfect knowledge of a deterministic system , the odds would be 1 or 0 .

Do n't expect Scalia to be too friendly to this case , and of course whatever Scalia does Thomas does . It would be sadly ironic if we progunrights people lost this case even with Kennedy 's vote .
Yup , she is . Because a feetus is not legaly a person . Morally , I don`t view infants as persons either , but as you have to draw the line somehwere , you might as well do it at birth ( or at some time during pregnancy , I don`t really care as long as the choice of aborting a unwanted pregnancy is till viable for most people ) .
Can you prove Neanderthal Man was a human descendant ? because DNA tests dont prove that out and yet PHDs and Masters Degreed scientists insist they are .

So what are some examples of restrictive gun laws in South Africa ? The people in South Africa think their gun laws are not strict enough . In one of your previous posts you seem determined to use South Africa as evidence that outlawing guns does n't work . But gun ownership is still legal there .
But I dont believe you can separate the two . And not only do I believe that the organism can effect the environment , but the environment can also effect the organism . Its another two-way street that evolutionists have chosen to completely abandon because of their head-in-the-sand version of science which validates their atheist agenda . But see I have a theory as to why science must do this : Its because science has come to realization that all animals have brains and consciousness in varying forms . These , of course , are the anti-science because science can not explain such a phenomenon . But the fact is each animal has its own brain  and each brain comes pre-programmed with its own abilities according to how God designed it . Each animal has a different function and different abilities . God knew beforehand that environmental circumstances would be changing , thus he gave each organism the ability to change with it . This is simple common sense .
Not really . If you get heart disease from constantly eating bad foods and doing nothing about it then it 's your own damn fault . But if you 're attacked while going on a nightly walk and robbed at knifepoint , you 're not the one that should receive the blame for the crime that happened .
Why must you people come to threads I 'm on and derail them with ridiculous minutia rather than actually deal with the debate that is being argued ? I 'll tell you why . Because you know that the living chimpanzee that shares 98 % of our genetic code , and is living evidence that such shared DNA is in no way evidence of human descent at all completely nullifies and negates all of the claims made by evolutionists that these genetic markers in long dead animals could possibly ever be proven to actually be our ancestors . It is common sense evidence of the delusions of the secular humanist to insist that evo is anything more than wishful thinking . That is why you will all derail the thread with stupid attacks rather than even try to deal with the points I 've raised that you ca n't answer . So here are five quotes of Peeling making the same basic claim in our short debate together which is why I asked for this evidence to support his claims .
No , the vast majority of them are unwanted . That is why there are so many abortions .

I asked first . Tell me one proof of evolution . I can tell you right now that I have been studying evolution for a while and I am very confident in what I know . You tell me what evidence it has and I 'll tell you exactly how it does n't workout . P.S Have you your heard of a guy named kent Hoviand ? You did n't answer me with evidence in the first place , could it be that you do n't have any ? And anyone who answers my question of `` how someone can say its full of lies '' with a sarcastic remark such as `` opening mouth and uttering truth '' is full of stupidity and needs to grow up and start supporting what they believe instead of trying to ACT smart . And your THEORY is not proven .
I was n't sure , but I recognized that post as probably yours . I agree of course . The reason they ca n't address it is largely because the concept of ID has completley exposed one of their main arguments , that is that creationists start with a premise and try to make all the evidence lead to it . Which we do , the Bible . And they do the exact same thing with Darwinism . Their opposition to ID ( a concept without premise ) has exposed it .

Hey , bring it on . A month ago , I read over your 'failed prophecies ' and if you are ready to listen , there is no problem explaining what happened with Nebuchadnezzar and Egypt . It is mature fare and hard for even Christians to accept sometimes , but the long and short of it is this : you do n't even begin to know the God you are dealing with . If you give me a space of time to get things together , I can introduce you to a being who is so much like you that you will almost be fooled into feeling that you 're his `` buddy '' then I will introduce you to the same being who can tear you to pieces if he chooses ( Ps . 50 ) Here 's a hint though about what happened in Egypt : God changed his mind . But you did n't know he could do that ? You would be surprised how much like you he really is . He changed his mind several times in the text of the Bible : Abraham tried to get Him to but could n't get Him to stop his destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah , God was out to kill Moses ' sons , but Moses quickly circumcised them and God changed his mind , also Moses succeeded in changing God 's mind when Moses learned that He was out to destroy the Israelites , God was determined to level Ninevah but after Jonah preached He changed his mind because the people repented , God spoke to the prophet Jeremiah saying : When I pronounce judgment on a peoples but they later turn from their sins , I will change my mind concerning the judgment I had determined on them . But be careful - when He is set on doing something , it gets done . Just when you think you have a `` pal '' in God , he says something like this to the prophet Ezekiel : when a land sins against Me , though Noah and Daniel and Job are in it , they will deliver but their own souls . Even righteous Noah could n't stay the hand of the Almighty when He was dead set on destroying the first world . Real quick : one of the major ways God judges a people group is via another wicked people or wicked king . Happens time and time again in scripture . Do n't have time to elaborate right now . Nebuchadnezzar was a wicked king and in God 's hand he was simply a pawn to use to punish other nations . So while God is using him to punish Egypt , He is punishing Nebuchadnezzar and his nation as well . Get it ? Is it too mature for you ? Do n't believe it ? Too bad ... .it 's true . God will bring a nation to full dominance and power in order to punish other nations . When He is through using them , He will often turn His wrath on the punishing nation who was His original `` servant '' so to speak . This is mature teaching . Most Christians do n't like it . Too bad ... .it 's true . You do n't even begin to understand the God you are dealing with and the One you are rebelling against and the One you are defying day by day . One day , He will be finished with you as well . Psalms gives your day of prophecy like this ( God is speaking ) : All these things you have done and I kept silent . You thought I was altogether like you , but I will come and and rebuke you and tear you to pieces . Ps 50:21 Know what happened with your 'failed prophecy ? ' God changed His mind ! Maybe you ought to start praying that He will change His mind about your destiny as well .
To say that an all knowing and loving God would prevent any suffering among the innocent is assuming that a lack of suffering is the best situation for us in God 's view . God can be all powerful and loving and still , innocents will suffer due to the poor choices of others .
My stance on morality is based on the following observations : 1 . `` I '' for me means my mental self , with my physical self just tagging along . 2 . I do not wish to suffer or to have those I care about suffer . 3 . I feel empathy toward others and often feel sorry for the suffering of others . Those are observations , not proclamations . The way I choose a moral code to avoid the problem of suffering is to essentially make a theoretical deal with others to have a mutual moral code that we will all treat each other as we ourselves would be treated - in this way , all of us can win out and I solve my problem of points 2 and 3 . Perhaps there are other better ways of finding a solution for societies to avoid suffering , but I have n't heard of one . I did not choose this solution arbitrarily . I chose it since it makes sense and should theoretically work and since many , if not most people , at least make some effort at using that moral code anyway so this moral code is at least partially universally adopted . It is the best moral option I have ever heard to address my concern about suffering . What is arbitrary about the reasoning I presented above ? What unsupported proclamations do you claim that I have made ? Either way , are you proposing that all moral systems are equally arbitrary and therefore equally valid ? In your scenario , someone could come up with an arbitrary proclamation `` black people should be slaves to white people '' and build a morality based on that . My moral approach questions that proclamation as well and thus avoids un-necessary human suffering .
Folks that see threats everywhere they look are already slaves to their paranoia .
Sunday 's cowardly assassination of abortion doctor George Tiller demonstrates once again that the U.S. is not all that different from Pakistan . One thing that these two violent societies share is having a group of rabid religious fundamentalists who are each on a jihad against those in their nation with whom they disagree , and who are ready to kill and maim their enemies without mercy or hesitation . The other thing -- perhaps the more dangerous thing -- that they share is a government apparatus in which certain elements are overtly or surreptitiously supportive of the jihadists , and in which other elements are cowed into silence and inaction .
I 'm sorry but the baby is a part of both of them . Should it be that the mother decides to keep the baby and the father want 's her to terminate the state will still come chasing for child support . Why the father did n't get a say on if the baby was born or not so why should he have to pay child supportbecause the law says so .
I think its a good thing and it does make the family superior and makes heterosexual behavior superior and right in my eyes .
With enough of a population size , you can check the effects of dozens of variables at once .
Once again this only confirms my belief that republicans are evil and celebrate gay oppression . http : //www.365gay.com/Newscon07/06/062007yorkmar.htm We even have one quote . So it seems that gay people and our families are to remain 2nd class citizens to preserve this evil mans heterosexual privledge . How is it that `` the way he was brought up '' is more important then protecting gay people ? What of they way gay people were brought up ? What about the threat to our freedom that Brian Kolb and his evil religion and political party represents ? I was brought up by my father , taught in school that all people are equal . His refusal to extend marriage to gay people is a threat to me and I do feel harmed and it is a challenge to the way I was brought up . I do live in Michigan and not in New York but his evil statements and attitude are the same here if not worse . I was shocked to find out the Romney was the son of a former Michigan governor and that he is from Michigan . Does figure with all the anti gay religious nut cases that are swarming in the woods here in Michigan .
How can the Bible be used as a source while you deny the truth of its claims ? What parts of the Bible are true , and how do you disguingish between the information that is true and not true ? I wonder how a modern court would view the testimony of 500 credible witnesses to a supernatural event ?
How about the ability to marry multiple partners ? Or do you think that nothing is capable of undermining the institution of marriage ?
Is n't the point pretty obvious-
What is the problem with reptile to bird lung evolution ? Plausible scenarios exist . Are you saying it could n't have evolved ?
it 's the other way around :
I agree that the 98 % statistic is not central to Lott 's book . However , it does cast a shadow on his academic honesty . James Lindgren notes inconsistencies in Lott 's claims about the 98 % statistic- http : //www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~lambert/guns/lindgren.htm
If they can stage jihads in school , teach `` acceptance '' of `` different '' religions and beliefs , and teach our children that evolution is a fact , they can sure as heck teach creation along with everything else .
How can you possibly equate prostitution to gay marriage ? And would society break down if some individuals are allowed to enter into a legally protecting penumbra institution we call marriage ? Probably not .

Sorry my brain was n't working that early this morning . What I was trying to say was I ca n't understand those who wish to completely take guns away from civilians . Now I think it does get a little extreme with owning several M-16s , but if I want to own a pistol , a shotgun , and some fancy automatic , well that 's my right .
As theorized , the concept of evolution is analogous to slow morphing , rather than quick abrupt changes in a species . MORPHING ! , as can be done with computer graphics programs designed by intelligent beings . Evolution implies species go through a process of advantagous and purposful change -- but morphing is accomplished by unintelligent random processes , or at least that 's how the story goes -- the created universe and life were random events . I have been patiently waiting for many years but to date have never seen or heard of any species morphing into another species . I am aware of genetic defects that limit species but unaware of mutations that perpetuate new species . Clearly variation within species is possible and has been observed , such as poodles and great danes , but they remain members of the same species . Mankind has thousands of years of written history and I am unaware of anyone observing species morphation ( Is that a word ? ) . Although it is approaching 200 years after Darwin hypothesised how species might have originated , we are no closer to observing a species morphing than Darwin . Humans attempt to create new species , such as breeding donkey with horses to get mules and lions with tigers to get ligers , but these `` NEW '' species are almost always born sterile and unable to perpetuate themselves . Besides observing it , the way to demonstrate evolution is to manipulate a species until it developes into a new species , but alas , then all you will have proven is directed efforts of intelligent beings create species . Hmm , wonder what intelligent being ( s ) created us ?
I seriously doubt it 's that dangerous , for that reason anyway . Your son could be in as much danger as much as any child for lots of different reasons ( traffic , for instance ) .
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahahahahahaha . The deliberately out-of-context quotes again that directly contradict the conclusions of the authors .
1 ) Reptile develops feathers . They offer reduced protection . They itch . Rustle in the bush . Feathers devolve .
Actually , materialism does not have any answer for what 'drives ' any organization , when you take the broad view . Meaning that their reliance on terms like 'law ' , 'force ' , 'energy ' , etc. , are only labels for unobserved non-corporeal , non-substantial , non-mateial , 'drivers ' , that are inferred from observations of certain repetitive , iterated 'change ' phenomena/effects detected within this temporal , physical , substantial , corporeal universe . What these 'drivers ' are , in and of themselves , is beyond materialism 's power to explain , so it simply evades that fundamental question and starts with a universe , a reality , that 'just happened , that 's all ' . Ex nihilo . Ab nihilo .
Creationist make little quips about how evolution must be a racist theory et cetera but when I ask them to explain in more detail they just disappear . I find this quite annoying what should I do about it ?
That is amazing . I find it crazy that this baby is much younger and smaller and far less developed than many of the babies that are aborted . Abortion is murder .
Although it is approaching 200 years after Darwin hypothesised how species might have originated , we are no closer to observing a species morphing than Darwin .
That 's just the most egregious mass shooting in the good old US of A .
Wow someone has a bad case of privledge and just not heterosexual . BTW it is voting on my life . I am being denied something that heterosexuals take forgranted . Heck some heteros take it so forgranted that they even have 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 0r 7 marriages yet they deny me one .
I believe that it is possible God created the universe with a Big Bang . I also believe that some evolutionary process had to be made in order for life to begin on Earth . That being said , I do not believe in the `` missing link '' of Evolution where humans came from monkey 's . There is still myriads of inconclusive evidence and missing holes and gaps within the theory itself .
If it had there would be scientific peer reviewed papers supporting macro-evolution . Not one exist-not one .
So , can I not be considered `` ignorant '' for not thinking that evolution has been proven and not be considered `` anti-Christian '' for not thinking that the Earth is exactly 6000 years old .
Carrying a gun is their talisman against their fear of attack and injury , what do you think ?
The chances are , most of us here are familiar with answersingenesis.org and other creationist-lie websites . Science and apologetics are their weak suits : misrepresentation and dishonesty are their strong suits . They rely on their target audience being ignorant of science and thus easily fooled by their falsehoods , half-truths and misrepresentation of science . If there was any validity to their `` refuting '' of solid evidence against a literal interpretation of Genesis , then their ideas would be out their in the science mainstream of science journals , rather than relegated to some backwater of the web . Why should we go to their site though and allow them to selectively pick which emails they wish to repsond to on their terms ? Let them come here or to another public forum and put themselves on the line in an open and live debate . I have layed down a challenge to all creationists to come here and formally debate any aspect of evolution they want with me . If you think these people at answersingenesis.org are so hot on the topic , invite them over . They wo n't come though , for their arguments do not stand up to real debate by people who understand the topic . Of course I would be overjoyed if you proved me wrong by getting one to show their face here . Good luck .
Well you have n't proven that you do n't support the idea of a dictatorship .
What sort of different laws ? Also , note that Omegamon/Ethmi 's argument is often 'we do n't want any more laws , criminals do n't obey them anyway ! ' The main reason , however , is the 'less guns in the hands of criminals ' .
In short , all of materialism/mechanism/physicalism/positivism/naturalism/darwinism/geneticism reduces to giving credit to effects for being their own causes . Which earns a great big , `` DUH ! ! `` , from me .
Personally i do n't believe in abortion . It 's morally wrong and i think it 's good that it 's illegal .

'This [ gun ] gave him the capability to fire as fast as he could pull the trigger . And that 's a lot of rounds when you 've got a 50-round magazine .

The 17 % can only be attached to those weapons for which there was a successful trace back to the US from the group of 11,000 submitted by Mexican authorities . The percentage of the total confiscated that actually came from the US is not known since some submitted for trace could n't be traced while the majority confiscated were not even requested to be traced , for whatever reason .
Firstly , the core word is 'might ' . Thus it is not the all conclusive proof Darwinists would suggest . Where is the evidence that random changes did occur as they say ? What caused these changes ? Why were they only positive changes ?

SAN FRANCISCO - A federal judge challenged the backers of California 's voter-enacted ban on same-sex marriage Wednesday to explain how allowing gay couples to wed threatens conventional unions , a demand that prompted their lawyer to acknowledge he did not know . The unusual exchange between U.S. District Chief Judge Vaughn Walker and Charles Cooper , a lawyer for the group that sponsored Proposition 8 , came during a hearing on a lawsuit challenging the measure as discriminatory under the U.S. Constitution . Cooper had asked Walker to throw out the suit or make it more difficult for those civil rights claims to prevail . The judge not only refused but signaled that when the case goes to trial in January , he expects Cooper and his legal team to present evidence showing that male-female marriages would be undermined if same-sex marriages were legal . & # 8216 ; Naturally procreative relationships & # 8217 ; The question is relevant to the assertion that Proposition 8 is constitutionally valid because it furthers the states goal of fostering `` naturally procreative relationships , '' Walker explained . `` What is the harm to the procreation purpose you outlined of allowing same-sex couples to get married ? '' Walker asked . `` My answer is , I do n't know . I do n't know , '' Cooper answered . Moment later , after assuring the judge his response did not mean Proposition 8 was doomed to be struck down , Cooper tried to clarify his position . The relevant question was not whether there is proof that same-sex unions jeopardize marriages between men and women , but whether `` the state is entitled , when dealing with radical proposals to make changes to bedrock institutions such as this ... to take a wait and see attitude , '' he said . `` There are things we ca n't know , that 's my point , '' Cooper said . `` The people of California are entitled to step back and let the experiment unfold in Massachusetts and other places , to see whether our concerns about the health of marital unions have either been confirmed or perhaps they have been completely assuaged . '' Walker pressed on , asking again for specific `` adverse consequences '' that could follow expanding marriage to include same-sex couples . Cooper cited a study from the Netherlands , where gay marriage is legal , showing that straight couples were increasingly opting to become domestic partners instead of getting married . `` Has that been harmful to children in the Netherlands ? What is the adverse effect ? '' Walker asked . & # 8216 ; Proof of no harm ? & # 8217 ; Cooper said he did not have the facts at hand . `` But it is not self-evident that there is no chance of any harm , and the people of California are entitled not to take the risk , '' he said . `` Since when do Constitutional rights rest on the proof of no harm ? '' Walker parried , adding the First Amendment right to free speech protects activities that many find offensive , `` but we tolerate those in a free society . '' Walker made clear that he wants to examine other issues that are part of the political rhetoric surrounding same-sex marriage but rarely surface in courtrooms . Among the questions he plans to entertain at the trial are whether sexual orientation is a fixed or immutable characteristic , whether gays are a politically powerful group , and if same-sex marriage bans such as Proposition 8 were motivated by anti-gay bias .
Originally posted by voiceofreason OK ... . Well , that standard does n't show that gun ownership is a God-given right . I do n't know of any animals that own guns . Also I think that I would have a better chance at preserving myself if I lived in a society that had more gun-control . Look at Canada- it has less homicide and less gun violence than the US and more gun-control . So I do n't see how gun-control interferes with self-preservation .
Science defines what is valid and what is n't , just like the church .
This is ridiculous and barbaric . This woman should have had access to safe , legal and easily accessible abortion . It is shameful that she should have been reduced to such circumstances .
Matt Speckman , a former Turlock police sergeant , used to be in charge of processing concealed gun permits . Now retired , he 'd like one himself . `` I 'm not a gun nut , '' Speckman said . `` But I 've been involved in investigations of people now getting paroled who have probably been throwing darts at my picture in their cells . '' Speckman , 49 , attended the FBI academy , trained at a nationally recognized firearms course , earned an MBA , is studying for a Ph.D , toted a gun for 30 years and screened gun permit applicants for seven years . Yet Turlock Police Chief Gary Hampton and Sheriff Adam Christianson , both of whom have approved gun permits for politicians and prominent businessmen , turned him down . Speckman since has moved from Turlock and says he does n't obsess about his safety . But reports about people who find favor with law enforcement executives despite relative lack of experience , he says , point up the arbitrary nature of concealed gun permits in California , where many agencies endure charges of political favoritism . As commander of his former department 's internal affairs , Speckman once investigated a former officer whose resignation was demanded in lieu of firing , he said . But Christianson approved a permit for the former officer two weeks before denying Speckman 's , he said . Having been on the other side , Speckman said he understands the heavy burden of determining good cause . What if someone granted a permit uses a gun recklessly ? On the other hand , what if someone denied a permit later is harmed ? `` I understand the need for case by case ( discretion ) , '' he said . `` But the intent of the law is that someone who has more chance of being victimized should be given a permit . `` It 's just gotten to the point where I wish there were something a little bit more standard . '' He 's experienced firsthand the threats that can follow people who work in the judicial system . That 's one reason the list of people who have concealed weapons permits in Stanislaus County contains judges , deputy district attorneys and retired police officers . In 1991 , two men broke into Speckman 's home when he was away and met him at the front door when he returned -- armed with his own handgun . He was ordered face-down on the front lawn . `` ( The gunman ) said , 'You 're going to learn to die execution-style , ' `` Speckman recalled , and fired two or three rounds into the grass before fleeing . The men later were arrested , sent to prison and paroled . Although Speckman since has moved , neighbors told him they twice saw the gunman lurking around his former home . Sheriffs and police chiefs in California generally observe a court standard requiring them to judge a concealed weapon applicant 's `` good moral character '' and `` good cause . '' It 's among a minority of `` may issue '' states , while adults meeting lower standards for buying firearms can get permits for the asking in 37 `` shall issue '' states ; Alaska and Vermont allow people to carry concealed weapons without permits . Neither Christianson nor Hampton could be reached Friday , the same day a Bee article noted that Hampton takes political office into account when issuing permits . Two of seven he 's approved are held by Turlock City Council members . Speckman said Hampton refused to consider his application when his one-year permit expired a year after he retired , and referred him to the sheriff 's office , which has licensed 52 Turlock residents . `` You do not meet our criteria for issuance , '' reads Christianson 's June rejection letter to Speckman . Speckman said he knew nothing about Hampton 's unique request in 2008 to the sheriff asking him not to issue permits to Turlock residents without first sending them to Turlock police , until reading about it in recent Bee stories . Hampton 's request came about the time Speckman retired ; Christianson this week indicated he respects the request but retains authority to ignore it . No one in Christianson 's office said anything about the Turlock arrangement , Speckman said . So he took a $ 100 firearms refresher course and paid $ 108 in permit fees only to be turned away , he said . `` No one said to me , 'We do n't do Turlock ; do n't waste your money because we 're going to deny it , ' `` he said . Sheriff Adam Christianson is scheduled to address the issue of concealed weapon permits in a meeting of the Madison Society Foundation at 7 p.m. Monday in the Stanislaus County Library , 1500 I St. , Modesto .
Have we ever seen an example of life emerging from a sterile , lifeless environment ?
Certainly science has provided part of the answer with their finding of the Mitachondrial `` Eve '' , suggesting that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human populations .
we shamefully mistreated the Intelligent Design ( ID ) theorists by lumping them in with creationists . Creationists believe that God designed all life , and thats a somewhat religious idea . But ID theorists think that at unspecified times some unnamed superpowerful entity designed life , or maybe just some species , or maybe just some of the stuff in cells . Thats what makes ID a superior scientific theory : it doesnt get bogged down in details .

Yes , you are right - the Civil War was fought to keep the union in tact . But , it is also a fact that Abraham Lincoln , the Commander in Chief of the Union Army , did not believe that the union could be preserved unless slavery was abolished .
Ok , this makes sense . I do think however , that wanted pregnancies should be a part of the abortion debate , even though as you say , they usually are not . Part of the abortion issue ( and the most important part , IMO ) is the perception of pregnancy itself . If society moves in a direction where having a baby is looked upon as a negative thing , this is not good . One way to help make abortion rarer is to help people view having a baby as a positive thing . As Clinton himself once said , abortion should be rare .
There have been so many school shootings over the last 40 years that researchers have been able to develop a profile of the typical mass murderer . They 're called `` active shooters '' or `` active killers '' and their crimes play out in a matter of minutes . After the Columbine High School massacre in 1999 , police changed their tactics . The two student gunmen killed 15 people and themselves before the SWAT team was in position . Commanders realized that it simply takes too long to assemble a tactical team in time to stop an active killer . The new tactics developed in response to Columbine involved creating an ad-hoc tactical team using the first four or five patrol officers on the scene . They would enter the shooting scene in a diamond formation with guns pointing in all directions . This technique was employed by police departments around the country . Then 32 people were killed by a lone gunman at Virginia Tech in April 2007 . Seung Hui Cho shot 47 people , 30 fatally , in the university 's Norris Hall in just 11 minutes . That means every minute he killed more than three people and shot a total of four . Once again , the gunman continued shooting until a four-officer team made entry and then he killed himself . Law enforcement reviewed its tactics . Based on the Virginia Tech data , experts determined the first officer on scene should make entry immediately with an aggressive attack on the shooter . Every minute the officer waits for back-up , another three or more people could die . In other words , while it was once considered suicide for a lone officer to take on an active killer , it is now considered statistical homicide for him not to do so . Tactical Defense Institute in Adams County , Ohio developed one of the first `` single officer response '' programs in the nation . TDI was teaching the tactic even before Virginia Tech . Now the National School Resource Officer Organization ( NSRO ) is using TDI instructors to teach school resource officers how to confront a gunman immediately . Locally , all Blue Ash police officers are trained in these new tactics in large part because their chief , Col. Chris Wallace , is also a TDI instructor . The other statistic that emerged from a study of active killers is that they almost exclusively seek out `` gun free '' zones for their attacks . In most states , concealed handguns are prohibited at schools and on college campuses even for those with permits . Many malls and workplaces also place signs at their entrances prohibiting firearms on the premises . Now tacticians believe the signs themselves may be an invitation to the active killers . The psychological profile of a mass murderer indicates he is looking to inflict the most casualties as quickly as possible . Also , the data show most active killers have no intention of surviving the event . They may select schools and shopping malls because of the large number of defenseless victims and the virtual guarantee no on the scene one is armed . As soon as they 're confronted by any armed resistance , the shooters typically turn the gun on themselves .
Well ? Let 's get to it . Why do YOU believe ?
