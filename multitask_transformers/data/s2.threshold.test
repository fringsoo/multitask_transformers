hahahahahah . That place is holy water to vampires . Arch and Cash will never post there . Arch and Cash arguing honest arguments where they ca n't threaten eternal damnation , call people liars and insult them as the basis of their arguments ? never going to happen .
So this singularity that appeared out of no were became a greater singularity which took on perfect balance and form ?
Well ... yes.. it does ... and it makes adam ... and eve ... rather ... hairy ...
WOW it comes down to this ; heterosexuals are given a privledge just because of who they are and who they love . Gay people are denied equal treatment to heterosexuals because of who they are and who they love . The way I understand this is that segregation deined blacks equal treatment to whites because of who they where . You would not deny that the latter is a civil rights issue but you can not bring yourself to see the former is also . Why is that ? So what you are saying is that it is ok to discriminate based upon sexual orientation but not race or religion ? Why ? When heterosexuality and homosexuality are treated equally and both are considered normal and acceptable then I will move on . There is nothing wrong with being gay , it is not a sin , and it is not immoral . Until being gay is considered equal to being a hetero then you will just have to continue being sick of hearing about it . I am sick of hearing evil funamenalists insult my family because of who we are . I am sick of being denied marriage because of someone elses privledge , and religious beliefs . Btw this is also the definition of marriage from this site http : //dictionary.reference.com/browse/marriage
So ? Last time I checked , MASS MURDER was against the law . Did n't care too much for following that one , did he ? This is like pointing out that the man who drove through a retirement community killing 3 elderly people and 2 grandchildren in a drunk driving accident was a liquor store owner . According to your logic , this would mean he was a drunk driver because he was a liquor store owner , therefore , all liquor store owners are drunk drivers . But according to my logic , instead of focusing on a mere `` feel good '' bit of information , I would look at the actual drunk driving records of liquor store owners . What if I found out that this was the only incident of a liquor store owner killing someone in the past 50 years ? Which is closer to the truth : Your assertion that liquor store owners are all dangerous because of this one incident , or mine that they are n't because of the actual facts ? The state of Virginia has no requirement for a CCW permit . CCW permits are available for request for those citizens who desire documentation in order to carry in other states . There have been over 225,000 permits issued in Virginia . This means : HOW MANY PEOPLE CARRY HAVING NOT REQUESTED A PERMIT ? ( We know at least 225,000 are carrying there because they have requested one ) ... ..let 's be conservative and say that half of them have done so . This means that over 50 % of gun carriers enjoy paperwork . My guess would be less than half desire documentation , but hey , I 'm gon na be conservative . So , over 500,000 people carrying CCW in Virginia everyday and one of them goes nuts . This means that CCW holders account for less than 1/10th of 1 percent of shootings in Virginia . ( It looks like this - < .01 % ) What 's the murder rate for the general population in Virginia , Penfold ? By stating that this one shooter had a CCW , are you trying to point out to us that the crime rate for CCW holders in Virginia is 20 times better than the general population , or 50 times better ? Maybe you 're trying to point out that it 's 75 times better ? Even if it 's only 10 times better ... ... ... .it is still better ( in multiples ) than NON CCW holders ! WHAT DO YOU FAIL TO GRASP ABOUT CCW HOLDERS COMMITTING SUBSTANTIALLY FAR FEWER CRIMES THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD ? ( BTW : This is just CCW holders in Virginia . Now go through the entire nation ! ... ... and you point out that one has committed a murder ! Wow ! That 's a real crime wave ! One out of millions and millions ! Whew ! Maybe if another CCW holder commits another murder in a few more years IT WILL BE A TREND ! )
Foolish Clergymen . How can this work ? How can you take something as serious as the supposed Holy word of God and say that ? I mean if you cant take something as simple as what is said in genesis and beleive it then why the XXXX would people beleive in anything else the bible has to say ? If there is falsehood in it then how can any of it be trusted ? If the Creation , Adam and Eve , Noah and the ark are just there to serve as the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation . That is Absolutly ridiculous . Why stop with that ? Why not continue on to say that the story of Jesus was jsut a way for man to relate to God ? Oh but then it continues doesnt it ? Yes it does ! Nothing in the bible is to be beleived unless it is all beleived as a whole . It is torn apart . You can not pick and choose parts of this religion as it fits your needs . It simply must be all or nothing . Otherwise you are wasting your time .
Actually , that 's just not true . Perhaps if you actually educated yourself about the topic . A good place to start would be Dalrymple 's `` The Age of the Earth . '' Maybe if you learned how and why such dating techniques work you would n't look so foolish .
Okay I dont care what you call it , but lets take it back to the human being part . If your brain was transplanted into Steves body , would the new person have your memory and your life experiences and your reasoning powers ? For instance , you believe a human being begins at conception . If Steve believed a human being began at birth , would this new individual believe that a human began at conception or at birth ?
For any of you who missed it : Those soft bones can be molded in the first few `` days , weeks , or months , '' says sport , but Neanderthal infants got bony brow ridges because they were doing so much vigorous chewing . supersport also insists that Neanderthals were fully human . Last I checked , it took a long time for enough of a human 's teeth to erupt in order to vigorously chew meat . Once again , supersport has proposed an idea that we can test scientifically . All he has to do is secure guardianship of a newborn and feed said newborn a nice , healthy , high-in-protein diet requiring heavy chewing . If the child ends up looking like a Neanderthal , supersport will be vindicated . What are you waiting for , supersport ? Oh , I get it : you 're doing to do the peppered moth experiment first , right ? Then you 'll do the Great Dane × Chihuahua to produce Chihuahuas experiment . Only then will you get around to this one ... To respond to some of the other comments in this thread : supersport was eventually banned from IIDB for ignoring directions of moderators . While there , he averaged over 50 posts per day of trolling . His points were -- without fail -- repeatedly slapped down in the most convincing fashion imaginable : IIDB is crawling with experts in various fields , evolutionary and molecular biology certainly not excepted . Every time supersport 's argument would get slaughtered indisputably from countless angles , he 'd abandon the thread and start a new one , usually saying pretty much the same thing . supersport has said that nobody from there dares come over here to debate him . I know that Collin and I are both here and on IIDB ; the fact that the majority of the people over there make me look like a novice coupled with the fact that supersport has n't fared too well here should tell anybody who has any semblance of reasoning that supersport is once again talking out of his XXX . Do n't take his word for it , but you do n't have to take my word for it , either : head over to IIDB and do a search for threads started by supersport . It 'll only take the first couple of pages to see him thrashed , but I certainly wo n't stop you from reading more of the carnage .
Yes this is absurd . All things are subject to the Will of God the Creator . Nothing exists or can exist that is not subject to God 's Will . God is not perfect at everything . God is not perfectly evil either . Your analogy is flawed . Try again .
And yet , and yet ... all these unprovable assumptions and unprovable conclusions and unverifiable predictions , all this faulty and misleading nonsense based on nothing more substantial than a desire to deny the existence of god ... keeps paying off .
so you finding it difficult to accept `` harsh reality '' , you make it `` look like '' ... because you like that better . Sorry , it does n't work that way .
So your point is that gun owners are terrorists ?
So again , this points to the fact that the appeals system is effective at preventing `` innocent '' people from being executed ? I had asked for 5 examples of innocent people who were executed . Chemist99a stated that `` we execute too many innocent people '' . Someone has yet to give me 5 examples of innocents that we have executed . And by the way : The information about the seven `` potentially innocent '' people that have been executed is quite laughable in some cases .
But there are some evangelical Christian churches that do n't do that . You do n't seem to understand or recognize that evangelicalism is a very varied movement .
No dissonance - you just ca n't see past your strawmen . I 'm a methodological naturalist , not a strict determinist , and I consider that free-will and volition are gradually emergent properties .

How is symbiotic relations beteween plants and insects sign of creation ?
Well , it is probably a different taste from what you are used to . I personally love Hershey 's but that 's probably because I grew up on it . European chocolate is supposed to be better but I do n't have the taste buds for it ... but I still like it . Plus Hershey Park was fun as a kid . Now can we please stay on topic and talk about candy ?
DNA that defined a biological system or function that did not exist in a organism before a mutation and benefits the creature significantly enough to change it 's reproductive ratio . The most common fallacy in defending evolution is that `` nothing '' in evolution requires a sudden or non-gradual change . Irreducible complexity proves this is incorrect , that gradual natural selection based mutations can only refine existing systems and can not create new ones . Examples exist on such simple life forms as bacteria .
By multi-formation you mean spontaneous , simultaneous mutations in all the related genomes ?
with tens of millions of gun owners , and hundreds of millions of guns in the US , and you think the guns are still the problem ... .
But you do n't have any problem with forcing women to go through pregnancies that they do not want -- forcing them to give birth to children they are unable to care for . Nice .
Sigma , I was only joking . It hit me this morning though that if I 'm willing to talk about abortion without bringing up God , I wonder if the Pro-Choicers could argue their position without bringing up `` women 's rights '' . ; - )
Well it 's a step in the right direction , and if you have 2 or 3 people per household , it would make him squirm good.lol .
the Biblical support for free will is the assumption that God is not willing that any man should perish , but that all should come to repentance . If God chooses everybody 's decisions for them ( or forces them to choose only the options He approves of ) then the trillions of people that are bound for Hell were forced to go there by God himself . in fact , God must have wanted them to go there from the beginning of time . this is obviously contrary to the nature of God according to the Bible , as far as I know
The empire you defend is tyrannical . They are responsible for the death of millions .
But I would have been interested in hearing how you explained the above points . My post was a quick hack job , looked up in a few books that I have along with stuff that I remember from my reading . I may have made an error and would be interested in hearing about it . Maybe I can defend my point of view , maybe I ca n't . If you put time and effort into a response , why delete it . Redundant posts happen . ss/ww wo n't pay attention anyway and maybe he would respond to you . He runs from me because he always seems to make himself look like a fool and he realizes it .
And one of these assumption has not been proven incorrect .
The purpose of the Bill of Rights . Preamble to the Bill of Rights
Count me in for a couple of MP5s . I 'd even take American made M4s if they 're running short on the HKs . I 'll keep the paper sealed ammo tins intact and buy my own ammo . Quality 9mm has gotten so inexpensive I ca n't afford to reload it . 5.56 has always been that way . I like that idea .
While I 'm still iffy on her with the whole New Haven case , and her off-the-bench comments on race , this is one thing I commend her for and agree completely with .
Well , the simple answer to this question is `` No it is not . '' Telling convention to shove it is not one of the main points of being gay , not in any way shape or form . Being gay is simply about the people one is attracted to , the people one loves , and the person one wants to spend his or her life with . Now this does not mean that these people do not tell convention to go shove it , but they do so only when they believe convention is unfair , unjust , unequal , and a detriment to happiness . On the issue of gay rights , most ( but maybe not all ) gay people believe that the specific convention of denying some rights to gay people is a bad one , so they stand against it . They do not simply hate convention because it is convention ; good convention is worth retaining .
Is he anti gay ? Yes so they are all in the same boat and cut from the same hatefilled , homophobic , bigoted , christianist cloth .
OK , you did n't say it . My mistake . But am I wrong in assuming that you agree with their arguments by virtue of having posted quotes by them without rebutting what they have stated ?
Well , that may be true . But the U.S. is blessed with an unusual number of people in which this is not true . One particular brand of christianity that is mostly limited to the U.S. actually rejects science based on mythology . Their religious dogma closes their mind to the reality around them .
I think some of the courts that have quoted that sentence from Heller to justify laws that ban felons from owning firearms would disagree .
So you 're just ignoring the counters I provided above ? Do you think they are irrational ? How are they any more irrational than basing an argument on the premise that `` something is designed '' when you have no basis for concluding that something is designed ?
Yes , I can . In our formal debate , you finished up your first post like this ;
Too damn bad . The nature of the Second Amendment had to be addressed , it was , now shut up and move on .
Actually the kid was on a panel , all pretty much saying the same thing . Why did n't YOU cite them ?
Why do you want to approach in language of least-value of human life by reducing it in comparison to such things as a 'tumor ' ? Obviously a tumor is different simply on the basis that it wo n't be growing into a child and an adult soon ( actually , never ! ) . Why should the fact that something is going to soon grow into a child , adolescent , and adult not factor into whether or not life is valued ? Is the pro-choice position so weak that what is growing inside the mother has to be described in terms of a 'tumor ' ? Jo is right -- and yes , AA ; you should n't have to not value human life just to have the pro-choice position . This attitude of reducing that which will soon grow into a person to the likes of a tumor is the very sort of thing validates some of the complaints pro-lifers sometimes make about the pro-choice movement . Why can you not be pro-choice AND value life ?
So ?
What does this have to do with what you started out with . Ca n't you at least pick a topic and stick with it ? You wander all over the place and only demonstrate you problems in understand written English . Get an education .
I know the fallacy . I have not used that argument .
But how is homosexuality wrong ?
Well , there 's also carbon dating ... Did n't you post something about a decay curve ? Are you now going to deny the accuracy of that ?
And you believed every word they fed you without a second thought . At least now we know whose line you 're peddling . Please , cite your sources to start with in the future . It 's not just a good idea , it 's the rules .
And I 'm sure that your astonishment would grow if you could get Nu Leader to define information . From other discussions it is evident that Nu leader confuses information with meaning .

Did Jesus mention the workshy and lazy ? No matter how much I look I can not find Christ 's view of the benefits system
But if a loved one were murdered for simply protecting his/her family , what would life in prison do for justice ? For you ? For the low-life - but maybe get him paroled for some pacified , gutless reason/excuse ?
Agreed- I 've tried breaking it into bite sized chunks but did n't get any responses here : 1 ) How long does intelligent design take , x years or is it instantaneous ? 2 ) By what mechanism does the designer interact with the natural world ? 3 ) When and why does the designer choose to interact with the world ? 4 ) Why has the vast majority of intelligently designed life ceased to exist ? if it was designed correctly in the first place why was it necessary to discard so many forms and replace them with different ones , as evidenced by the fossil record ? 5 ) What experiments have been conducted to verify the occurence of intelligent design ? I wonder why no answers were forthcoming ?
Sounds to me like the escourt from D.C. had run out of badge ? Do they have title and jurisdiction in that area ? I would imagine shortly we will find who instigated this fiasco . Appears to me they would be better served protesting Freddie and Fannie , the Fed and gov't officials ? Now old sliiiick probably never heard of the Bonus Marchers marching on Washington D.C. during the depression to try to get the benefits they had been promised for WWI and had tanks and guns turned on them even though they were peaceful and camping out with families in tow . The Black Panthers 'policed ' the polls in some places armed with batons but that was all right with the current administration and appears this is too . Sliiiick can see himself turned out on the street and taking revenge on the taxpayers for not being able to pay enough taxes to support his job and others like him . Maybe he can tell us if they plan to use armed force on the taxpayers and thinks this is a fine situation to `` by G-D , make 'em pay '' ! I dunno sliiick , is there a gun angle here ? Protection means exactly what in your vocabulary ?
The christianists who are against gay do n't care that he had commited adultry , got a divorce , or even if he and his wife are swingers . They just are against gay marriage because they hate gay people . It all goes to the tarnishment claim http : //www.slate.com/id/2169615/ they hate us plain and simple and will do anything including voting for someone who is a hypocrite .
First of all , death penalty cases usually cost more than keeping a prisoner alive for his life . http : //www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/arti ... did=108 & amp ; scid=7

I know you 're talking to Jessica , so I will only comment on this . It would be easier to make it rare if pro-life people were n't intent on making it illegal . Pro-choice people have to make it as available as possible to counter pro-life attempts to shut it down entirely . If pro-life people did n't exist , then the reasonable people could work towards making abortion rare . Take the current debates for example . My entire point is that it should not be illegal . That abortion should be available as a safe and legal choice ( it can only be really safe if it 's legal ) . We spend all our time and effort debating the legality that we spend no time on creating programs to help women choose to continue their pregnancies instead of having an abortion , legal or not .
They still have a lower rate of unwanted preganacies than the USA .
I was refering to the very , very clever someone you mentioned in your first post . Now you need to answer my question . Where did he/she/it came from ?
Right . And it 's much easier to argue the root cause , as you pushed for on this forum as well , since you have to deal with fewer arguments . There 's no reason to argue about `` can god lift an unliftable rock '' , if you start at the begining ... define god . -Mach
So you must be opposed to arming law enforcement as well ? By the way , shooting somebody in self defense is not an evil act .
Yes , but how do you legally get it into international waters ? Once there , where do you go ? There are n't too many ports where ordinance is allowed . Since I am a law abiding citizen , where , other than international waters , may I legally have a gun ?
`` True '' is not a good use of language to describe opinion . With regard to his opinion , I think he makes some good points , so I do n't really need to ask him if its true . You on the other hand do need to speak to Olsen as you are claiming his letter rubbishes the concept of evolution- an opinion I hazard he would very much disagree with .
Perhaps by you this is true .
And what 're you going to do when a criminal says `` F**k you and your gun control , it 's not gon na keep me from getting a gun if I want one '' ?
Nope , it is at its mom 's fetal stage ( in the case of humans , 18-45 years before its birth ) .
Well it sure sounds like a good place to have a security business .
Well , you 've convinced me . Instead of letting the poor babies suffer from malnutrition , let 's perform an extremely late-term abortion on them , say at 1 year old ?
Yes an I am sure you love unbridled capitalism , cruel self centred people do . Capitalism is a cruel system that kills people , lets them starve , makes them homeless , and exploits the poor for the gain of a few .
We do n't take him seriously anymore because despite having been refuted over and over ( both here and on at least four other boards ) , he still posts the same garbage . Whenever it looks like there has been overwhelming refutation of his thread , he abandons it and starts a new one saying basically the same thing as the one before it . THAT is why he is n't taken seriously , and no , it is not `` unfair '' . I also have to ask why you think he puts so much intelligence into his posts , when all he does is either cut and paste from some anti-evolution site , or say things like `` science is a joke '' My pet dog could do better .
And being an evil old darwinist I should add < smirk > .
It 's a consideration , but I doubt we should be promoting this under the `` population control '' banner . All these figures are really telling us is that society needs further education when it comes to contraception . I do n't see how anyone could advocate an invasive surgical procedure as anything else but a last resort method .
You mean like Darwin 's 'survival of the fittest ' tautology ?
Just being persnickety here ... she wrote an opinion piece
the problem with a `` un-genesis style '' creation is that it would effectively nullify everything in the bible . the biblical god both created life on earth in 6 days and sent his son to die for the sins of humankind . to me there is something very wrong with blatantly rejecting one biblical claim and blindly embracing another the god in this context ( one that created the world some other way , and may not necessarily disapprove gays ) may also not care about your ethical code . then such a god 's existence should have no bearing on how we live our lives , now would it ? if such a god requires us to be ethical , is not against homosexuality , and created the world in a way other than genesis ' description , then you are talking about a god of specific characteristics that would lend itself to a precise definition . we would require a lengthy list of rules by which we should live , and a description of how the world was actually created , as well as historical references of god 's interaction with mankind in times past . you 'd end up with another bible
personally I do n't accept the premise of the question .

Save 95 % of fetuses ? Pro-lifers have a weird obsession with non-sentient fetal tissue .
Your right , logic does not change because mans thinking is flawed that because logic is not a human construct . If is was , logic would change at the whem of our thinking .
I dunno ... we already have enough fundies thinking that the Big Bang is part of evolution ...
That 's not quite right . More accurate would be : Nothing that occurs outside the realm of physical law is in the realm of science . Science by no means precludes the possibility of there being something outside the realm of science .
Even Joe the plumber abandoned the garbage scow ? Say it aint so !
I see . Then you are attempting to define evolution out of existance . By your definition ( not that of evolutionary biologists ) evolution requires an increase in information . An unsupported creationist argument . Define information in a meaningful way . Please apply your definition to genetics and show why all genetic changes are a decrease in information .
Standard 2LOT argument ? Find some evidence that is n't just hypotheses .
Ah , speaking of Misnamed institutions ...
This is a push to promote lawlessness . The San Francisco fiasco is the prime example . People with certain agendas are refusing to follow the laws . This is a devastating precedent for our Nation .
Sounds like a fact which has been blown out of all proportion - possibly by the pro-gun side attempting to ridicule it . It is a fact , however , that the presence of a gun can increase aggression levels in individuals . See other times I have brought this up , here ( to the end of the thread ) and here ( again , that post till the end of the thread ) .
Its odd that you would use that concept at all . Do you really think terms used to describe power structures in human organizations are applicable to cells and their subsystems ? Genes are the heritable information store of cells , they perform their function , other subsystems perform other functions . The whole constitutes a living cell . The whole who is on top thing is an inapplicable concept . What counts is understanding the functions of the various subsystems . A cell is not a dominance heiracrchy .
CO2 is only a part . Do n't forget the methane that termites produce .
I do not understand why people are stuck in this mindset that we have to define ALL abortions as either right or wrong . In between , there is the option of calling abortion under certain circumstances as right or wrong or calling abortion in certain trimesters as right or wrong . Why limit yourself to the extreme views ? I do not believe that the original post asked for an absolute answer , just a survey of opinions . After all , as you say , abortion is not math and there is no one answer that everyone might agree with . However , the question of people 's opinions on the beginning of personhood and how it relates to the morality of abortion lies at the very core of the debate on abortion rights . Really ... what other question is more relevant ?
Perhaps it was an allegorical/metaphorical reference to abiogenesis that creationists just have n't understood .
Actually , we have museums full of evidence . Only a fool talks about scientific proof . On the other hand , we would n't need any box for the evidence of creation or ID that you think is OK to teach as science . It does n't exist .
Well , the now late Dr Crick can have all the odd ideas he wants , but unless it is backed up by evidence , it is n't science . Yes , naturalism is a presupposition . On the other hand , it works . It makes predictions and it lets us do such things as make the very computer you are using . What kind of verifiable and repeatable predictions supernaturalism makes ? ?
That 's enough appeals to authority for one post .
ToE is a mechanistic theory -- it says life is like a machine . Machines are n't intelligent , they just do what they 're made/programmed to do . Darwinists say lifeforms do what they do because of the way their particular genes program them . This is basic stuff ... ..yet you come along and say this is n't so . So which is it ? Is life intelligent or not ? If it is intelligent , what is illogical about believing life was designed intelligently by an intelligent designer ? The intelligence had to come from somewhere . Where did the information in the DNA code come from ?
They rarely date fossils anymore ... instead they look at the strata of earth the bones were found in .
Man has changed significantly in the past few thousand years . I see you opted out of history classes and took it upon yourself to make up your own version .
So , none of those women who slept with men were pregnant at the time ?
But I thought it was an epidemic , more cops killed than civilians ?
Well , first , I did say `` The fact that you and I can not understand this does n't make it impossible . '' Secondly , how is no god possible ? Third , a person being 100 % something and 100 % something else is n't entirely impossible . There are people all over the world who change from 100 % idiotic to 100 % non-idiotic all the time . Lastly , there are many things we do n't understand ... so what 's your point in restating what I said ?
Well then simple Simone , meet H.R . 2401 : Read The Bill : H.R . 2401 - GovTrack.us Specifies right in there , adding the no fly list to the NICS background check database . If your name appears on the government 's secret list , which is over one million names in size , your rights are denied for life and that 's it . And we 've seen how a single name could be shared by several thousand people in the country . Even children are on the no fly list , children who were n't even born when September 11th went down . You wan na try your claim again ?
But first , you have to believe ( on faith - no evidence ) that you know what god said . And then you have to interpret that so that it is acceptable to you . Most people who use your same `` word of god '' believe all of it but understand what it says differently .
Karl asked him to calculate the length of a day 1 billion years ago . It seems that he needs some help . A geologist came up with the following numbers from a survey of geology and astronomy texts . Most of these numbers are derived from daily growth rings in coral ( bet Freeofthought did n't know there was such a thing ) and similar information from brachiopods , bryozoans and pelecypods , and the like .
Well if your claim is that you should n't push a gun owner 's buttons and make them mad , then why are you arguing with me when that 's what you 're claiming is the wrong thing to do ?
I believe such amendments can not be pushed retroactively for them , so their marriages will stand ( Something with US contitution code not allowing things like that to be retroactive ) .
Yes & # 8211 ; same , same .
Kinda ironic , do n't you think ?
Well if the theater has the right to have patrons forcibly removed by the police for doing something they do n't like , then they should be required to post signs at their entrances , listing practices that they wo n't tolerate you doing while on their property .
Again I have to correct you . Dark moths were not observed before 1848 . Similar mutations have been observed in other species of moths both in Europe and in the United States . Merely claiming that there was no change is ducking the question . You did n't bother to inform yourself of the facts and now you return to your incorrect assertion again and again after having been informed of your error .
Bingo . Relationships between appendices of closely related species still suggest that the appendix used to have a different function , namely digestion of roughage . Linky . ( Plus what Otto said , again . )
Because Satan is a fallen angel . He had a chance to be with God , but he did n't take it . He could go back to God any time he wanted to , but he does n't want to . He has free will . God wo n't take that away , even though He can .
So you do n't believe in a democracy ? What if a group of people that have been sexually assaulted get together and try to force their beliefs of stricter punishments on the group of people that sexually assault others . Should this not be allowed to happen in by a vote in a democracy ? So to answer your Muslim question , if done by a vote , then why not ? If you impose 0 beliefs on people you have no laws .
If you were not lying you 'd have a argument . Rhodesian Man is dated between 200,000 and 125,000 years . Your other dates are off as well .
On the contrary , the Pro-lifers are acting like the slave traders . Anyone who denies a human being a fundamental human right because of a physical feature is more like the slave traders than everything . Let me also remind you that black people were sentient . Fetuses are not .
But totally unrequired and unnecessary . Whether it is a witness at a trial or a deposition , member of a jury or a grand jury , use of the Bible and even the words , `` ... so help me God . '' are not required . Any person may refuse the Bible and the words and instead opt to make an affirmation . All that is necessary is to inform the judge that you prefer to do so . Everyone else may take the oath and then anyone who desires makes an affirmation . In the affirmation there is no `` swearing , '' merely a promise . The affirmation carries the same expectations and penalties as the oath . A friend did so in a court once . He did n't know what kind of reaction from the attorneys and judge to expect . He got no reaction whatsoever . The clerk just put down the Bible and administered the affirmation . This is from Article II , Section 1 of the Constitution , regarding the President :
But stress a child , it would be wrong to judge a child by the circumstances of its birth but as a developing embryo I do not think it can be treated the same way . Adoption may be preferable if possible but if someone is causing harm , albeit even unintentionally they are still responsible . The whole idea of manslaughter is based around this , without even going on to criminals being a product of their environment - they may have had apparently little choice in their crimes . This does not exempt them from punishment though - they serve to prevent future crimes or to stop the contining harm being caused .
Hi Phyllis , excuse my confusion , The last thing I want to do is marginalize or antagonize an ally . One piece of advice though , in case you 're not aware of it ; at the top right corner of each post you want to quote is a permalink . If you copy that and past it to the post , the intended post will appear when clicked on . What you have done is posted complete threads which must be waded through to find the intended post . And depending on the thread and poster , determining that might be difficult or impossible . Just so you know for future reference .
Hmmm ... . your religious predecessors would have sentenced you to house arrest for something so heretical .
And of course , that does n't mean that you should be allowed to legislate our right into the ground purely on the excuse of `` public safety '' . There 's a lot of threats to public safety , but they 're fully allowed because they 're deemed as vital or necessary . So do n't go using the argument in support of gun control and gun bans , because it wo n't hold water .
No , its not . Thats a strawman . I have never stated anything of the sort . You just can not debate honestly . I never said that since one argument is wrong , that all are wrong . I am saying that I can prove all the arguments wrong independantly . Not that I have to . Now , any of you able to give even a hint of an intelligent answer to the OP ? Or does that shatter your delusion that you dont support murdering children ?
Hey , laws are just laws , they can be overturned by any activist judge . So what is there about marriage which is absolute ? If nothing , then anyone can marry anyone or anything , its just the whim of a judge which decides . That is where we are heading , and heading fast . These laws stop them for now . But even five years ago , no one would have believed that same-sex marriage could be legislated over the objections of the voters . The gay lobby argues that all love should be celebrated and marriage allowed , tradition notwithstanding . So , the next logical step is that a group of people are being discriminated against , or a human/pet couple is being discriminated against , and the rot spreads .
And how does that mean evolution is wrong and creation is correct ? You do realize that even if you somehow manage to prove evolution false ( not likely ) , you are still miles from proving creation right ?
You mean that you rely on the talking points as laid out by Talk Origins as your bible , as I rely on Gods word to guide my beliefs ? That fact goes without saying . But remember this ian , just because your side is capable of creating lies in order to refute reality , it does n't make anything you say true in any way , shape or form . But thanks for revealing that you do n't mind letting that site do your thinking for you .
`` What is true , Ricker says , is that gun manufacturers have long known that distributors and retailers supply thousands of guns each year to criminals , and yet gun makers deliberately look the other way. `` The quote says it all . That attitude breaks many cornerstone laws regarding personal responsibility . Manufactures are NOT responsible for customers illegal activity . GM and Ford know that 100 % of all the product they sell will be used illegally . Everyone of their cars will be used to break speed limits . No one obeys speed limts , the only time speed limits are obeyed is when a cop is watching . Yet GM and Ford are not responsible for all the illegal activity of their products . Shifting the responsbility for enforcement breaks many traditions and laws regarding individual personal responsibility . When a customer breaks a law using a product , manufactures are not responsible , that goes for both guns and cars , or any product that is sold and used for criminal purposes . There certainly a lack of cooperation between the ATF and the NRA . They really should be working together . It takes two sides to make a conflict . The ATF is trying to single out gun manufactures to be responsible for policing customers . NO OTHER INDUSTRY is being held accountable like that . That is why there is a conflict between the NRA and ATF . The NRA asks that gun manufactures to be treated with the same consideration of existing laws and standards applied to other industries . The NRA supports any efforts to take firearms away from criminals , but they are asking that gun manufactures not be held accountable for customer illegal activity . Which is the position of every single product manufacturer not matter what you make and sell . It is not that gun manufactures are looking away , they do . So does every other manufacture who makes any other product .
But does n't the walking fish still exist ? Here 's a photo and an article of the Walking Fish , also known as the Snakehead . It 's becoming a real nuisance in this Country since its natural habitat is in Asia . http : //www.city.arao.kumamoto.jp/sis ... e/mutugoro.jpg http : //news.nationalgeographic.com/n ... snakehead.html So how is that evidence of evolution at all ? It breathes air , walks on land and still survives and thrives in the water in the modern world . Exactly what evolved from it again ?
Those who care enough to read the above and understand what the authors have studied will hardly jump on the bandwagon and declare that Genes are Dead .
Good news for the Second Amendment : Wicker Amendment Passes Overwhelmingly
The fact you always ignore is your not just doing it to your body ... ..
Like , how many shooting in Germany ? Like , what 's the ratio of shootings to population in the two nations of Germany and the U.S ?
Can you show me the stats for this , are we dealing with 2003/4 numbers compared to before the ban , or the year after ? Biggest problem we have with guns is actually modified starting pistols rather than smuggled guns , our gangs not quite measure up to yours , despite what many of them would like to think
HOW we transitioned is by mutation and natural selection . The ability to walk upright gave us a better overview of the area , giving us more time to react if there was a predator around . It also freed up our hands , and we slowly began using tools more and more . As for WHEN this happened , I give you : Australopithecus afarensis
This quote also shows that the supposed `` friends '' were women who lived in the same complex as the woman , not necessarily anything more than neighbors . Flynt also tried to get the media to pick up his story but instead they insisted as told by Ward :
It is n't a person because it does n't have a higher brain necessary for a mind to form in .
Thanks ... . I was too lazy to look it up ... .
oh , must have missed it . Obviously I would n't have done that on purpose . what 's the name of the thread ?
No they 're not ... .do zoos document the changes in phenotype that no-doubt occur ? This is not the zoo 's job -- their job is not experimentation on animals -- that 's science 's job . Besides that , zoos do their darndest to house the animals in habitats that mimic the animals ' natural settings . SS : 2 ) Show me one instance of science testing/disproving lamarckian-style inheritance .
False . This is not a valid definition of atheism . Atheism is the lack of theism ( the belief in gods ) . Certainly , if I said `` there is n't a tiger in my bathroom '' , I would n't need to have a camera in there to see . It 's called being reasonable .
No I should n't be fighting against abiogenesis , I 'm for unrestricted freedom to explore it all !
Yeah , see this is the old `` gateway drug '' fallacy . If anything is a gateway drug , it 's alcohol , so why is it still legal ? If a drug can act as a `` gateway '' to other drugs , is n't that why it 's illegal ? So are people sitting around drinking alcohol all day , waiting for someone to come by with something `` harder '' ? No , and the same is true for people who smoke pot . Oh , sure they may also do other things once and a while , but it was n't simply because they tried that first joint . It 's just a personality trait and a common one . If pot did n't exist , these people would be doing something else . The same with alcohol and cigarettes . If they did n't exist , people would find some other type of vice .
I 'm saying that if we assume reports that do n't fit with science are n't true , then we ca n't use the filtered evidence to prove science is always true . Just like if I rejected as impossible any reports of Christians killing people and then said 'therefore Christians do n't kill people ' . The conclusion is made certain by the methodology .
Then for you , you made the right decision at the time . I 'd personally have been leary of not getting to work or go to school easily from the doctors statements , especially in regards to keeping the child .
Well that was a good start . Are you planning on insulting everyone who replies to your post ? Of course it would be more difficult for criminals to get hold of guns if there were fewer of them around . It would also make it more difficult for children to get hold of them , or feuding neighbours who , on the spur of the moment , think that waving a gun around might bring about a solution to their problems . If you do n't think you 're going to like the answers to your question , then do n't ask the question . Smiley
Well , if some of the implications of quantum theory are correct ( and do n't quote me on this ) , then some of those things are actually possible . However , as any scientist worth his/her salt will tell you , just because something is possible does n't mean it 's definite . I do n't see any proof of those things happening any time soon , either , but they 're fun to think about , are n't they ?
Bet the crime rate skyrockets , but I wonder what happens if you ( officers ) just put a bullet in them , you know for resisting arrest ? Who does that pinhead mayor remind you of ?
Nope . And since the melanic form is the dominant allele , your point is moot .
Typical YEC misrepresentation . Professor Olsen has no qualms with the concept of evolution- what he does not see is the link between birds and certain theropods . If you think he does not think evolution is correct I suggest you send him an email asking for his views . Here is his address : olsons @ si.edu Off course , you might be trying to infer that because their are differences of opinion in the field of evolution makes the whole notion irrelevant . I disagree , but if you insist we will examine differences in opinion between different groups within , lets see ... ... ... how about Christianity ? Do they make the whole religion completely rejectable ?
That is what supersport is hoping to do ... However , assuming that you are correct in your interpretation , he has no chance of doing it so well .
No I am saying a human being . Human is VERY diffent from human being . The hair that is in the drain of my shower is `` human . '' It has the DNA charicteristics that make me and it human . My arm is human . It also has human characteristics . The question is , is it a `` human being '' with rights and interests , that was my point .
What ? How did you get that analysis from that scripture ? We DO hang on something . It 's called the gravity of the Sun , and other planets .
So theistic evolution is not a belief , not a faith at all ? It is simply a humanistic idea that is based on science , using God to fill gaps ?
The civil rights violators claim they want to keep guns out of the wrong hands , when the truth of the matter is you and I `` have the wrong hands ''
And it was not the 9th Amendment that the court has used to accomplish this . Rather , it is the 14th through various illegitimate legal doctrines such as incorporation and substantive due process .
Probably true .
Because one is n't a belief .
In your analogy I would say they are confusing too . I do n't smoke however it is not because I am against smoking it is because I do n't wan na do it eventhough I do n't think it is `` wrong '' . This is a far cry from saying you think something is wrong yet support others doing it if they want to .
Yes . Little .
Yes , and especially when you consider where our educational system is at . Unlike Michael Moore , I 'm fine if they want use the funds for schools for medical care for everyone , instead . We really should get our priorities straight .
And this ladies and gentleman is the problem : `` SheriG '' and other creationists swallow myths and lies and never question them , for they reject the search for knowledge in favour of the security of mythology . `` 99.9 % '' of learned people around Columbus ' time knew the world was a sphere and had done so for 2,000 years at least ! The idea that people thought the world flat at the time is a myth . Try : http : //nabataea.net/flatearth.html http : //www.bede.org.uk/flatearth.htm http : //www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c034.html They are from a variety of sources , even including a creationist one at the end . Oh and no surprise that the very first line of that last site is a lie , as that is standard practice of creation websites . `` Evolutionists often falsely accuse creationists of believing in a flat Earth '' is untrue : we simply liken them to flat-Earthers because of the same assinine refusal to accept reality .
They have changed . For example , ancient examples of coelacanth were shallow water species , while the modern coelacanth is a deep marine species ( actually , two or three species ) . And the differences are enough to put them in different families . By the way , ark guy , what do you know about taxonomy ?
Yes , to follow his commandments to love God and to love one another .
So you 're a historian now ?
Because the soundbite `` survival of the fittest '' was coined to explain evolution to the stupid masses .
And this one too ( abeit watered down- having to wear a to church ) Goes to show just when you thought we had gone all progressive there are some people wanting hiding blatant sexism behind the veil of religion . But with regard to your point I agree entirely- the bible is interpreted in different ways , depending on the person .
It 's bad enough that you claim to oppose evolution when you do n't even know what it is , but to correct someone on logic and get it backwards is really silly . If you limit your claims of creation to the simple assertion , `` God did it ! '' without any specifics as to how , then you have answered no questions and explained nothing . Such empty assertions can not be proven wrong . Such an assertion says nothing about the methods used by God , and that is what scientists study . There are lots of scientists , evolutionary biologists among them , who believe in a Creator God . Science is not a matter of proving something right . Scientific theories are explanations of the processes and mechanisms that account for the facts that have been observed . In science , the facts are the observations . The process of science is a process of testing those theories , again and again . The body of scientific knowledge is composed of tested theories that have NOT been shown to be wrong . The more a theory has been tested , the more secure it is , even to the point that it is no longer doubted by those who are informed about the topic . How many physicists do you think there are that doubt the the earth orbits the sun ? Is that a fact ? How many nuclear physicists doubt the existence of atoms or electrons ? Why is it that all creationists seem to be so ignorant of science that they think a theory is some sort of wild guess and that if they are `` proven '' they will grow up to be facts ? Did it ever occur to any of you that you should actually learn about the topic before you try to instruct others ? One thing that is always true of science is that it is predictive - and `` God did it '' offers no predictions . However , if you wish to assert that ancient mythology is a historical record of the events , you have made assertions that can be checked . For example , if you assert that the creation took place about 6 to 10 thousand years ago , then we can predict that nothing in the entire universe can be older than that . But clearly there are . And we have observed events that happened longer ago than that . For example , SN 1987 A was a supernova that was observed in 1987 within 3 hours of the first light reaching earth . It 's distance from earth has been measured by more than one method . It is 170,000 light years away . In other words , SN 1987 A exploded 170,000 years ago . A creationist 's answer is to claim that his god created the light already on its way to earth , complete with the history of an explosion that never happened . Ultimately , creationism falls back on an untestable miracle for which there is no evidence . So if you want to believe in miracles and mythology , great ! But if you wish to argue science , then should n't you at least learn what it is ? If you claim that a theory is wrong should n't you at least know what that theory is ? By the way , I am getting the definition of evolution from memory . I have been using it for many years . It was first stated some 70 or 80 years ago . Anyone who has taken a course in evolutionary biology heard a similar definition the first day of class . Any text on evolutionary biology or that has a chapter on evolution will have a similar definition . It is common knowledge - and that 's why I ask , if you do n't know what evolution is , how do you know that you are opposed to it ?
Really ? Why for heavens sake would they do such a thing ? Whats the motivation ? And why resort to attacks if the data are on your side . You know the old admonition to lawyers about when to argue what do you not ?
I see patterns here . My girlfriend and I have been debating this subject a lot lately . When we first started debating , she did so in `` solid support of creationism '' ( yes Frog I did not write those words by accident ) . She said , and I quote , `` Evolution is bullsh*t '' . Last night , after two or three evenings of this stuff back and forth ( after I resoundingly bested her on every point , basically ) she affirmed that she does believe in evolution and has `` kind of '' always believed in evolution , but that she has many reservations and questions about it . The pattern ? `` Solid support of creationism turns into an admission that evolution is the truth , but with reservations . '' I find that pattern a little bit amusing . Last night , she had abandoned most of her philosophical objections because I made the concession that everyone has to make if they want to make any headway whatsoever with a budding evolutionist who ca n't let go of their religious objections : `` Okay , maybe it had God 's stamp of approval . '' When you say that , you can move on to a real conversation . In this case , she bombarded me with a million questions that I could n't answer . She seemed excited about it , not debating , but asking me about the wonders of biology with a long series of `` ... but what about this '' and `` ... what about that '' type of questions . One thing she keyed on was evolution as it applies to a larger ecosystem . I could n't quite grasp what she was asking because I do n't think she herself was very clear on the question , but to make a long story short , I got the distinct impression that she simply ca n't wholeheartedly accept evolution because she ca n't begin to fathom the complexity of the science behind it . I have told her time and time again : `` Just because you do n't understand something , that does n't make it wrong . '' I see this same pattern here in your words , Frog . You 're talking about wild collisions of atoms and saying that the foundations who donate hundreds of millions of dollars a year to research know less than you do , because they 're wasting their money . You 're making this subject so much bigger and more philosophical than it has to be , Frog . Is evolution by far the best answer we have to the question of the diversity of species ? The answer is yes , overwhelmingly so . Everything else is moot . It belongs elsewhere .
So if you fall in love with your soul mate , you would have no problem adopting or be opposed to someone making you adopt instead of having your own children ?
I am understanding the show will also cover how single payer advocates were not allowed a seat at the discussion table , and how , a year ago today , they were arrested at the Senate Finance Committee hearing for nevertheless speaking out in challenge to Max Baucus . This thread is for discussing the show , so if you do n't plan on seeing it , do n't bother saying something stupid , Archie . Steeve , you do n't even exist . Go back to cooking your daily books , for the health insurance ghouls you work for . It 's good that they 're expanding the safety net , but ultimately , this bill bringing 30 million new customers to the health insurance industry is not what we need . What we need is simple single payer legislation opening up Medicare to all Americans . Health care is a human right .
H.R.45 - Blair Holt 's Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act of 2009
Actually no . You read the article again , and thoroughly this time .
I know , you 're right . However , if you do n't want to do as Shady1 and share your sincere experience , tell me what you think the post-abortion trauma means in the grander scheme of things . Does its widespread existence tell us something about abortion as a practise ?
Agreed , many of the reasons are ridiculous . But to some people , no restriction on gun ownership is unreasonable .
Cahuella , The Crusades ( for the most part ) were a justified reaction to Muslim aggression . If you would like to see a recent discussion of this then go to the `` Compromise '' thread on this forum and see what Simone and I discussed . As to the sperm and egg being a thing very similar to a fertilized egg..I think that may be a bit of a simplification . As to the Church making fair decisions , I believe it does . That 's why it distinguishes an order of morality with degrees of goodness and badness . That 's why a war may be permissable but an abortion is not . Parcum , glad to see you back . I was wondering where you had gone .
Note the word calls ! In several ! Many ! Get it ! This was a terror tactic that their very own Police department REFUSED ! Well . Until it was all over that is ! That is why I asked the hard questions . Is this the kind of protection we hope for when we call our very own police ?
Archangel is right on this one . It 's completely absurd to compare a tumour to a healthy fetus , which has a separate blood system , and in a relatively short space of time will be an independent person . It does no service to the pro-choice lobby to display the sort of attitude that says `` we do n't value human life '' . If you think abortion is an acceptable moral choice then you have to make a case either that the fetus is not human , is not an individual , is not alive , or is in some other way not worthy of respect . Or you have to make a case that ending it 's life is in some way justifiable in spite of these things . I am pro-choice , but only because I do n't believe you can legislate about an issue like this unless there is near unanimity . The suffering and anguish caused by banning abortion is substantial and should not be dismissed , but equally when abortion is legal it should not be seen as a substitute for contraception . How to achieve this is a difficult one , without causing psychological harm to women who feel they must make that choice .
More like the late 1940s . Look up A.C. Braun and Crown Gall . Granted he did not know the details be he did know that bacteria could transfer `` something '' { the TIP } which permantely transformed plant tissues . Later it turned out to be a bacterial plasmid .
Honest question Arch : where is the problem with a potential variance of 10 billion years ? I know this question may appear ridiculous to you but could you take the question in the spirit it was meant ?
Nothing I have stated is incorrect . If I did you would get specific .
Yes . A proper understanding of rights is neccessary to know when you are aggressing against another person . Most children learn about rights intuitively through social interaction , a child take 's another child 's toy `` That 's mine '' , they say , they may fight over it , but they learn that when people lay contrary claims to things , violent conflict is the result . It is useful to refine this intuitive belief system into something consistent , both individually , and in shaping the law of a society . A society in which people work together through trade and friendship will always be more prosperous and safe than one in which rights are systematically ignored and violent conflict is the norm . It is not useful to talk about rights with people who treat them as subjective , based on value judgements , ie `` People have a right to life , because life is more valuable than being able to have an abortion '' , or `` People have a right to have an abortion , because being able to have an abortion is more important than a fetus '' . There is nothing to debate , we may as well go over whether strawberry or chocolate is a better flavour for a milkshake . In a free society we can disagree over what is `` more important '' and make our own choices , but if value judgements are used to determine law , the only possible outcome is the oppression of those with minority values . No argument can be made about value judgements , they do not convince anyone , they do not provide just solutions . Politically , to demand your values be enforced ( by virtue of your political power ) is to demand the rule of force rather than justice . There are only two choices : The rule of law , justice , a free society , built on the moral foundation of individual rights - or the rule of the majority , built on the arbitrary value judgements and preferences of those weilding power .
See above .
Apples and oranges . We 're not demanding that they have abortions either .
Really ? Then why do they experiment on `` antigravity '' devices or the theoretical possibility of `` time-travel '' ?
EHHHHHHHHHHH ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! WRONG ! Wow , you 're even wrong when yoget away from your precious Bible and try to sound scientific . there is no such thing as the `` Canid species '' . You are so bloody wrong it is n't even funny . `` Canid '' ( or rather Canis ) referrs to the GENUS , the WORD FOLLOWING IT referrs to SPECIES . Perhaps you should head back to school and learn some simple biological classification/taxonomic ranking .
Not afraid of anything ... I want them and buy them because I CAN . They all have different uses and history I collect some of them for that reason .
Yes I disagree with that point . The navy , just like the police , ca n't possibly be everywhere that danger might raise its ugly head . Merchant ships ca n't afford a 24/7 navy escort anymore than the average citizen can afford to hire body guards 24/7 . There 's no legitimate reason why merchant ships should be unarmed and unable to address dangers that deliberately come after them .
The evidence shows that reptiles did give rise to birds , but nothing shows monkeys became humans . Monkeys are far to evolved in their own way to give rise to us .
You really think so ? Im flattered , but I think you are wrong .
You 're welcome , and I hope Collin is wrong about you , and you are not a troll .
Well see , `` democracy '' is not a form of government . So you ca n't pledge allegiance to something that 's not government ( a particular form of government ) .
If putting the child up for adoption , this can be covered too . However , you havingto take time out per doctors instructions is something you might not desire as it could affect career opprotunities in certain lines of work .
Oh come on , marc , you ca n't possibly expect me to swallow that one . Religion , which locked up astronomers ? What atheist social policy was geocentrism getting in the way of , hmm ? What makes that farce science 's fault ?
BUT how is it not ... ..I have a committed realtionship , and after 4 years ( longer than most heterosexual relationships ) do n't we deserve the same rights as you , even if ... ..you do n't believe it is moral . We have given our lives to each other . How is that different from your relationship . Is yours better in some way ? ... .NO it is not ... .
I dont ' make anything that I report ... you speak in hyperbole buddy ... but there is cause and effect , as it pertains to human behavior it is purely a law of consequences . I can not believe you 've never heard of cause and effect , and the entropy the 2nd . law of thermodynamics . Entropy is decay ... as it related to human beavior , you can indulge something that is bad for you until you succomb to it effects on you emotionally , mentally or physically ... because those are the areas man has influence ergo , `` mind , body and spirit '' all three can be effect terminally if the situation is bad enough . Please tell me you knew this right ?
You are missing the point of my using the quote . It is not an excuse for any kind of behavior . It is me , telling you , and anyone else who cares to meddle in my private affairs that they are not welcome there and I will not be taking into consideration for one second what any of you think .
Look , marc , I 'm really tired of spelling this out for you . So I 'll do it once more , bookmark this post , and then link you to it every time you pretend to be so terribly persecuted again . Science is incapable of testing the supernatural . Period . By the very mechanism of science -- methodological naturalism -- no conclusions about the supernatural can be drawn . However , when claims of the supernatural overlap into the natural realm , then those claims can be tested . Science tells us that there was no global flood a la Noah , not that there is no God . Now , if you choose to interpret that as a reasonable person and realize that science shows that `` a Noah 's flood-causing God '' does not exist , then kudos . This does not mean that there is no God whatsoever . The error you are making is that you are equating creationism with God . We 've disproved special creation . Handily . So one might say that there 's good evidence that a God represented by a literal interpretation of the Bible does not exist . But that does n't mean that no God exists , or that a Christian God does n't exist . Then again , if you 've pigeonholed God into a constrictive box based on your own understanding , but you insist that God exists , perhaps you should rethink why you felt the need to cram your God into a tiny box . Science can only disprove a God to whom some human attributes a limitation .
If it meets the definition , it can
Nonsense . The Republicans are all voting against this loser bill . And the Republicans did n't want the age 55 buy in because they knew is was going to be another budget buster and redistribution of wealth fiasco . The N.O.W . ( NAGS ) are a bunch of hypocrites anyway . You hardly ever see them stand up for women if it 's a conservative woman under attack . And they support the infanticide of the unborn under the guise of women 's health care , which is something only spiritually-dead imbeciles do . NOW deserves whatever they get .
An omnipotent deity that created something ca n't destroy it ?
Actually many states already allow same-sex couples to adopt . Jaaaman ! GET WITH THE PROGRAM HERE ! WAKE UP ! The American Pediactrics Association has already put out at least one study showing that children suffer NO Ill effects of being raised in same gender parental homes versus opposite gender parental homes . The ONLY people who put undo expectations on children raise in same gender homes are those who simply propagate hate and misinformation . Now you want to talk about negitive effects of not having a mother or a father , try single parent homes where one or the other has LEFT the famial unit ! Those are the kids who really suffer .
An abortion is an abortion . Your emotional use of the word `` euthanasia '' is pointless and irrelevant . Either you object to abortion or you do n't . Do n't play semantics with regard to disability in order to try to catch prochoicers out . It wo n't wash . I support elective abortion up to viability , and after viability health/life of mother and severe abnormality of fetus ( severe abnormality meaning those conditions that are recognised today as being so severe as to require a late term abortion ) . Do n't like it ? ... TOUGH ! And Phyllis ... its a good idea to let prochoicers answer posts for themselves rather than you imposing what you think are our opinions . If you continue to post prochoicers opinions for them , then you might as well just stand in the mirror and argue with yourself .
So there 's no need to be outraged or question a candidate further just on the basis that he represents the lesser-of-two-evils to you ? You 're using the fact Palin is there to avoid needing to take Biden to task for HIS statements . If , hypothetically speaking , Palin was n't there at all and Biden had made the statement alone in a stump speech , you would just leave it at that and not take him to task for his position ? ? ? Frankly , if he 's the candidate you feel best supports gay rights , I would think this statement on his part would be MORE alarming , and all the MORE cause for concern .
But not a legitimate concern in this case . I have never seen anyone show in any way that the Massachusetts court ruled incorrectly or abused their powers in the least . They based their ruling on their state constitution , which is exactly what they 're supposed to do . `` fiat '' is simply a red flag to wave around to scare up some negative emotions .
Nobody should be forced to even have a sonagram . I think that you 'll find reasonable pro-life and pro-abortion people believe that much .
Preganancy should not be used as a punitive measure against women who are sexual . What you think is not reflective of the reality of women and their cicumstances that exist in the world . The reasons to abort are numerous and complicated . Some reasons are more valid than others . But you have no way of knowing that for millions of women , only they can really know . And although there are some youngsters in this forum who negate life experience , it is not to be negated . Ther is a lot to be said for `` walking in a mile in another 's shoes '' . Be careful about your desire to take the life circumstances of a stranger in your hands . Are you ready to be morally cuplable for the damage you could do ?
Yeah , let 's live in our own narcissistic bubble .
How is it you know this to be true ? Please answer this . I think this is the lie that religious people tell each other to help them justify their belief . Here in the US , the most religious area of the country , the so-called bible belt , has the highest rates of unwanted pregnancy .
Well with thinking challenged individuals like slimjim floating around it is no wonder we have a rogue agency with no oversight attacking the honest citizens . See Ruby Ridge and Waco for examples .
Well then . You stand corrected . Now it just remains to be seen if you 'll admit you are wrong . History is n't betting on it .
Here are a couple of sites that might come in handy : http : //www.gayweddingresources.com/ http : //www.rainbowweddingnetwork.com/ http : //www.pridebride.com/gay-lesbia ... e-planners.htm ( although this site is directed mainly towards lesbians , I thought it might come in handy ) http : //www.twogrooms.com/ http : //www.gaynewengland.net/id92.html http : //daemon.co.za/node/view/97 ( this one is fun , it 's all about wedding etiquite and traditional/non-traditional supersticions ... . ) Hope these help ... . CONGRATS ! ! ! Ps . I better get pictures ! ! !
Hahahaha , there could be 100 crazed flat-earth creationists joining with me in asking questions about evolution and astronomy , and it wouldnt be within light years of the panic and scrambling that evolutionists/atheists have been doing for years now concerning ID . This thread is just aimed at watching the dances . Would I be getting the insults Im getting in this thread if they all didnt find this troubling ? At least Im not advocating hauling astronomy to court and getting it thrown out of significant parts of the public realm . Do you think theyre all genuinely mystified that someone would suggest that other branches of science be held to the same criteria that evolutionists have set for ID ? This thread would n't exist without it , a lot of controversy would n't exist without it , the thoughtfulness and usefulness of science has been thrown into confusion just because militant atheists found a branch of it they did n't personally like , and emotionally set criteria for it that they do n't want applied to other branches of it that they do like . Science has been taken over by atheists , and now it 's political . It 's going to stay that way . Atheists should n't complain about it - they caused it .
I know there & # 8217 ; s an explanation for everything , that & # 8217 ; s why God isn & # 8217 ; t praised as much as He should be . I tend to thank Him for all things . It & # 8217 ; s a habit of mine . I just thought that I & # 8217 ; d throw in my 2 cents worth . No harm intended .
Heres a question ; which one split from the other ? Which one is the new being ? None of them are . If I get a cake and slice into two exact pieces , which one is the new slice ? They are both equally new .
Even Darwin objected to the use of the phrase `` survival of the fittest '' in refering to his theories . He never used the phrase before the 4th edition of `` Origin '' and then he never used it without also making a reference to natural selection .
But you are ok with a woman deciding what is right for someone else 's own body ... specifically the babies ? Seems to me a woman is n't more qualified to deal with the issue of abortion than a man . In fact , it could be said that the man has the only independent perspective .
For you ?
Your knowledge of history is frightening . We saw how well Sarbane-Oxley , the most far-reaching intrusion into corporate America since FDR , prevented our recent crash . A crash that was precipitated by Clintons edict to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to loosen up the purse strings so deadbeats could get mortgages .
I did n't know that doctors have the constitutional right to perform abortions . What provision in the Constitution guarantees that right ?
Yes , I certainly did consider these risks , and the risks at the time were far higher for continuing pregnancy than getting an abortion .
Symbiote seems to have had a large hair across his butt .
Well , I would not make the claim that anyone is just like anyone else , but I would make the claim that gay people are just as likely to be good people as anyone else . Now , I would wager that I know far more gay people than you do . I wager this only because I am in a variety of gay rights organizations , as well as other gay-friendly organizations . I also have many gay friends outside of these organizations . I know of none being sexually promiscuous , though perhaps some are doing it behind my back . I know of many who do believe that sex is for pleasure , but an equal , if not greater percentage of heterosexuals who also believe sex should be used for pleasure . Further , I know a number of very promiscuous heterosexuals . Yet we let those heterosexuals marry . In truth , I see no reason not to . Lots of people of all sexual orientations believe that sex should be used for pleasure , not just children . This fact is a religious / moral belief , and it does not make these people bad parents , nor does it make these people bad people , nor does it make these people less in need of the benefits of marriage should they decide to start a family . If we are going to give marriage to some people , it is inexcusable to deny that marriage to others who are in equal need of it . If you would like others to respect your status as a husband ( or wife , or whatever you would prefer that I refer to you as ) , then you must be willing to respect the marriage of others in return .
If you read this as if he is talking sarcastically it is quite funny . good argument against himself . What he is suggesting is hilarious ... just thinking about three ( or whatever ) amount of people collecting all the non-flood-live-able species in the world and putting them on a vessel is very immaginative and quite frankly impossible ... as I 've said before , get real .
Evolution was n't introduced until 1859 . When did abortion become popular ? The industrial revolution occurred in the 1800s . Maybe that was the cause of abortion 's alleged popularity . Grover Cleveland was elected in the 1800s . Clearly he had something to do with the alleged increase in abortion 's popularity . The American Civil War occurred in the 1800s . It must have been the impetus for the rise in popularity of abortion . A human embryo does have features that look like gill slits . They are not gills but pharyngeal clefts . No modern book presents any information that human embryros have gill slits as if it is fact .
So that no girl , underage or otherwise , refuses to seek treatment for fear of what their parents will think or say . If a girl can not be tested for a STD without parental notification and she does not wish her parents to know she had sex ( or fears their wrath ) , she may not go in for testing . In general , knowing whether you have a STD is a good thing .
Oh OK , I get it ! Its not being gay that is a sin ; its the gay sex that is a sin . You are such an expert on gay people ! How about this EZ , what if two gay men live together , love each other , sleep in separate beds , never have sex but maybe give each other a little French kiss now and then ? Is that OK , EZ ? Here let me answer that question for you since your famous for avoiding the issue . Why yes Mr. Monster that is perfectly fine and a totally realistic thing to ask people to do ! I know why youre avoiding answering the topic question directly . Believe me I am going to rip you a new one regardless ( figuratively speaking . ) You may as well let it all out . You know you want to . So go ahead , make my day .
Homo-erectus and Neandertals had different bone structures . How could they be fully human when their anatomy is fundementally different ?
This essay is so amazingly full of amazingly large holes that a systematic debunking of it requires alot of time and effort . However , I 'm sure someone here would like to take a crack at it . Alternatively you could just see that it 's not worth it , and leave it alone . Even I , a high school student , can successfully debunk this .
Well , there 's a little more to it since the courts ruled that abortions have to be carried out in the first trimester when the fetus is much less developed than one that could survive outside the womb ( or `` room '' if you prefer ) .
If this thread is intended to be read only by those with a technical expertise in logical analysis , then my low-tech approach will make you groan . However , I 'm still puzzled by the idea that `` logical necessity must exist in every reality '' when this idea is applied to a particular problem . I can see that interior to logical reasoning , `` necessity '' must exist in every reality - otherwise what we understand as `` logic '' would not be that but something else . To simplify : All my friends are Irish Sheila is my friend So Sheila is Irish . ( The same sort of logical necessity applies ( I think ) to propositions involving mathematics : 6+2 = 8 can not be refuted because 6+2 is just another way of writing 8 . ) As Sheila exists in the real world , the information about her contained in the syllogism also happens to be factually true . But the necessary truths of logic including the proposition that God exists , are deduced from applying the rules of logic and are not necessarily factual truths and seem to have the same status as Sheila would if she existed only as an idea .
Yeah , but Herod is n't a demon : he 's a human king .
You have `` shown '' no such thing to be true . You have asserted , without evidence and without study .
You gave a list here . What is your reasoning for believing they are true ? Because it makes sense to you ? Well mine makes sense to me . Why is it that when I state mine comes from an outside source it is unreasoned but when yours is somewhat developed from outside sources it is not ? In the end , you have a moral code developed by you whether influenced by the outside or not . It therefore puts faith in yourself and lends itself to be compromised . I can even relate this to the accounting world We have something called segregation of duties . It basically is used so you have more accountability . In my case , I have a moral code outside of my control . I have to be accountable to that . In your case you are only accountable to yourself and thus it is fairly easy to change the moral code to suit some self desires . This is a bit of a tangent so lets move on The main point is , your code still works on some level of blind faith as you claim mine does . I freely admit mine is blind faith and I only wish others would admit to theirs as well . Just think of it as you ca n't prove anything you can only assume certain things and make calls based upon those very basic assumptions .
So you have said .
Well , where do you get your beliefs about right and wrong from ? I mean , I know that you have moral standards and are most likely an ethical person . Sandycane does have a point in her previous message to you . It is just that I think that the main point was that you have no basis for believing what you believe to be true about morals and ethics because you have no one who tells you what is right and wrong , you must choose them and put them into practice for yourself . You have what I call `` relative morality '' . This is where people decide for themselves what is `` right '' and what is `` wrong '' . However , Chirstians believe that there is what I call an `` absolute morality '' . This absolute morality comes from our Creator God who sets the rules and morals that govern all people . I had a small debate about this with the bootfitter in another section on abortion . I do n't think that Sandycane was not pointing out that you have no morals , they just are n't absolute , i.e . you get to choose them for yourself . You may indeed have exactly the same morals and values that I have , but you still have `` relative morality '' as you have choosen those yourself . I have the `` absolute morality '' as I believe and try to put into action what God has revealed through His Word , the Bible , e.g . love your enemies . I will admit it , I do n't always succeed , but I do my best .
So the initial murder was n't enough to show `` that they are willing to commit acts of violence '' ? This makes absolutely no sense .
ZERO . I do n't think he # # # # ed one African . Unless you can demonstrate otherwise , your statement is false .
I apologise if I have offended you Jason . Furthermore I must admit that I do not actually own a camel .
So let 's look at the facts . In the UK there 's a continual fear of the people being armed , so pervasive and paralyzing in nature , that it extends even to the police being armed . You fear your own neighbors , you fear your own police officers . You insist that absolutely nobody can be trusted without extensive background checks and letters of reference of character , and even then you still do n't trust people . And yet you claim that this society of fear , this overwhelming distrust of absolutely everyone , is somehow the better society , the safer society . You want us to believe that fearing your own shadow is the kind of society that we in America should strive to become . No thanks .
Obviously , because we were actively suppressing it because it disproves evolution . That is what you want to think , right ? Decades ? When was it even discovered , dipsy doodle ? It was not recognized until 1984 . Since then , there have been 12,600 papers published on the subject , and that is just counting those with the exact phrase `` horizontal gene transfer '' in the title or text . Do you really consider that ignoring something ?
It is very simple . Creationism is not a valid scientific theory . It can not be , and has never been , demonstrated that Creationism or ID are valid scientific theories . Therefore Creationism and ID should not be taught in science class . Evolution has been shown to be a valid scientific theory through research and experimentation over a century . It should be taught in science classes . That is the only issue . Should any idea , whether or not it is a valid scientific theory , be taught in a science class .
So as a conservative ... you believe in having someone else decide for you what kind of sex you can have in the privacy of your home ? Wow , maybe I 'm not conservative after all . Some Jews think pork is disgusting ... would you support them banning you from eating pork ? I 'm not saying you ca n't think what you want about whatever you want ( I personally think drinking blood and eating dead flesh is creepy but would never attempt to enjoin a christian from doing so ) ... but you cross the line when you attempt to deny someone liberty when it does n't effect you .
A belief in Adam and Eve is a fundamental necessity to being a Christian at all . Jesus Christ believed in Adam and Eve , after all He created them . Gen 5:2 Male and female created he them ; and blessed them , and called their name Adam , in the day when they were created . [ Adam means man ] These arevthe words of Jesus Christ . You will notice He refers to the Old Testement as History . Mat 19:4 And he answered and said unto them , Have ye not read , that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female , Mat 19:5 And said , For this cause shall a man leave father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife : and they twain shall be one flesh ? Mat 19:6 Wherefore they are no more twain , but one flesh . What therefore God hath joined together , let not man put asunder . Mat 19:7 They say unto him , Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement , and to put her away ? Mat 19:8 He saith unto them , Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives : but from the beginning it was not so . Joh 1:1 In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God . Joh 1:2 The same was in the beginning with God . Joh 1:3 All things were made by him ; and without him was not any thing made that was made . Joh 1:4 In him was life ; and the life was the light of men . Joh 1:5 And the light shineth in darkness ; and the darkness comprehended it not . Joh 1:6 There was a man sent from God , whose name was John . Joh 1:7 The same came for a witness , to bear witness of the Light , that all men through him might believe . Joh 1:8 He was not that Light , but was sent to bear witness of that Light . Joh 1:9 That was the true Light , which lighteth every man that cometh into the world . Joh 1:10 He was in the world , and the world was made by him , and the world knew him not . Hitler said it was necessary to attack America because the best aryan stock had already moved here and would evolve into the master race .
I think it is worthy of consideration that the first state to enact OGAM legislation 30+ years ago , ( South Carolina ) rescinded the law in 2004 because no positive benefit was being realized .
Well that is a good question , but were just kinda what ifing heres all.http : //www.4forums.com/political/ima ... lies/xkill.gif
Really ? This is ground breaking stuff , from which journal did you obtain this paradigm shifting piece of info ? Plates moving at indy 500 speeds would overturn our understanding of the planet . Pity you think so little of the physical sciences . They can save your life .
# 1 See the post titled `` Biblical Failures '' in the Religion section of this forum . If the Bible has a single inaccuracy in it , then it can not be considered 100 % true . This post shows inaccuracies so the Bible can not be considered a reliable source for things that can not be proven and that includes trying to say whether an unborn baby has a soul . Besides , why should you be able to force your beliefs on everyone else ? Perhaps you could justify a law that says all Christians can not have abortions . # 2 A child who is unborn is not being punished by having its life ended . Even if you believe in the Bible , the child is going to simply ascend to heaven without having to suffer here on earth . If you do believe in the Bible and do n't believe this above fact , then you are saying that God will punish the child for being aborted . # 3 Your moronic statement about how there would be no laws without religion discredits your writings anyways . Laws do not stem from religion . They stem from the need for a society to be able to function properly . They stem from mans desire for power . Some do stem from religion but this does not make up the majority . If you wish to try and debate this , why not explain how religious influenced the laws concerning driving on a specific side of the road more than social influences did . # 4 Getting back to the abortion debate , what do you have against abortions ? Assuming you can not simply get off by saying the Bible says this or religion says that , what else can you say ? The fact is that abortion does not affect you . You can preach about abortion being bad and even protest it , but why should you try and force your beliefs on others ? I know this is the essence of Christianity , but why should it extend to society ? Pro-choice at least lets people decide what is best from them and the child . Can you honestly say it is better for a child to be born and mistreated and/or under fed until it dies than it is for a child to simply be aborted ?
All these quotes from the bible are wher God has either killed children or sanctioned the killing of children and pregnant women . So to say that Giod does n't want abortion is strange when He has killed children by the thousands .
Well , you have me there . I did n't do a statistical analysis , but I 'm not a statistician either and could n't perform an analysis even if there was enough data . However , if such an occurrence were probable , you 'd think that scientists would have an easy time of producing the evidence .
And we will get to that , but I 'd really like to keep this discussion on track . That 'll have to do for now , it 's 2:30am and I have work tomorrow .
Yes , but if seen from space ( something the ancients could n't do ) it LOOKS like it hangs on nothing . Do n't worry , I do n't mind spelling it out for you .
Only those parts of the world that are ignorant and do not bother to do their research . Those who DO research recognize that even with the changes , there was still no ID being taught in our classrooms , and we still had stricter definitions of `` science '' and stricter curriculum than 38 other states . Personally , I do n't CARE which way they go with this . They just need to pick one and stick with it . The changes DO NO effect curriculum at the classroom level , and DO NOT allow for any alternate theories ( if you want to call `` god dunnit '' a theory ) to be taught . The whole thing has just been an expensive peeing contest between 2 sets of XXXXXX that has drawn the attention of a bunch of other XXXXXX who fail to recognize that it means NOTHING . It is essentially a philosophical argument without meaning or merit . Kansas has some of the best schools in the nations . We are in the top 5 . This IDIOCY never should have been allowed to pollute our educational system , and it CERTAINLY should not have been re-introduced 4 times . The stupidity is simply mind boggling .
Another unfounded assertion .
While 'commonly ' may or may not be true , this does end up happening at least some of the time ( and possibly a lot of the time ) . It 's highly doubtful that clinic workers do this with ill-intent ... for example , a woman enters a clinic because she 's confused and thinking about getting an abortion ... she wants to consider the option of abortion , though she 's not really comfortable with the idea . The clinic worker assures the woman that abortion is a painless procedure , and that lasting psychological effects rarely ( if ever ) occur . The clinic worker may ask the woman to think about how having a child would interfere with the woman 's life . I 'd encourage you to read the book `` Forbidden Grief '' by Theresa Burke . It is a fascinating look at real women who have had abortions , and the experiences they have gone through . Some of the women described in the book feel that they were manipulated by clinic workers into having an abortion . ( In reality , short of physical force , no one can 'force ' you to do something you do n't want to do , but things can be said and done to mislead a person -- intentionally or otherwise -- into thinking that 's what they want themselves . )
Why do you assume your mythology has any weight on me ? Can you give me any scientific evidence Adam And eve existed ? Can you back up your statement about `` God creating everything ? `` .
Dino blood for instance . Never mind that soft tissue was misreported . And if we look at the fluid mechanics thread , you are trying to jump on the issue that the failure to provide 100 % certainty of expected layers makes TOE wrong yet you provide no evidence of your beliefs . But as Kronus said , `` It 's not like any evidence has ever been presented , so how can we say ? ''
Give a link to your objection and I 'll take a look and get to responding when I have more time .
PH , is this wher you got your rabid `` UN hates guns '' rhetoric ? Lets look at what is being attacked here :
Well yes , that is a truth in this debate . I wonder if Vek would add vivid photgraphs of such tragic ends to his gallery ? After all , the position is called pro-life .
Actually , I do n't sneer at you . I laugh at you . And I do n't attack your intelligence but your knowledge . You are intentionally ignorant .
In older times man had more questions without answers than today . Some men believed if a God of fire because they did not understand what fire was . Because of their misunderstanding they invented an answer , the Fire God . Today we know exactly what fire is and we do n't need to invoke some mythical explanation . Today 's atheists know that there are many other questions we do n't have answers for and it 's OK to simply say we do n't know instead of buying into the whole `` let's-invent-some-god-to-explain-it '' mentality ... .
They used to keel over regularly before modern medicine and my wife has been on medication for a thyroid condition ever since she delivered . `` During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , between 1 percent and 1.5 percent of all births ended in the mother 's death as a result of exhaustion , dehydration , infection , hemorrhage , or convulsions . Since the typical mother gave birth to between five and eight children , her lifetime chances of dying in childbirth ran as high as 1 in 8 . This meant that if a woman had eight female friends , it was likely that one might die in childbirth . ''
Really , fetal persons are born . Science has demostrated that birth really occurs into the womb , not when one leaves it .
Well that 's a stupid statement . Stupid enough that I ca n't even wrap my head around it and make a proper comparison .
So when it comes to the matter of Constitutional rights , everybody should just stay back and let the states do whatever they want , however they want ? But when it comes to something like Arizona 's new immigration law , the federal government should step in and overrule them on their decision ? You 're very inconsistent in your logic .
So then you 're alright with an organization that actively hung people from trees and committed murder for the sake of intimidating those that wanted to be able to vote , ride up front on buses , have decent facilities , etc . Nice to know where you stand . White supremacists support gun control .
So the simpler proto-languages had to be learned at an early age , too . So what ?
Fine , it 's not your reasoning . That does n't make the reasoning not defunct though .
Really ? Because I do n't think that 's how most rational people would interpret it . A rational person would look at that video and say `` this proves that all anti-choicers think like a 12 year old '' The proofs in the pudding as they say
A lot of people say that Jesus is the son of God . Others say that Jesus was actually God Himself , who came to Earth . Whichever way is the real case , Jesus did n't need to carry anything , because God had the ability to wipe two cities off the face of the map by raining down fire and brimstone . God has plenty of firepower at His disposal . And He never said `` lay down and die because it 's wrong to protect yourselves from harm . ''
Why then is this not taught in history classes ? Why are we taught AS FACT that Homer wrote them ?
And you can be described as a `` pre-dead corpse '' as well . Histrionic revisionist linguistics only serve to push some form of dishonesty agenda that can not stand by itself on the facts . It is the coward 's route . Are you a coward ? ? ?
`` Belongs there '' is a subjective determination . Also , whether the womb is the fetus ' 'natural environment ' does not negate that it is 'tresspassing ' in the woman 's body ( and one can not say it is n't inside the woman 's body or that the body does n't belong to the woman ) .
One can not have a controled experiment , as one can in the hard sciences . Psychology , anthropology and other disciplines also do not allow for controlled experiments . However , as with these other fields , one can do a detailed analysis of events that do occur to see if there is a common trend . For example , if people claim to see a supernatural event , take them aside separately to question them about the details . If one can be sure that they did n't get a chance to coordinate the details ahead of time and , nevertheless , the details match , then that would be evidence supporting the supernatural . If this happens consistently , then it would start giving strong support to the existence of a supernatural . Unfortunately , though there are occasional events that remain unexplained , we all know that the great majority of events have not resulted in any conclusive evidence of a supernatural and often they are shown to be simply fraudulent or due to psychological misinterpretation . Since so many of these claims about the supernatural have proven to be dead ends , it is understandable that people should automatically be wary of anyone 's claim toward supernatural proof , which has led to the very subject being essentially taboo in intellectual circles . That is unfortunate . If there actually was a supernatural and did manifest itself , then it might never be discovered because any genuine evidence presented would be automatically ignored because of the taboo . The main challenge is to have the patience to weed through the thousands of bogus claims in the hope of finding something genuine - whether or not that hope ever gets fulfilled .
Well no . NS only provides a sorting function and only a partial sorting at that . That which reproduces better survives better than that which does not . Simple as that more or less . There is no `` organization '' involved since organization is again a mental concept not a law of nature .
When contraception failed in my monogamous long term relationship , I heavily researched both options , as well as parenting . I looked into requirements for Medicaid , WIC , and other subsidized assistance offered in my community . I called a few clinics around town . That 's an interesting story , but not for here . I had heart to heart talks to many different people with different viewpoints . I decided to have an abortion because I was sick all the time . I had diagnosed migraine headaches constantly , and my seizure disorder that had laid dormant for years returned . I could n't leave my house . I lost my job . I was in the middle of my education ( it was early summer ) and if I continued my pregnancy it would have put me back a semester , thus costing thousands of dollars . The father did not want me to continue the pregnancy because he was concerned about my physical health . Just thinking about that time period makes me nauseated . I understood the merits of adoption , especially since my father was adopted . I talked to my aunt about adoption and foster care , since she has participated in both . I also thought about parenting , the love and all the things I have to offer . I knew that the father would have supported my decision to parent , I knew that our financial hardships could be dealt with , and I knew that my education could be continued later . I came to the conclusion that abortion was the best choice for me and my health . I appreciate that some may find this decision selfish , and essentially it is , since it was made with my best interests in mind . I would also hope that even if they consider it selfish , they understand the reasons why I made that decision . And if it was your wife , daughter , friend , and she was dealing with what I was , you would not expect her to continue a pregnancy .
The golden rule is not just one sided . It does not expect us to do all giving and no taking . I have expectations of how others should treat me ( the taking part ) but , to be consistent , I should realize that they have expectations of me ( the giving part ) . Though people may want to win out in a job interview over someone more qualified , most do n't morally expect that that should happen since they realize that that expectation would not be fair . They may make a buck off of a person but , unless they are con artists who lie to get that buck , most will do it in a way they consider fair , under laws they themselves would be willing to live under . ( As a side note : Even most con artists might admit that , if they themselves were conned , then they would have deserved it for being suckers . ) The rule of treating others as we would want or expect to be treated does n't necessarily lead to a hugely generous society - just to one that seems to minimize suffering in a realistically achievable way .
Montalban , Montalban ... .you are not reading , or choosing to ignore . Did you miss the basic logic you violate again ?

Why ca n't you answer questions directly ? anyway , I support ct in passing civil unions or marriage lite as I like to see it , but It does n't confer equality . If it is really equ8al than it would be marrige . Reason beinbg portablity ( irealize you think that some day we might have that , but we do n't so far and we can not ccontrol other countries who may have gay marriage but not cilvil unions and may not recognize civil unions but recognize marriage . ) If it is good for straight couples , it should be equally good for all couples . . No one is more superior . Everyone should be equal . Marriage for all is equals .
Actually in terms of populations were the same people as the Irish . If you want tyranny try the oppression of the Native Americans . Did you know that the Natives and the blacks were both on the British side during the War of Independence ? Amazing how we tyrants command such free support huh ... .
There is never a question of `` killing people '' in such circumstances , it a matter of deciding if treatment should be withdrawn and thus allow them to die , i.e . where there is no possibility of any sort of a recovery .
Read the post before this one .
If you are ashamed of what you are doing then there must be something wrong with it ! The only people that disregard laws they oppose are criminals , thus the name criminal ! This is what separates law-abiding citizens from criminals .
You tell me if they were without their tools would they need to have a faith ?
An excellent example of the mechanisms of evolution . Thank you . I do n't know why you keep posting articles that refute your position though .
Agreed that they are still the same species , much like the `` 13 species '' of Darwin 's Finches , and I have no problem with evolution in that respect . I can even see the plausibility of different subspecies evolving eventually into different species if they are geographically separated for a sufficiently long time . But I still do n't see where evolution , in that sense of the term , can account for dozens of species of monkeys occupying the same patch of rainforest , or dozens of species of gazelles occupying the same patch of grassland .
Actually it would be impossible for the monblock to spin . There is NO PLACE OUTSIDE OF IT from which to observe ! Any observer would necessarily be inside the budding universe - no place else to go you see . Indeed its still impossible for us to know whether the universe as a whole is spinning or not ! ! ! ! Sorry I was being a bit ironic thinking you would see the point . Guess not though .
I think your idea has merit . However , before I would fully endorse it , I am interested in how you see it being implemented and administered from the standpoint of equal protection under the law .
Pregnancy involves risk . While opting to undertake risk for a worthwhile objective is fine , to compel someone to take that risk is not . Obviously some pregnancies are undesirable , when unplanned or especially when the result of rape or incest . Besides , something that almost any woman can do is hardly a `` miracle '' . Wondrous maybe but miraculous ?
One could easily say that the heart is when life begins , because the heart is what all living things have . However , wheres the evidence ? There is very little if any . Not to mention , it goes against the principle of biogenesis which says that humans only reproduce humans . They dont reproduce organs ( although that would be sweet ! ) , they dont reproduce cats , they produce humans and only humans . In other words , when humans have a sexual intercourse , the only possible being they can create is a human being . No , they dont create potential humans , because that would mean that the early fetus isnt a human , is it ? One argument I have neglected is the fact that you were a fetus , and you were a zygote . No , you werent a sperm . No you werent an egg . You were , however , a zygote . As far as I know , Ive never heard of humans transforming from an organ to a being .
No . Monkeys are modern animals . Our closest living primate relatives are the chimpanzees . We share a common ancestor with them about 5 to 7 million years ago .
Really ? Show me that by quoting where the article says it .
But you can drink and drive , you just can not be intoxicated over a certain limit and drive . There is no test possible in the field ( like a breathylizer used for alcohol ) that would allow for testing of THC levels . It should be like anything else , if you are causing a problem or showing visible signs of impairment , you get detained and taken for further testing , which they can actually draw a THC level on you in a lab . And since you bring it up , marijuanna does not slow down reaction times near as much as alcohol . Alcohol is far more physically impairing than even high doses of THC .
Where did Vitter lie ? He admitted his wrong doing and apologised to his wife . Had a liberal been accused he would have attacked the leak as a Right Wing attack designed to destroy him with the politics of personal destruction . The double standards are a joke . Out of 10,000 different names she has released , do you really think there are no Democrats on that list ? But ABC has those phone records so they can release a different Republican on the list every month to demonize the Right while never exposing the libs on the list , thereby creating a totally false impression of the real story that people from both sides of the aisle are guilty of indiscretions .
But what would be the minimum for you to survive ? Here I am getting at the essence of self . For example , if you went into a coma with severe brain damage such that your body was alive but you had no mental processes left - no thoughts , emotions , sense of pain , no mental processes whatsoever apart from brain function controlling your body ( heart rate , etc . ) - would `` you '' have survived ? Or would `` you '' essentially be gone at that point ?
Would n't this be the same thing as two people deciding whether or not YOU should die and then telling you that your view is not meaningful ?
So you support the idea of the government forcing or endorsing families that `` raise their children the right way ? '' And who gets to define that right way ?
You mean like the do with abiogenesis theories ?
Did these reputable creationists realize that we can measure continental drift ?
And while were at it , let 's limit education to just high school students , Gay Rights to just gay people , Religion to Roman Catholics , Gun Control to people who own a gun , Sports to Jocks and Fun debates is now limited to people who are not boring . Wow , I 'm not going be able to do too much . I should shut-up while I 'm behind .
I do n't think VoR realizes that we see him gay-bash without a second thought that we recognize his socalled `` coy '' tricks . `` You can fool some of the people some of the time , but ... ... ... ... ''
Because evolution is the main weapon that is used against traditional U.S. morals and customs .
Well could you please explain it again , because I do n't understand what you were saying ? I do n't even understand the current comment . Thanks .
But I have dealt with you before and you reap what you have sown . Suddenly I am to believe that you have changed ?
I know it would against your very nature , but you might want to look up a fact or two before speculating . Only 26 % of Spaniards object to same-sex marriage . Polls show support at between 65 and 70 % . Among the young , it exceeds 80 % .
Actually , no one cares if you believe in god . That is your business since it is something that you take on faith without any evidence that it is true . And no one believes in `` evolutin '' [ sic ] . The theory of evolution is an explanation for observed facts that has been repeatedly tested . It is the best explanation that scientists have been able to formulate . It is based on evidence and not faith .
So they told Galleo , all you have to do is print out our news releases on firearm related boards and we will pay you xxx dollars . Did n't mention ruining any credibility he might have had and I hope he did n't quit his day job . This may look like a big placid lagoon but all the fins are below the surface so they just dive right in..PRICELESS !
So the start of personhood for a particular person is a variable , based on that individuals memory . Twenty years ago I could remember events at my fourth birthday , but today those memories are gone . For a while I had personhood at 4 years of age , but today , looking back , I did not have personhood until I was 6 . As I age and my memory fails , it may turn out that I did not have personhood until I was 21 years old . Personnhood comes and goes . Do I have it right ?
Because Africa is n't one big homogeneous ecosystem . There are jungles , plains , deserts , swamps . Himps living in the jungle were n't in competition with himps that started migrating out onto the plains . Their food sources are different , their territories are different . The more suited to plains-dwelling we became , the less attractive a prospect it was to return to the jungle . Pretty straightforward , really .
Far too simplistic to be called accurate , there is some truth in this .
Again that is a poor analogy . Congress does not have any powers NOT included in the Constitution . Quite the opposite , it specifically says that any powers NOT included in the Constitution is defaulted to the states and Congress is additionally prohibited from taking any more authority NOT named in the Constitution . Since there is no specific naming article saying Congress does not have the power to ban manufacturing weapons , in fact it DOES NOT . According to the 10th Amendment : The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people . Thus you have another poor analogy . Congress DOES NOT have the right to ban manufacture of guns .
Whether the steps of evolution have been observed is unrelated to whether evolution complies with the Scientific Method . The scientific method is used to provide evidence for a hypothesis by perform a study that could disprove that hypothesis . Evolution has passed every scientific test that could disprove it to date .
Personally I wo n't wait around , shoot both , sort it out later .
He just denies it . Why do n't you debate me head-to-head rather than dodging ?
I would seriously suggest that no new threads opened by SS are responded to by reasoning posters until he has responded satisfactorily to the opposing arguments in existing ones . I suggest this should start with the 'Nightmare continues ' thread . Yes , he 'll probably post something like 'No answer , eh , geniuses ? ' , and I agree that 's irritating , but we 'll know - and he 'll know inside himself - that he 's just posturing .
Well , if the mother does n't want the child , it would likely affect her attitude toward the child as it is growing up , usually in a rather negative way ( i.e . feeling unwanted , not needed , etc . )
No , but the first trimester makes my point stronger , and given that 95-98 % of abortions happen then it is a valid distinction .
I have had a quick glance over the article that you gave us on the link . That is strange that they claim that they have evidence that destroys Dr Russell Humphreys Relativistic Cosmology , when the AiG ( a major creationist organisation ) have stated that Dr Humphreys has thus far been able to solve the problem of distant starlight . If what you say is true , than most disturbing this is . I have sent an email to the editorial team at Answers in Genesis for their response . They should reply in a week or so . But the only thing that is different between the big bang and the new Cosmology is the starting assumptions , i.e . bounded and un-bounded universe .
Actually , that 's not the way things go for social animals ; humans especially . Fetuses are not weaker genetically than any other human age groups . At the point of abortion , selection can not even have occured on them .
What typical leftist simone quality propaganda . What 's this victims name ? If she 's a real victim and willing to make an ad , why not give her name to personalize her message ? And are you actually suggesting that it 's ok to justify the killing of at least 1.3 million other babies per year because less than 1 % of the women who get abortions were raped ? HERE 'S the 1 % statistic . And Here 's searching beyond the myths . Rape , Incest and Abortion : Searching Beyond the Myths David C. Reardon , Ph.D. `` How can you deny an abortion to a twelve-year-old girl who is the victim of incest ? '' complains an indignant supporter of abortion . `` And how can you call yourself a loving Christian if you would force a victim of violent rape to give birth to a rapist 's child ? '' Every pro-lifer has heard these same challenges in one form or another . They are the emotionally charged questions designed to prove either 1 ) that pro-lifers are insensitive `` fetus lovers , '' 2 ) or ethically inconsistent , allowing abortion for some circumstances but not others . Unfortunately , most pro-lifers have difficulty answering these challenges because the issue of sexual assault pregnancies is so widely misunderstood . Typically , both sides of the debate accept the presumption that women with sexual assault pregnancies would want an abortion and that the abortion would in some way help them to recover from the assault . Thus , the pro-lifer is left in the uncomfortable position of arguing that the sanctity of life is more important than the needs of the sexual assault victim with whom everyone should rightly sympathize . But in fact , the welfare of the mother and child are never at odds , even in sexual assault cases . Both the mother and child are helped by preserving life , not by perpetuating violence . The reason most people reach the wrong conclusion about abortion in cases of rape and incest is that the actual experiences of sexual assault victims who became pregnant are routinely left out of the debate . Most people , including sexual assault victims who have never been pregnant , are therefore forming opinions based on prejudices and fears which are disconnected from reality . For example , it is commonly assumed that rape victims who become pregnant would naturally want abortions . But in the only major study of pregnant rape victims ever done , Dr. Sandra Mahkorn found that 75 to 85 percent chose against abortion.1 This evidence alone should cause people to pause and reflect on the presumption that abortion is wanted or even best for sexual assault victims . Several reasons are given for not aborting . First , approximately 70 percent of all women believe abortion is immoral , even though many also feel it should be a legal choice for others . Approximately the same percentage of pregnant rape victims believe abortion would be just another act of violence perpetrated against their bodies and their children . Second , some believe that their child 's life may have some intrinsic meaning or purpose which they do not yet understand . This child was brought into their lives by a horrible , repulsive act . But perhaps God , or fate , will use the child for some greater purpose . Good can come from evil . Third , victims of assault often become introspective . Their sense of the value of life and respect for others is heightened . They have been victimized , and the thought that they in turn might victimize their own innocent child through abortion is repulsive . Fourth , at least at a subconscious level , the victim may sense that if she can get through the pregnancy , she will have conquered the rape . By giving birth , she can reclaim some of her lost self-esteem . Giving birth , especially when conception was not desired , is a totally selfless act , a generous act , a display of courage , strength and honor . It is proof that she is better than the rapist . While he was selfish , she can be generous . While he was destroying , she can be nurturing . If giving birth builds self respect , what about abortion ? This is a question which most people fail to even consider . Instead , most people assume that an abortion will at least help a rape victim put the assault behind her and go on with her life . But in jumping to this conclusion , the public is adopting an unrealistic view of abortion . Abortion is not some magical surgery which turns back time to make a woman `` un-pregnant . '' Instead , it is a real life event which is always very stressful and often traumatic . Once we accept that abortion is itself an event with ramifications on a woman 's life , then we must carefully look at the special circumstances of the pregnant rape victim . Will an abortion truly console her , or will it only cause further injury to her already bruised psyche ? In answering this question , it is helpful to begin by noting that many women report that their abortions felt like a degrading and brutal form of medical rape.2 This association between abortion and rape is not hard to understand . Abortion involves a painful examination of a woman 's sexual organs by a masked stranger who is invading her body . Once she is on the operating table , she loses control over her body . If she protests and asks for the abortionist to stop , she will likely be ignored or told : `` It 's too late to change your mind . This is what you wanted . We have to finish now . '' And while she lies there tense and helpless , the life hidden within her is literally sucked out of her womb . The difference ? In a sexual rape , a woman is robbed of her purity ; in this medical rape she is robbed of her maternity . This experiential association between abortion and sexual assault is very strong for many women . It is especially strong for women who have a prior history of sexual assault , whether or not she is presently pregnant as the result of an assault.3 This is just one reason why women with a history of sexual assault are likely to experience greater distress during and after an abortion than other women . Second , research shows that after any abortion , it is common for women to experience guilt , depression , feelings of being `` dirty , '' resentment of men , and lowered self-esteem . What is most significant is that these feelings are identical to what women typically feel after rape . Abortion , then , only adds to and accentuates the traumatic feelings associated with sexual assault . Rather than easing the psychological burdens of the sexual assault victim , abortion adds to them . This was the experience of Jackie Bakker , who reports : `` I soon discovered that the aftermath of my abortion continued a long time after the memory of my rape had faded . I felt empty and horrible . Nobody told me about the pain I would feel deep within causing nightmares and deep depressions . They had all told me that after the abortion I could continue my life as if nothing had happened . '' Those encouraging abortion often do so because they are uncomfortable dealing with rape victims , or perhaps out of prejudice against victims whom they see as being `` guilty for letting it happen . '' Wiping out the pregnancy is a way of hiding the problem . It is a `` quick and easy '' way to avoid dealing with the woman 's true emotional , social and financial needs . According to Kathleen DeZeeuw , `` I , having lived through rape , and also having raised a child 'conceived in rape , ' feel personally assaulted and insulted every time I hear that abortion should be legal because of rape and incest . I feel that we 're being used by pro-abortionists to further the abortion issue , even though we 've not been asked to tell our side . '' The case against abortion of incest pregnancies is even stronger . Studies show that incest victims rarely ever voluntarily agree to an abortion.4 Instead of viewing the pregnancy as unwanted , the incest victim is more likely to see the pregnancy as a way out of the incestuous relationship because the birth of her child will expose the sexual activity . She is also likely to see in her pregnancy the hope of bearing a child with whom she can establish a true loving relationship , one far different than the exploitive relationship in which she has been trapped . But while the incest victim may treasure her pregnancy because it offers her hope of release , and the hope of finding a nurturing love , her pregnancy is a threat to the exploiter . It is also a threat to the pathological secrecy which may envelop other members of the family who are afraid to acknowledge that the abuse is occurring . Because of this dual threat , the victim may be coerced into an unwanted abortion by both the abuser and other family members . For example , Edith Young , a 12-year-old victim of incest impregnated by her stepfather , writes twenty-five years after the abortion of her child : `` Throughout the years I have been depressed , suicidal , furious , outraged , lonely , and have felt a sense of loss ... The abortion which was to 'be in my best interest ' just has not been . As far as I can tell , it only 'saved their reputations , ' 'solved their problems , ' and 'allowed their lives to go merrily on . ' ... My daughter , how I miss her so . I miss her regardless of the reason for her conception . '' Abortion providers who ignore this evidence , and neglect to interview minors presented for abortion for signs of coercion or incest , are actually contributing to the young girl 's victimization . They are not only robbing the victim of her child , they are concealing a crime , abetting a perpetrator , and handing the victim back to her abuser so that the exploitation can continue . Finally , we must recognize that the children conceived through sexual assault also have a voice which deserves to be heard . Julie Makimaa , conceived by an act of rape , works diligently against the perception that abortion is acceptable or even necessary in cases of sexual assault . While sympathetic to the suffering her mother endured at the hands of her attacker , Julie is also rightfully proud of her mother 's courage and generosity . Regarding her own view of her origin , Julie proclaims : `` It does n't matter how I began . What matters is who I will become . '' That 's a slogan we can all live with .
Did n't we supposedly evolve from apes ? Why would it be so impossible to conceive the idea they could have evolved into a different species of human .
For someone who believes the following : `` One can not /should not/ought not to force their own personal moral beliefs onto others , '' it is indeed ridiculous to try and tell somone else : `` You can not /should not/ought not to force your own personal morals on people . '' To do so would be to force a personal moral belief onto somone else , which would render the statement absurd . I 'm not exactly sure what you mean when you say `` the whole moral thing , '' but I doubt it breaks down . Because there are people who hold the position that one can force morality onto someone else , even if only in certain circumstances , it is the case that somebody 's moral belief ( s ) will be forced onto someone else .
So your point is there are developed nations that are not developed because their government has little control of a part or portion of it ? France and parts of Paris where the police do n't go because of the mulims being one ? Seems nit picking to me as you could say that about the USA also .
Well , first , I probably would n't bet my XXX , but whatever you say ... Secondly , I wish Heaven were a candy mountain too ( with Snikers , Milky Way , FUN DIP , Twisters , Skittles , M & amp ; Ms , and super blow-pops ) but it 's not .
You think wrong . Just look at most places in Scandinavia . They are much freer in thier atitude towards sex and they do n't have nearly the the problems as you do . Of course that is on a per capita basis . No , it is ignorance of sex that is the problem in this situation . In the case of many places in the USA it is sort of like `` A little knowledge is a dangerous thing ... ''
No , ID is n't about God . We do n't try to identify THE Intelligent Designer . We just let the evidence of Schrodinger 's equation and the Heisenberg Uncertaint principle lead us to the fact that God exists . I do n't know if anyone can actually `` debate '' me on this . I just wanted to point out some ID ideas that are comical and would n't be so scary if ID people did n't take them seriously .
Actually National Geographic is more accepting of the truth than biased for the argument .
Tank crews and fighter pilots have to get out sooner or later , making them vulnerable to ambush by armed guerrillas . Then again the Second Amendment does n't limit itself to handguns , but rather all modern bearable arms that 're in common use , so we have a full repertoire of arms at our disposal should we need them .
Again , so does the `` theory '' of the flying spaghetti monster . Please explain how ID should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution but not the flyinig spaghetti monster `` theory '' .
According to a report published last year , the average waiting time for a hip replacement in the UK would be about 10 months . This average of course conceals large county and metropolitan variations ( from one National Health Service Trust to another ) . A lot depends on where you live . At least you 'd get the operation for free in this country .
Speaking of chopping heads off ... what would you say if the mother of this child , having delivered it at 22 weeks , decided she did not want to care for it anymore ( or was really mad at it for coming so early ) , and therefore she wanted to chop its head off . What would you say of this scenario , considering that a fetus/child at 22 weeks does not possess the magic trump card of `` mental existence '' ?
Well were are fine thank you very much . If we did it any other way then we would not be Americans . The UK police are not unarmed . Just as the government takes civilian guns away . They were giving them to cops : http : //www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Ar ... 099970,00.html They are carrying full auto machine guns on patrol . Even US cops on patrol do not carry machine guns . `` On Monday in Brixton , south London , 28-year old Derek Bennett was shot six times by an officer who thought he was armed . '' http : //www.wsws.org/articles/2001/ju ... shot-j23.shtml Do n't trust the cops to be in your best interest . Authority is authority . Authority is not in the business of charity , nurture , or progressiveness . Authority is about control . At all levels , from the PIG cop giving tickets for kicks , to tyranical rape and murder ; authority is about control . Ask any cop from any country . They will tell you , when they put on a uniform , something `` magical '' happens . It is the semblance and air of AUTHORITY . Do you really think politicians enter politics for `` public good '' . They all want the office , they want the bearing of the office , they want PRIVILEDGES of office . If they want to be about charity and public good , they why are n't they working for charities ? Why are n't they working in labs to cure cancer ? Why are n't they in soup kitchens ? Why are n't they clegry ? Because none of those idealist efforts offer the priviledges , bearing , and authority of office . Come on , you know they want it . No matter what country your from or what political system , you know they want it . Firearms are not a necessary requirement for freedom . They are a necessary requirement for fighting oppression . I am quite happy to have my politicians and elected represenatives fear me . They are my servants . When people in power do not fear citizens , then people in power have a writ to try anything . Soviets had a meaningless Constitution . Every oppressed industrial government in modern times had a government that had no fear of represials from citizens .
Then why do the police and the FBI exist ? How about neighborhood watch programs ? According to your logic these programs and organizations should all be abolished . Safety is a personal as well as a community responsibility .
Is speciation not defined as , `` The evolutionary formation of new biological species , usually by the division of a single species into two or more genetically distinct ones '' ? If the species must be genetically distinct , then how can you claim that true speciation has occurred when the gulls can still reproduce . This is no different than dogs having several breeds . I do n't call a bulldog a different breed than a beagle .
Actually , with more data that changes the number of assumptions required , it is possible to reach a greater degree of certainty about something . The greater degree of certainty you reach , the better you will be able to apply your findings .
Well , criminals are per definition those who break the law and the law is what you make of it . If private fire arms where illegal , those who would carry a firearm without proper license or permision would be considered criminals . Civil unrest , when turning into violence , is often something bad ...
But what makes them any different from ant hills or beaver dams ? skyscrapers are natural because humans are a part of nature and they built them .
so are handguns .
Again , I do n't know what happenstance origins are , but ruling something out because it 's unlikely does n't work . I have made the poker analogy very often . If you are dealt in order , the 3 of spades , then the 5 of hearts , then the 9 of clubs , then the 4 of diamonds , then the 6 of hearts , would you decide immediately that it was not true ? The odds are ( 1/52 ) * ( 1/51 ) * ( 1/50 ) * ( 1/49 ) * ( 1/48 ) = 1/311,875,200 . This could be done for multiple games . The odds get slimmer and slimmer , but the difference is that something had to happen . No matter what cards you got , the odds of you getting the same card in that order would be this slim .
Of course you do n't . It 's the natural humanistic way of thinking .
Well such a compelling speech ( cough cough ) but this whole small children being involed is irrellivent , since it is the parents moral responsibility to `` lock all guns and ammo in sperate safes or cabinats '' qouting the gun and hunter safety quizes . That and I would also like to make a clear statement on my childhood , I have been around guns well since I was born ... Yet I do n't have an extra breathing hole in my head either , so it aint the guns its the parents who do n't teach there kids proper gun safety and to NEVER PLAY WITH GUNS ! qouting the NRA saftey tips .
Actually , the Second Amendment does n't say anything about due process . It does not say that people on a terror watch list can not be prohibited from buying weapons , but the right can be infringed with due process of law . In fact , the Second Amendment says nothing about the circumstances under which it can be infringed . One scholar comments on the implications of this for the individual rights interpretation : `` If read as an individual right , criminals , convicted felons , pirates , or revolutionaries could all be armed in the District of Columbia or in the federal territories . Pirates could load up their ships on the Potomac River and sail out to sea . Hunters could trample through Yellowstone or some other national park , guns in hand . [ 185 ] Anyone might board a plane , gun in hand , or carry a weapon into Congress , the White House , or any other federal building ... The Fifth Amendment allows the taking of liberty under some circumstances , while the Second , if read as an individual right , does not . '' Chicago-Kent Law Review 18th Century Pennsylvania , which had its own RKBA , passed a law which required citizens to take an oath of allegiance to the state or face being disarmed . This was to protect the state against those who might be loyal to the British Crown . So why ca n't the US take similar measures to protect itself against terrorists ?
in defense of the fruit fly , why would one evolve when one is already suited well to their environment ? what good does a 7th leg do ? and about the experiment itself - please , ALWAYS post references . who did the experiment ? when ? under what conditions ? how ? assuming you were correct about the experiment , were variables put in place such as habitat changes to reflect the timeline you speak of , a large variety of fruit flies to begin with , random mating , etc etc or did some people just shoot some x rays at a couple fruit flies , did some arithmetic which was probably wrong and called it that ? and im sorry , but there is mountains of direct evidence for evolution , you just need to go and look at it .
In this case I 'm afraid it does . ( 1 ) To see if the OJ scene would once again playout . ( 2 ) To see a ruling made on behalf of an unborn child . All the rest is one dumb killer , IMO .
okay ... maybe he was a little pushy , but it made me wonder about this issue . I looked at some of the links presented by creationists ; a book that attacks evolutionary biology by an electrical engineer , and a long rant about a false dichotomy established by evolutionists where they will reject any theory that does n't correspond to a philosophy of naturalism . The latter ( http : //www.trueorigin.org/creatheory.asp ) actually presented one aspect of a theory of creation . That being that all creatures started off with all the genetic information they needed and that observed change in animals is a degredation of information . This runs counter to evolutionary theory that simple unicellular organisms with simple DNA eventually became more complex . This is actually a decent claim , in the sense that it is a model that can be examined ... and quickly thrown out for obvious reasons ( antibiotic resistance , why are all creatures on earth so similar in genetic makeup ) I was wondering if anyone could bolster this claim or present another theory of creation . Really , unless some kind of theory is presented , all you are doing is bashing evolution . I can bash the laws of motion too ( not well , though ) but it does n't disprove them . Perhaps I 'm a little pushy too , but I find it annoying when truth is replaced with ... other things .
Actually I did not know what Nato had posted . I found it quite interesting . I know that when I and my wife attended church , I thought about that possibility . Someone who Hates us just because we go to church , and I thought about bringing the problem up . I quickly dismissed the probability of something like this happening because right across the street , is the Fairview Police Station . However , this is exactly where things like this do happen . In places where one is not allowed to carry a concealed firearm .
So you are saying that genetics has nothing to do with genetics ?
Actually no , I know of many others who agree with this and the number of people believing in religion worldwide is decreasing , but just to make this interesting , why do n't you prove you are right . Show me one place where I said exactly what God was . Go ahead hot shot I 'd like to see it . LOL
But he is right : Ray offered yet more evidence that he is at least as stupid as HUnter and you totally failed to refute that evidence . What 's the current odds BTW that both Hunter and Ray will fail to address Pandion 's evidence that Hitler was YEC ?
The word `` evolution ' '' generally means change , not `` advance '' , so we can speak of `` stellar evolution '' or the evolution of a planetary surface . These are each large fields of science with many people studying them . The `` biological Theory of Evolution '' is completely different . From my viewpoint coming from the physical sciences , at the present time , the `` Theory of Evolution '' , which is the study of how genetic material changes over time , has become so completely validated by making so many accurate and useful predictions , that it can now just be considered biology . What most creationists seem to be disputing is just science , since they do n't specify , and use the term `` evolution '' too broadly .
Well is this serious science or is this ring-around-the-rosie on Sesame Street ? Am I just supposed to play make-believe and/or use my imagination ? I can do that -- for instance , when I play with my kids , I 'm real good at playing the role of `` Ken '' when we imagine that `` Barbie goes to the beach '' Surely the fossil record shows gradualism or not . I bought a book a while back at a half-price bookstore from Niles Eldredge . He says the following about gradualism : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Change in this manner ( gradualism ) is just not found in the fossil record . pg . 48 Darwin invented the myth that species were not real to convince the world of the nonmyth that evolution had occured . pg . 52 Darwin 's prediction that long-term evolutionary change should produce a systematic pattern of gradual , progressive change in the fossil record was faulty . pg . 53 As we have seen in the previous chapter , the usual conception casts evolution as a gradual , steady process of adaptive change . And we have already seen that the fossil record conflicts with that view . pg . 57 We 're faced more with a great leap of faith -- that gradual , progressive , adaptive change underlies the general pattern of evolutionary change we see in the rocks -- than any hard evidence . pg . 57 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I guess I would consider myself more of a PE guy than a gradualist simply because of what the fossils indicate . It seems to me that instead of evolving gradually that animals evolve quickly -- like the spiders on my shed . ( do you find it odd that they emerged yellow in the spring ? ) It seems butterflies have this same ability ... ..Evolution sure is amazing ! For instance , Monteiro said , the darker wing patterns that show up in butterflies that emerge in the spring serve to warm up the butterfly faster , whereas butterflies that emerge in the summer have lighter colors . `` Also , many butterflies that emerge in the wet season in the tropics have large , conspicuous marks on their wings that deflect the attacks of predators while the butterflies are actively finding mates and laying eggs , while the dry-season cohorts are very cryptic , trying to blend in with their environment and not attract any attention from predators until the rains arrive again , '' she said http : //unisci.com/stories/20021/0313021.htm
All your posts are like this . Are you on crack ?
lol , you know what , I think you were !
Yeah and he was n't prosecuted for the legal act you 're referring to . If so then anybody could be prosecuted for possessing a firearm prior to the ban even if they voluntarily turned in their guns already . The problem is that he did n't turn in his gun . So that analogy with changing the speed limit is a false analogy . Let 's not confuse the issue .
Well abortion is a law thing and for the most part it seems like he was getting after the US ( as he has done in other posts ) ... nevertheless , starving children are around even with abortion and there is no reason to believe abortion has `` helped '' this problem .
Oh my . Where to begin . First of all , being homosexual has abso-f'n-lutely nothing to do with beastiality . I get so tired of that correlation . Homosexuals are humans that have sex with the humans of the same sex . Nothing to do with animals . Next time you eat a hamburger , let 's arrest you for accessory to murder , after all , killing a cow is just as illegal as killing humans , at least according to your logic . As for the word `` gay '' , it started as an insult towards the homosexual community . Similarly to `` nigger '' , it was adopted by the very people it insulted to take some of the power out of the word . Now , with that said , I do NOT belittle the racist struggle by making that comparison . I know that the African-Americans have struggled thru much more than the homosexual community . I do n't make the comparison according to scale , but to the logic of it .
Actually , when I opened this picture it appeared to be approximately 6 inches tall . Upon just a quick glance , I determined that this was the skeletal remains of an ancient smurf . My God man ! You have just confirmed the existence of Papasmurfidae ! I would n't pontificate on the nature of the scriptures based upon a quick glance any more than I would attempt to determine the origin of the species by glossing through Ask Jeeves . I can tell you however that jacob begetting enoch and enoch begetting Ralph , etc etc etc , does not approach the current acceptable age of the earth Sir . Even if you allow for Methuselah to live 900 years . Describe the shape of your skull sir . Perhaps a break through awaits . As for my own skull , it is deforming with each successive post from repeated blows to the forehead by my open palm . If the lack of complete records has you befuddled , consider my own curiousity at the utter dearth of evidence for a planet of an age described in the bible . Evolutionists may not have all of the puzzle pieces in place , but one can determine what the picture looks like . I ca n't think of one piece that would support the view to which you subscribe .
Keep Going : `` F. Myth # 6 : The Second Amendment militia is the National Guard . The Founding Fathers made it clear that the Militia was composed of the populace at large . Both the Congress and Supreme Court have affirmed this definition of the Militia . 1 . Founding Fathers * George Mason : `` I ask , who are the militia ? They consist now of the whole people , except a few public officers . `` 145 * Virginia Constitution , Art . I , Sec . 13 ( 1776 ) : `` That a well-regulated militia , composed of the body of the people , trained to arms , is the proper , natural , and safe defense of a free State ; that standing armies , in time of peace , should be avoided , as dangerous to liberty ... . '' * Richard Henry Lee : `` To preserve liberty , it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms , and be taught alike , especially when young , how to use them ... . The mind that aims at a select militia [ like the National Guard ] , must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle . `` 146 2 . U.S. Congress * The Militia Act of 1792 . One year after the Second Amendment was added to the Constitution , Congress passed a law defining the militia . The Militia Act of 1792 declared that all free male citizens between the ages of 18 and 44 were to be members of the militia . Furthermore , every citizen was to be armed . The Act stated : `` Every citizen ... [ shall ] provide himself with a good musket , or firelock , a sufficient bayonet and belt , two spare flints ... . '' 147 The Militia Act of 1792 made no provision for any type of select militia such as the National Guard . * U.S. Senate Subcommittee Report ( 1982 ) . `` In the Militia Act of 1792 , the second Congress defined 'militia of the United States ' to include almost every free adult male in the United States . These persons were obligated by law to possess a [ military-style ] firearm and a minimum supply of ammunition and military equipment ... . There can be little doubt from this that when the Congress and the people spoke of the a 'militia , ' they had reference to the traditional concept of the entire populace capable of bearing arms , and not to any formal group such as what is today called the National Guard . `` 148 * Current Federal Law : 10 U.S.C . Sec . 311 . `` The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and ... under 45 years of age who are , or who have made a declaration of intention to become , citizens of the United States ... . '' 149 3 . Supreme Court : U.S. v. Miller ( 1939 ) . In this case , the Court stated that , `` The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense ... [ and that ] when called for service , these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time . `` 150 `` `` The Right of the People ''
Because they have evolved beyond a desperate paranoia about their fellow countrymen .
Once one is adept at finding evidence after a conclusion is presumed , all sorts of `` proofs '' reveal themselves . What 's next , Nostradamus ?
So even though both the BATFE and the Fraternal Order of Police have both come out in support of keeping gun trace data private , even though if it became public record and a criminal could obtain a shopping list of gun owners by filling out an FOIA request , you still think the Tiahrt Amendment should be done away with ?
Well , we 're not devoid of emotion . So you can know God through your whole self , not just a small part of you ( i.e . logic ) . We Orthodox believe in noetic knowledge , that is , knowledge gained through 'the heart ' .
I do n't know anyone on the committees , but people I know who have taken a look at the initial proposal and understand the current Oregon public health program ( manages Medicaid and other fed/state health funds ) say it 's financially feasible by the proposal to combine current private policy subscriptions ( including civil service at all levels other than federal ) and fed/state/muni contributions . I 'm told the key will be deductibles and how they scale them . Oregon 's schools ( excluding rural designations ) would have plenty of money if educator unions did n't have funding in a stranglehold . Word is that unless benefits and retirement now equaling private sector CEO levels are n't cut back the system will crash within the next decade . Off-topic , but civil service pay and benefits are an upcoming US crisis . Unions have switched from ruining manufacturing industries to the public sector . The county I live in already has a dual work force , union and non-union , with union workers to eventually disappear by attrition . Maybe sooner when looking at budget forecasting .
Many people would allow abortions in extreme cases because they figure that since extreme cases make up about 5 % of abortions then if they can get all but extreme cases then they will be saving at least 95 % , which is better than nothing . After that they can work towards stopping all abortions . It 's a step-by-step process . I say abortion of all kinds should be illegal . 95 % of abortions are a result of consentual sex . We should n't cater to the 5 % just because they 've had a tough situation . I sympathize with them and would do what I could to help them , but they do still need to have the baby , whether they give it up for adoption or not . This is n't a horribly unreasonable position . It 's just a difficult position . Saying it 's alright to kill a baby for any reason is a horribly unreasonable position . People need to face the facts too . Sex is n't there for pleasure , it 's there for procreation and happens to be pleasureable . Someone who indulges in this pleasure should be ready to deal with the outcome , which oftentimes is a baby .
Sinjin 's in Kalifornia . Carrying more than two bandoliers across your chest is so Rambo and 80's-esque .
And what 's so wrong about that ?
And there you have hit the nail on the head ; there are both good and P-poor parents out there . Each case should be taken on its own merits ; it 's dam tough to make one rule fit all . Impossible , actually .
Can you say run-on sentence ? I knew you could ! It seems that we have another scientific illiterate ( as well as another English semi-literate ) . Before you talk about science , learn what it is and how it works . Science does not `` prove '' things . It explains them . Science is the investigation of natural phenomena through observation , theoretical explanation , and experimentation , or the knowledge produced by such investigation . How is it that you think that rocks that were once bones are not old . Are you not aware that fossils are not the preserved remains of organisms ? The organic materials have been replaced by minerals and they are rock . Ever actually see a fossil ? Ever actually hold one ?
I know people always seem to misunderstand you , but you seem to be arguing here that pain can arise from both material and from non-material causes . O.K . A physical ( or material ) cause of pain would probably be associated with some kind of pathology , injury , auto-immune system disorder etc . - so there should be an organic explanation for it and there usually is . Sometimes no such explanation can be found and this may be down to limitations in the present state of medical knowledge ( which you say is beside the point ) . Now pain that has no apparent physical cause you seem say can be identified by psychologists has having a non-material origin . The kind of non-material origin that you mention `` the power of the mind '' is really a catch-all explanation that explains nothing . If you know of any non-physical causes of pain , please specify .
And you try to grow a brain cell . That does n't answer anything . Galileo , I did notice your link ; and it did say that the guns were bought in the same year as the discharge . However , they seemed very shy on specifying what dates the guns were bought on and when he was discharged . If he bought them after the discharge , then the only ways he could 've bought them legally were with a fake ID , bribery , etc . ; which actually are n't legal . Oh , and I still wonder if those police officers families would feel better if the guns were illegally obtained ... I assure you that even if he did get them semi-legally , he did n't own them legally . The only way he could 've got them was by cheating the legal system , and the only way he could 've kept them was by hiding them . I 'll also acknowledge the possibility that the dealer was lazy with the background check ; but no matter what happened , somebody did something illegal .
Shall I continue ...
And yet they also claim other reasons ... fraud and $ , which I was addressing .
Incorrect- I think Olsen is very specific in citing those he feels have overstepped the mark in this instance . He is not ruling out the possibility of a link at all- he ( rightly IMO ) is targeting certain workers and publications .
I 'm not trying to prove anything . I 'm asking if you 'd think differently in that case , and you 're not answering .
Never get published though
I know the Left thinks this is just an example of delusional paranoia , but allow me to add some incite ! ( Not that I , or we , care about what you think is driving this increased sales , because it is really None of Your Business ! ) However , I have a very liberal friend who often talked of his concern about people he didnt want to be armed . However , back when the Brady Bill requiring background checks was passed , and before its implementation , he purchased a 357 Magnum handgun with some of the nastiest hollow points that were on the market ! When I asked him why , he told me that he didnt want the government to know what he owned . It simply was none of their business , because they work for us ! It is not the other way around ! ( I liked that saying so much I stole it from him and you have seen it used several times here now . ) The above is the REAL answer to the question of why this is happening now ! And there is NOTHING you on the Left can do about it either ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Total NICS Firearm Background Checks November 30 , 1998 - October 31 , 2009
The wikipedia reference has recorded data from : `` The Mauna Loa Observatory ( MLO ) is an atmospheric baseline station on Mauna Loa volcano , on the big island of Hawaii . Since 1957 MLO has been continuously monitoring and collecting data relating to atmospheric change , and is known especially for their continuous monitoring of atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) levels , which is sometimes referred to as the Keeling Curve . The observatory is under the Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory ( CMDL ) which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) . '' Could it possibly be that we should be considering an increased activity of the volcano ? Are we interpreting what we observe erroneously ?
And HOW do you know that homosexuals do n't repent ?
Here 's what those verses - and the one in the middle of them that he conveniently left out - say .
And I 've been to Paluxy and I still do n't blieve that there are human tracks among the dinosaur tracks .
It never will . The Wild West , incidently , had a markedly lower crime rate than we have today . Potential criminals knew they could be shot by just about any passerby who witnessed their crime .
And `` why is the United States so backward in regard to children 's rights to their lives ? ''
So I guess we should all be armed with guns then . And if we XXXX someone off , feel the comfort of knowing that they have a gun and can blow our brains out whenever they want on the spot . Everyone grab a gun ! ! We dont have enough violence in the United States as it is ! And arm your children too ! ! Ignore the stories about children accidently shooting eachother .
I agree ... it 's just too bad sometimes with young adults they do n't think about what might happen , they just respond with natural urges . And this results sometimes is someone becoming `` with child `` even though it was not what they set out to do ! So should we force them to have the child and put it up for adoption ? If so consider there are lots of children waiting to be taken in and most of them are n't infants .
Yo shush yo mouth ! Doncha knows that tha bible is fo believahs ! Yas got ta believah furst ! That 's right , if you read it without believing first , you 'll see the flaws and contradictions . You need to magic indwelling spirit of Suspension of Disbelief to fully understand what they bibles about .
Well said , Kronus . Very well indeed .
I know a number of Christians who do actually stick to this belief .
I dunno . Perhaps more loving familes to adopt parentless children ? A larger tax base ? Less disease transfer ? Silly me , I forgot , those are GOOD things ! The antis keep saying that gay marriage leads to bad things , so obviously I classified such outcomes as bad .
Are you talking about Archie ? What do you know about his life ? What we can be sure of it that he is n't careful about telling the truth on this discussion board . Sometimes he says what he thinks is true because he has n't bothered to educate himself . At other times he tells intentional lies . Hey ! You two seem to be a lot alike .
You mean yours . Make up your mind as to whether or not there 's a problem and what it is . State for the board .
Mullets swim into this big old placid lagoon seeing nothing but calm clear waters not realizing it is filled with a bunch of voracious sharks
Of course . The Kellerman study points out that a firearm is 43 times more likely to be used on its owner than in self defense . This is why it makes perfect sense to hand all our guns over to criminals . We can then take them away using Kung Fu and use them against their owners . ( According to Kellerman , we are guaranteed to be 43 times more successful that way . )
That 's is ridiculously poor logic . Simply becuase the church makes mistakes does n't mean it 's incorrect in all other charges . The US government is WAY more corrupt than the Catholic Church , and yet we obey every god-damned thing big brother makes us do .
What were the circumstances of your , `` looking at a gun , barrell end facing you , with a criminal on the other end '' ? I live in a place where local evening news includes a story about children being shot or killed at least weekly . I have never been accosted by an armed assailant . Hence , I see no reason I need to carry a concealed handgun in order to be brave enough to move about my hometown .
And I agree with that . Religion is rubbish , imo .
actually , the more common usage would be CE . and BCE ( COmmon era , and before common era )
Sorry to let you know that is the kind of reasoning that is not to far off for anti-gunners . Ideas such as `` we do not know who is a criminal so get them all '' kind of rationale is typical . Just like the babies , everyone is INNOCENT , until proven guilty . You can not even begin to restrict rights , assume guilt , or perform pro-active crime prevention without some major civil rights violations .
Actually , no , that is not what I said . I said :
Well you seem to use your head for something Addison48 , unlike some we shall leave unnamed . By the way Whiny its later than you think . lol .
Just imagine for a second that you were armed when two individuals showed up with shotguns . Would you really have been able to do something that would n't have resulted in the death and/or injury of one or more innocents , including you yourself ? Did anyone die as a result of the robbery ? Would people have died if you had acted vigilante ?
Can you explain to me what that is ? I 've never been able to get a straight answer . In particular , what was supposed to have happened , and when ?
Uh oh , Mr. Poe 's proclamation crashes and burns right there - the Bible says no such thing . This is where a satire quickly changes from something that starts out as mocking , ( designed to be something that could be innocence ) to a complete lie . It never takes long for atheist satirists to demonstrate their lack of knowledge of the Bible . Atheist mockers dont seem to be quite as skilled as Mr Poe would have us believe .
And finally , my own letter to the editor , which was printed in this week 's Sunday paper ( 08/28/2005 ) .
The one thing Dobson ca n't answer logically relates to incest and rape . Why ? This is a matter for the victim to deal with . . . .not the infallable law of the bible . It 's always interesting to me that the bible thumpers refuse to look at abortion other than through religious , save the fetus , eyes and yet , are ready to KILL the sicko 's of society when they have committed a haneous crime . Too many `` thumpers '' do n't read all of bible . And yet the same bible states : Abortion is not murder . A fetus is not considered a human life . If men strive , and hurt a woman with child , so that her fruit depart from her , and yet no mischief follow : he shall be surely punished , according as the woman 's husband will lay upon him ; and he shall pay as the judges determine . And if any mischief follow , then thou shalt give life for life . -- Exodus 21:22-23 The Bible places no value on fetuses or infants less than one month old . And if it be from a month old even unto five years old , then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver , and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver . -- Leviticus 27:6 Fetuses and infants less than one month old are not considered persons . Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers , by their families : every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them . And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD . -- Numbers 3:15-16 God sometimes approves of killing fetuses . And Moses said unto them , Have ye saved all the women alive ? ... Now therefore kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him . -- Numbers 31:15-17 ( Some of the non-virgin women must have been pregnant . They would have been killed along with their unborn fetuses . ) Your bible , not mine . Maybe Dobson needs to read a bit more of his bible rather than condeming others . Is n't he supposed to be a psychologist ? What 's his expertise in biblical literature ? I think we all need to read a bit more before we critize how others live .
So ? I was n't just re-expressing YOUR inequalities . In fact , I made it clear that I was providing BETTER inequalities than you did . YOU EVEN QUOTED ME AS SAYING THAT ! ! ! Then you turn right around and pretend that I did n't anything of the sort ? ! ? ! Get real dude . PS : The most correct representation of the three main combinations of e and c is as follows ( one which I did present in the post you are replying to ) : e - c > e + c > c - e
so if right now , i ask god for forgivness , someone kills me , i will go to heaven by default ? makes sense to me , i mean , i dont have time to sin ...
Well if you do n't know the facts then why do you keep coming back for more ?
So what ? A lot of guns we own today come from various countries . And do n't forget , a lot of the early gun makers in America were German . They gave us the first ever American rifles , capable of killing a redcoat out to 300 yards ; three times the effective distance of the Brown Bess musket .
Which , Monkeys or Man ?
Yes , that 's what he is saying . It seems that in your small , closeted little world of ignorance you are n't aware that a Roman Catholic would never refer to a priest as a preacher . Miller was talking about the ministers of the non-Eucharistic protestant sects , like yours , that rely more on words than deeds . However , original sin is a basic tenet of Catholicism . Your failure to know that is yet another sign of your ignorance . In fact , the source of your concept of original sin is Roman Catholicism , probably through several other invented religions .
Actually it does make it so , since you can search every abortion debate ever had on this or any forum and the prevailing argument by the pro-abortionist is the nullification of human rights by the unborn because they are n't sentient human beings yet . You must deny their humanity in order to ease your consciences as flaming liberals since you are condoning , endorsing and defending the murders of more than a million real human beings each year in the USA alone . What it comes down to iangb , is that you secularists will lie to yourselves as needed in order to convince yourselves that what you 're doing is n't mass genocide of the most innocent and defenseless class of people among us . So continue to lie to yourself if it gets you through the day , iangb . Convince yourself that you can pick and choose what is absolute truth in this life too , and see how far that gets you . What is so sad about you sanctimonious secularists is that you look at us so condescendingly when you do n't have a clue about what 's true or what really matters in this life . If it was n't so pathetic , it would actually be humorous .
Your idea of responsibilities is twisted . Why should anyone other than the criminals , be required to pay a tax for the actions of criminals ? By your logic the public should be paying fines that the media outlet would face for lying .
I only wish it were so simple .
You put your faith in 911 , I 'll put mine in 9mm . While I would call 911 I 'll still arm myself first , to make sure I 'm still around if and when the cops get here , if they so choose .
So you 're a perfect clone of one your parents with zero copying errors ? Amazing .
I see that .
Actually , the old Black Codes were made useless by the 14th amendment and did more good for the Black movement and civil rights workers who could then protect themselves . Last time I saw the NAACP and Black Panthers was in Houston and the streets were lined with BP armed with AK 47s so I think your quote by Julian Bond is a mite off base Of course we know you would never stoop to deceive
See above . Nothing has been demonstrated that convinces me that God has been ruled out of all these issues . He probably is n't active in all situations , but there 's nothing that says he ( or even Satan ) are totally inconsequential either .
And that value is ? As I 've carefully pointed out to you before , I am not atheist or left-wing . If you continue using what are erroneous labels , I 'll consider them as derogatory , personal attacks .
Well , we could then rephrase the question : `` When does a person stop existing physically ? ''
Because it could be you next .
As I said earlier , it is garbage . He ca n't back it up . As a scientist-in-training , you know that real science requires research and evidential support . supersport has neither . The `` support '' that he cites -- when read in their entirety -- do little or nothing to actually support him . On one forum ( mentioned earlier on this forum ) , the author of the scientific paper that supersport cited actually joined the board to tell supersport to stop misrepresenting his research . The only `` agenda '' that the scientific community has is to find the truth . The fact that the scientific community trounces supersport 's points nonstop is not what makes his points wrong ; his points are wrong on their own merit , and they 'd be wrong regardless of anybody 's refutations of them .
And just as soon as you can show that has any relevance to the discussion , I 'll be happy to spend more time on it .
Hey - there 's plenty of disordered liberal Democrat women badgering conservative men and women tea party participants . Including the head mistress , Nancy Pelosi and all her sychophants . At least we 're on the right side of the issues , trying to shoot down another big-government , bureaucratic , wallet-busting , job-killing , liberty-gutting abortion . What all pro-abortion pundits have in common : THEIR MOTHERS ALL CHOSE LIFE !
The title of the thread gives a false impression by stating that a Christian Pastor believes that bigotry blocked Gay Marriage . Had the title said , pro-gay pastor believes bigotry blocked gay marriage , his position would have appeared as obvious as his views are . She is attempting to make it sound like the christian community is split , but bible believing pastors would n't be caught dead endorsing what this pastor believes in any aspect of his so called faith .
So you dont think Dawkins is a liberal ? You dont think Dawkins favors northern , liberal universities over southern , conservative universities ?
That 's what faith does . It limits your options .
Agreed
Simply put , there is zero evidence to support the theories of divine creation or intelligent design . One might as well believe that invisible flying space monkeys built the earth .
http : //www.answersingenesis.org/docs/405.asp What we can say is , however , that it passed Peer Review :
So when you know you have lost , you resort to insult ? Is that how this goes ? What was either filthy or immature about obvious_child 's post ?
Well excuuuuuuuuuuuse me . You are obviously not simply inquiring into the way people think then , so instead of asking generally what people think , why do n't you tell us exactly who you are looking for so they can present themselves .
Actually Kelvin wants people to be able to bring guns onto planes . In my debate with him he said it would be alright if a group of arabs in body armor and heavily armed walked onto the plane as long as they had tickets for the flight . He did n't want their intentions questioned at all as to why they were doing what they were . He will defend the constitutional rights to no end but will ignore all logic in the process .
And many KKK members are fond of puppies . That does n't make their politics any less abhorant . And it 's politics were talking about here , not home life . If you 're getting into polical discussions and find yourself on the same side as the KKK , you may well benefit from re-examine your positions .
Compared to what ? The U.S. ? That would be laughable if it was n't so serious , it is plain ridiculous . The CDC and NAS studies Tither has posted so many times still has n't sunk it has it ? There is no benefit to any gun control law that has been studied ! Now here you are ignoring and contradicting scientific facts ... again . Take Chicago , they have strict gun laws and have over 3 times the national rate of murders .
Well , that aughta shut you up , eh Hank ? LOL ! Way to disprove the virgin birth , IMRAHIL . Of course neither the virgin birth story or the creation story are true . If a similar occurance were to happen today , the same ppl who believe it could have happened in antiquity would consider it ridiculous , and scrutinize the occurance to a degree they would never question their dogma .
And what do you specifically mean by your use here of `` homophobic ? '' It 's one of those words that carries an enormous range of degree . To some degree , probably most of society is homophobic , so I 'm not sure your statement really means much .
Can you tell us what you would accept as `` proof '' ? You can be shown any number of transitional sequences that demonstrate evidence , but the level of evidence needed for your own personal `` proof '' is up to you . Proof is for mathematics , science works by evaluating competing theories using evidence and eliminating those which do not predict observed results .
Actually , natural selection is one of the mechanisms of evolution . There is more to it than that , but creationists with limited knowledge ca n't figure that out .
Homosexuals are attracted to people of the same sex whether they be adults are children ... ... ... ... .The vast majority of the priests who were charged admitted to being gay ... ... ... ...
Well , I have disagreed . But supposing that you are right ( and you are not as I have shown ) , then you have successfully shown that abortion is frowned upon in Scripture . The verses you quote ALL describe the actions in those verses negatively . Congratulations , you proved what you were trying to disprove .
Material The substance or substances out of which a thing is or can be made . http : //dictionary.reference.com/search ? q=material So , in fact the defintion for material is that it is made of material So therefore , according to Mach , because that definition is of itself , it ca n't exist . Of course he could say it 's atoms etc. , but that 's what material makes up , not what makes up material
Occam 's razor . Now lets hear your proof ( as if you have any ) .
I know what you meant . My comment was to demonstrate the counter side of the issue . Interracial marriage laws were overturned at a time when this country disapproved of interracial marriage by a margin of three to one . By your approach , interracial marriage laws SHOULD NOT have been overturned in the 1960 's . In fact , by your approach we still would have had illegal interracial marriage into the late 80 's , early 90 's . The 14th amendment makes no proviso about allowing unjust discrimination in cases of majority rule . By your approach , WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT ? If the majority disapproves of the discrimination , they simply `` vote '' it out of existence . No need for the courts at all .
I know a bit about this myself . However the difference is that I was allowed to carry a gun under the reasonable man statute . An Armed person truly can not be bullied ! The old saying is . God created man and Samuel Colt made them equal ! Old , disabled , female and all , are on an equal footing with these vicious predators !
that is not true . a levitating guru that has been seen and proven to levitate doesnt make the process natural . an alien that has been seen and proven to teleport and abduct people in their retractor beam doesnt make the process less paranormal . the definition of supernatural/paranormal doesnt automatically mean they can never be observed , just that they defy physical law . the definition of God is a special case that includes never being observed/proven
Oh my goodness , yes . I had forgotten that scenario . How silly of me .
so in order for me to win this debate I have to explain how thoughts turn into physical realities ? C'mmon . That 's what 's so damaging about these types of experiements ... such as the one with the spine-developing flea . You stick a predator near a bug or other creature , and amazingly new morphology develops -- either during development or even later in life . Snails , for example can grow larger when predators are around . Lots of things are like that . Fish , for example , in small fish tanks have a tendency to stay small , while the same type fish in very big tanks get much bigger . Thus , something inside the organism is putting the brakes on growth . But what is it ? Just because I can not point to this particular entity does not mean it does n't exist -- the evidence is right there in front of you that external stimuli is physically acted upon by the organism -- probably by way of a nervous system response . This is why science has forever ignored doing experiments on animals by changing their locations and checking for responsive , heritable phenotypic adjustments . They simply do not want to have to confront the notion that life changes non-materialistically -- that thought or awareness can start the process of physical change ... .that there are causes to biological change . This concept of mind over matter is simply unexplainable by science because science is not interested in the mind -- or anything else that can not be measured or defined . If I raise my arm and then claim that there was a thought-command before hand , how would I ever prove to you that there was indeed a thought-command that caused the arm to raise ?
Actually , you are still quibbling . First , after I told you that you were wrong you came up with the `` it may be in his diary '' bit . Later it has moved to an earlier version of OTOOS . The answer is quite simple . NOPE . I searched through The LIfe and Letters of Charles Darwin , vol I & amp ; II , More Letters of Charles Darwin , vol I & amp ; II , On the Origin of Species , 1st and 6th editions , The Autobiography of Charles Darwin , and The Voyage of the Beagle . None even contain the word `` microbiology '' . Darwin made several references to microscopes and his use of them . He had one on the Beagle . But nowhere does any of that discussion refer to the impossibility of his theory . Maybe you would be so kind as to tell me where you had access to Darwin 's diary . Or maybe you either made up that assertion or were just an ignorant dupe of someone like Hovind making a claim like that . Where did it come from .
I think dropping trou for illicit gay sex has nothing to do with genes . It 's a deliberate behavior .
Well at least more coherent if the joints are tight and the glue is any good at all !
Again , you are the affirmative , you must support your claims . Please support the claim that we are using an atheist presupposition . I think we are using more an agnostic presupposition , which is a neutral one .
Well you should protect yourself of course , that is your right ( and duty ) as a human being , but that 's not what the 2nd amendment is for . It 's just convenient that the tools that protect you from tyranny can also be used to protect yourself against criminals .
It is entirely possible for a man armed with one hand grenade , and yes , hand grenades can be bought , to not only take out a tank , but kill everyone inside . All one would have to do is catch a tank on patrol , while it is at idle speed , jump up on the tank and toss the grenade down the tanks barrell . The explosion from the grenade would cause the shell in the tanks barrell to also explode , and then the rest of the ammo in the tank , and wallah , dead crew and no more opperable tank . As far as a plane is concerned , almost all of todays planes are controlled by computers , at least the guidance and weapons systems , so I would try to bring a plane down with a simple computer . You tell one planes weapons to target another plane , and boom , one less plane . Or one might dig a trench with which to trap a tank , and after a tank falls into the trench and gets stuck , you kill the exiting soldiers , pull the tank out , and now you have your very own tank . Of course , none of this is full proof , but it is highly possible .
It is possible that I , in a coma , might be having mental processes in the form of dreams and memories . That could probably be determined by an EEG or something comparable .
Then surely you can see that happenstance origins taught in science classes on the level that it is today comes dangerously close to violating the establishment clause of the first amendment ! Do we rectify that by attempting to eliminate happenstance origins from science class ? Nooooo , we rectify it by allowing the proper amount of ID in science class to balance it !
Because bibliolaty does n't equal Christianity . There are two issues here : 1 ) many may worship Christ through analysis of sources of his life and/or the inspiration of the holy spirit without believing all of the Bible is valid in any sense 2 ) many who do accept the totality of the Bible as meaningful are aware of the huge amount of metaphor , poetry etc . in it . Is everything to be seen as from God 's point of view ? Are the Psalms and Song of Solomon not powerful and illuminating human expressions of love and faith ?
Sounds good .
One wonders if there was n't an element of racism involved .
This is where intuitive , ready agreement with the opening paragraph starts to get the reader into trouble . All facts are interpreted according to presuppositions , so it 's only fair that Creationists should get to bring their presuppositions to the table just like everyone else , right ? Well , let 's apply that same blanket reasoning to other situations and see what happens . Imagine a juror whose personal prejudices lead him to presuppose the guilt of a defendant based on her skin colour , and to interpret the facts of the case accordingly . Should he be allowed to sit in judgement ? Of course not - but according to the reasoning presented by AiG that leaves us in an impossible position : by eliminating those jurors predisposed to return a guilty verdict based upon race , we necessarily cede the court to those predisposed to return an innocent verdict based upon race . Our intuition rightly rebels at this false dichotomy . We readily apprehend the existence of a middle ground wherein skin colour confers neither automatic guilt nor automatic innocence . Ah , but ! Is that neutrality itself not merely another presupposition , another axiom through which the facts are being interpreted ? One might protest that it is not , that the irrelevance of skin colour as a determinant of guilt can be determined empirically . But it would be in vain , because there are , after all , no such thing as 'brute facts ' . The data you supply to justify your position only do so when interpreted according to your presupposition that guilt can be race-agnostic . To someone whose presupposition is otherwise , your 'facts ' mean something quite different - they might for instance mean the research itself must be corrupt and biased , or at least faulty in some unknown way . In short , following Ken Ham 's reasoning we find ourselves deep in a rabbit hole with no end in sight . We can venture to justify no opinion or belief , because the facts that appear to support one may upon the least whim be reinterpreted in the light of another . I may if I so choose presuppose the bible to be the work of the devil himself , and I am not to be chastised nor deterred through argument , for the axioms by which I choose to interpret the world are , in Ken 's eyes , inviolate . This is hardly the result Ken could have intended . What 's gone wrong ? Why has his fair-minded attempt to level the playing field backfired so badly ? The answer , of course , is that the playing field is n't really level . Every once in a while someone will decide that he can fly , and attempt to demonstrate this facility to the world by leaping from a high place . The world thus far has remained largely unimpressed . This is an extreme example of what can happen when the axioms one uses to interpret the world conflict with those upon which it really operates , and it provides the first key to unlocking our dilemma : Good axioms yield accurate predictions . As Ken rightly observed , known facts are always subject to interpretation . But the reverse process , the prediction of facts yet to come based on a formulated theory , is not . In making a prediction we are forced to stop shoehorning data into our preconceived worldview and make a statement about what we will find . This yields the closest thing we have to a truly objective measurement of congruence between theory and reality . This understanding allows us to validate or repudiate the presuppositions we bring to bear on the facts at our disposal . The racist juror would from the outset predict the evidence to be presented would turn out to be stacked against the defendant , but his low 'hit rate ' would invalidate his axiom . So , part of what distinguishes Creationism from mainstream scientific understanding is that , in hindsight and on an ongoing basis its predictions fall wide of the mark . The discovery of shared pseudogenes should have been all but impossible , as should identically located retroviral insertions . We should not have found fossils at all , let alone a nested hierarchy of forms . We should not have been able to observe evolution and speciation . We should not have been able to see very distant stars and galaxies . All of these unexpected face-plants for Creationism have of course been rationalised away after the fact . Shared pseudogenes must all have some function we do n't know about ; there must be some determinism in the location of ERVs ; fossils and the geological column were all laid down in the Great Flood ; the speed of light and the rate of decay of radioactive materials were different in the past . But these rationalisations entail further predictions : we ought not to be able to safely remove pseudogenes if they are functional - but we can . If ERV insertion is deterministic we should see that in the lab - but we do n't . If fossils were laid down by the flood we would n't expect similar animals to be sorted by depth according to the number of cusps on a back tooth , or to be buried in amongst consistent strata of pollen grains , and we would n't expect there to be anything like as much limestone . If decay rates had been high enough in the past to explain what we see today in just 10,000 years , we ought to now be breathing incandescent rock vapour instead of air . And so on . Science also changes to accommodate the unexpected - but as often as not the 'unexpected ' has been discovered by scientists extrapolating existing theories to their logical conclusions , predicting something we did n't initially suspect but which has later been confirmed . And that 's the bottom line : Creationism and science both evolve as new facts emerge , but while the result for science has been a trend towards better and more accurate predictions , indicative of closing the gap between theory and reality , Creationism remains a tumbling snowball of post-hoc rationalisation growing around a hard core of sacred axioms that - it would certainly appear thus far - make it impossible for the convergence of prediction and reality to occur .
All born children , and every woman had the right to be rid of them . Killing them is not required as abortion is when they are in the womb ( during the timeframe the majority of abortions occur , at least ) . They are not comparable .
Well , we should both agree that first off the generally public does n't exactly know what it thinks a lot of the time . To be honest , this poll question worked perfectly . It shows people just do n't really know the subject very well . You are right in being confused about second trimester abortions ... I mean if you are worried about it being a valued creature then what changed ? You could probably ask why and give some possible answers and then after that follow up with exemptions and then follow up with certain examples to see where they would come out on . I think what you would find would be a public that does n't think anything through and works on a gut feeling of what they would want . For example , if you asked `` would you allow abortions in the 2nd trimester even if the woman was struggling in college '' then you 'd probably get 60 % of people to say they would allow it . If you asked it `` would you allow abortions in the 2nd trimester as a form of birth control '' then you 'd probably get 60 % saying no or more . The question is ... why is the value placed on the unborn different based on the situation of another ? Seems crazy to me . The only two positions on abortion that make any sense and are even remotely consistent are your opinion and mine . These exceptions for rape , health , etc etc are just weird and inconsistent with itself .
So how is misuse of science a valid argument against the correct application of the scientific method ? Hitler also claimed he was doing his Christian duty . He admired Martin Luther very much . If you 're going to ride the Nazi horse , you ca n't leave the head behind and just be the horses XXX .
Those quotes have nothing to do with abortion . This one has to do with babys in the woumb `` Befor I formmed you in the woumb , I knew you , and before you were born I consecrated you ; I appointed you a prophet amoungst nations '' Jeremiah 1:4-5 I think this is rellavent because God wants everyone to be a prophet who he can work through .
and
And just how are the criminals and terroists to be kept from entering a school while armed ? Airplanes , probably with some of the new technology , but schools , or bars , or post offices , or government buildings ? Just a law that says it is illegal , surely is not going to work .
Wait a second . What if it is by reason of genetic instability that the baby miscarries ? Then , by your standards , this would be deemed as suicide . Check it out , another way for insurance companies to save money . They would n't have to pay for the ensuing DNC 's or follow up visits . Because suicide is not covered by insurance . Dang , I 'd be in debt up to my eyebrows . My wife has had 4 extremely emotional miscarriages . Thank God , that Symbiote is only joking .
Because Apes , monkeys and chimps are on different paths . You would n't expect a shark to evolve into a barracuda-like animal . things evolve to fill niches , we currently fill a niche , there is nothing pushing apes , chimps or other primates to fill a niche that is occupied .
So the bishops finally did it . They 've been threatening to do that for years . Well , I guess it 's time to yank their tax-exempt status from them . We could definitely use the money to pay for health care and rebuilding our nation 's Bush-destroyed infrastructure .
Sex offenders who rape and kill children are required to be photographed and fingerprinted . Why are you in favor of people exercising a constitutional right , being treated in the exact same way ? I ca n't see any type of measurable affect photographing and fingerprinting gun owners would have on fighting crime . We know that criminals wo n't submit to registration , they 're not permitted to own or possess guns under any circumstances , etc . To me this seems more about the regulation of a constitutional right and the harassment of honest gun owners than anything else .
Well you have n't proven that you do n't support the idea of a dictatorship .
The original statement did n't address anything about the difference between a pre-birth and post-birth human . It was a reasonable statement that suggested that no human being should be discriminated because of their place of residence . I asked whether you really disagreed with the statement , and you respond here with your opinion on the matter of a difference between a pre-birth and post-birth human and the semantics of the word 'reside . ' Your first opinion I can accept as your opinion , you are entitled to it . Your second statement can be taken to mean that someone in a coma on life support is not 'residing ' in the hospital room on the bed linked to life-support equipment , but rather that they are physically attached to it for their very survival . Or that an Eskimo is not 'residing ' in an igloo in the Arctic with -60F temps and windchills of over 100F below zero ... but that they are attached to that igloo for their very survival . ( Granted , the igloo example is a bit of a stretch , but I just wanted to take an opportunity to say that I built an igloo in my backyard . It 's pretty cool ! )
This is a false dichotomy . We are limited by the English language on this subject as `` beginning '' , `` before '' etc all reference time . Time is just a dimension of space-time however , thus something could have existed `` before '' ( in a non-time sense ) the beginning of space-time . So we might have had an absolute beginning , a partial beginning , or no beginning .
I ca n't help but wonder if current majority public sentiment against alternative lifestyles , and other change , is n't a portion of widespread fear as that public experiences declines in standards of living , an ongoing threat of Islamic extremist attacks and other social changes that further threaten their status quo . Change is not something eagerly embraced by a majority of the general public under normal circumstances , actually quite the opposite , and these trying times would increase their desire to hold established values representing better times in a higher light than if times were prosperous and stable . Most arguments against alternative lifestyles that I 've read are mythological belief system based and present more of a position against the unknown , adherence to parameters established by that belief system , than any disruption of society . Sort of a 'no atheists in foxholes ' wartime crowd mentality as versus live and let live if a change presents no threat to the individual ( believer ) in better times .
How is that related to deterrence ? Once again , deterrence is preventing through the fear of consequences . What you are talking about is not related to the subject of deterrence .
Yeah . The natural fission reaction is really interesting , I had n't heard about it . nifty link : http : //www.curtin.edu.au/curtin/cent ... LO/index.shtml
You misunderstand me I believe they should all be locked up . Anyone who preaches against gay people freely living their lives as equal citizens with all the rights and responsibilites should be locked up in the darkest dungeon . There can be no compromise on this issue peoples lives are at stake .
Because the purpose of the US Bill of Rights is to grant or guarantee rights , not to prohibit or curtail personal freedoms .
This is a much poorer analogy than mine could possibly be . If drunk driving were legal and did n't affect anyone outside the driver 's body it could be analogous . If drunk driving did not affect anyone outside the driver 's body , I would agree that they probably should have the freedom to do so if they so choose ( even if I personally disagreed ) . However , the reason drunk driving is illegal is that it endangers everyone on the road around the driver .
What 's that ? `` Wild west ! Wild west ! `` ? But I digress ... You appear to be exaggerating my position , exactly as I suggested a pro-gunner would likely do ; in my very first post in this thread . The fact that guns do n't trigger aggressiveness to the extent you exaggerate does n't change the fact that they do increase it by a measurable amount .
so a 200,000 or 20 % decrease in abortions happened because abortion became legal ? Where is your rocket-science skills on that one ? Aside from the actual numbers not being known , the experts still state that it probably was n't as high as many abortions activists claim . http : //www.forerunner.com/forerunner ... thout_Roe.html
That definition is n't what I 'm disagreeing with I 'm just pointing out why it 's not happening here . Retroviruses , as I said , open up some very interesting possibilities . I 'm not aware of any conclusive research taking place - I know the immune system makes use of them but I do n't think there 's any evidence of immunity being passed down in that way : early mothers ' milk is the mechanism for that ( packed with a payload of antibodies to prime the infant 's immune system ) . To be honest , I think the existence of that system rather stomps on the plausibility of Lamarckian inheritance ; why bother going to all that trouble if the parent could simply code immunity into the genes it passes to its offspring ?
Very well said , but remember , Evolution doesnt mean atheism , but creationism means religion . I know Christians that believe in evolution , but i dont know atheists that believe in creationism .
So the fact that terrorists board airplanes should be used against people in determining whether they can be trusted or not ? My government must not trust an ordinary dirtbag like me because it makes me go through a security check before boarding a plane .
Often that screen name is taken-Peddler-out of habit I attach a number to it .
Again you focus on irrelevant minutia in the hope of making excuses and justifying the actions of someone who was clearly in the wrong . Here again is what the Judges said in their ruling , one being a fellow woman whom you are calling a racist , and it does n't bode well for your law suit partial criminal : But in a 2-1 ruling Friday , a panel of the 9th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed . Judges Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain held that the officers were justified in making an arrest because Brooks was obstructing them and resisting arrest . The use of force was also justified because of the threat Brooks posed , Hall wrote : `` It seems clear that Brooks was not going to be able to harm anyone with her car at a moment 's notice . Nonetheless , some threat she might retrieve the keys and drive off erratically remained , particularly given her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation . ''

So what if he dislikes science ? If he believes something else , he has the right to believe that way . My problem here is that he shows more closed-mindedness to the viewpoints of others .
Really . Some people would think I 'm in cahoots with the creationists . I predict their behavior and then they go and do it .
You do n't seem to understand the concept of overpopulation .
Now read it again and do n't make a conclusion before you finish this time . He states genetics as a cause twice both times he is quoting a source . The first is the subject of the article the second is a poll . As part of the poll he states conservatives do n't accept the liberal opinion for genetics but believe the choice theory which has been discredited . Scientist may not know without a doubt what causes someone to be gay , but they know without a doubt it is not a choice . By all means , do n't try to redefine marriage and the problem is solved .
This is n't discrimination because the adult once did have have the right to live in a womb until it could live otherwise . Once out of the womb and living on his/her own this right has been exhausted because there is no need to be living in the womb . Much like you can drive but this 'right ' is exhausted when you are drunk or too old to see anything .
Did you notice the word `` tend '' in there ? Humans ( in general ) are actually very careful about protecting their young . Many organisms just produce a few thousand offspring and leave . Obviously , all of those offspring can not survive .
Not being able to change something would be an indication of not being omnipotent . Here is another example of your inadequacies .
Yep . ( I 'm assuming that by `` belief system '' , you mean a methodology of gaining knowledge ) Science depends on evidence . I have to use a different belief system for understanding the supernatural , of course . Both belief systems are valid in their proper places .
there is no doubt the human body is all about manifestation of energy , not just electrical . just saying `` hi '' is creating sound energy through the kinetic energy of your jaw muscles , lung and vocal cords , which was converted from the chemical energy stored in the food you ate . but proving that energy occurs in the human body does not address the question of life itself . If life itself is a form of energy , then it must either be constant at all times ( ie , can not be created or destroyed ) . Or , it can be converted from one form to another . or both ...
You mean like Eclipses . Oh wait . That was a miracle explained by Science !
Well , thanks for clearing that up King of the Geeks
Let 's hear more . Remember ; it is estimated that over 6 billion people were on earth at the time of the flood . Also , Genesis 1 : 6 thru 1 : 10 - Water was above and below the firmament of Heaven . What happened to the waters that were above the firmament ? Was this used for the deluge that covered the earth ? It had never rained before The Flood . Why , if someone made up this story , would they have said such a thing ? Would n't it be much more believeable if they would have said , `` There had never been such a rain as this ... '' ?
I believe that science explains the way God created the universe .
Yes . It is also a classic example of a creationist straw man . It demonstrates that you have n't bothered to learn the most basic ideas of the topic and that you are willing to let some creationist hack dupe you . The methods of dating fossils was first developed by creationists when they discovered that certain suites of fossils were always found in the same order in geological strata . They reasoned that the deeper the fossils were , the older they were . Thus , they assigned relative ages to certain types of strata . Of course , their estimates of actual age were way off , since they thought that the earth was only a few million years old . We now have several methods of radiometric dating and can more accurately determine the ages of fossils . The relative dating methods of the creationist scientists has been confirmed - the dates are just older than they thought .
Funny but I doubt you could spin that past Jesse Jackson , Al Sharpton and others . You need only look at making institutions that were n't around at that time guilty of having slave owning roots by buying institutions that were . Having racist roots does not absolve the pro slavers or gun control fanatics of being racist . Rather the opposite I 'd say .
Gun registration schemes have been disabled for criminals because requiring them to register a gun they are forbidden to own would violate their 5th Amendment rights . I would assume that if ballistic fingerprinting ever became law , a form would be offered at time of sale where you would be required to waive any claim of 5th Amendment right injury from any governmental authority 's use of the ballistic data . Do n't sign the form - you do n't get the gun .
Oh so then Brady got it all wrong according to the VPC . Funny . Brady says the Brady laws are working quite well . Now they are asking me to trust them that they can make it all right ? What is going on here ? Because this VPC site says they are trying to renew the Brady bill : http : //www.banassaultweapons.org/ OK so if I understand this correctly , the VPC wants to renew a law that according to thier own literature is ineffective , not working , and full of holes ? If your anti-gunner , does this just strike you as wrong ?
In the theory of evolution , it all started with life . I know that you have been told that the big bang theory is part of evolution . It 's not . The word evolution means change . In some situations it still has a meaning that it had back in Victorian times . It meant change in a particular direction , as in stelar evolution - stars `` evolve '' in predictable ways . It also sometimes carries the connotation of progress . But none of these meanings are applicable to theories of biological evolution . There is no concept of purpose or direction to the word when used in a biological context . Here is a more precise definition of evolution : evolution is a change in the heritable characteristics of a population of living organisms over generations . When scientist or a knowledgable amateur speaks of the `` theory of evolution , '' it is this theory that is being discussed . Unmodified , the term has come to mean biological evolution . Those who include the big bang ( cosmological evolution ) or the formation , life and death of stars ( stelar evolution ) are either ignorant or dishonest . Even the question of the origin of life is irrelevant . One may postulate a magical , all powerful being that created the first life . The theories of evolution attempt to explain how life changes and has changed over time .
Not at all , I 'm simply forcing those making the argument to address the undeniable facts .
Well , I ca n't speak for anyone else , but I support any choice that the woman wants to make . No , I do n't support forced abortions anywhere , I do n't support what 's going on in China and India because they 're still taking a choice away from the women . What I do n't get is that many prolifers think that prochoicers are ONLY for the choice of abortion . All the prochoicers I know support any choice the woman feels right about making . For example , I was called a hypocrite because I 'm prochoice and pregnant . The person said `` You 're forcing others to abort while you carry to term . '' I have NEVER forced anyone to do anything , nor will I ever . I 've also never aborted ... and many prolifers automatically assume that if one is prochoice they 've aborted .
Except for possible exception of a couple evangelistic atheists , the design argument is from the creationist side . It is pretty old being first stated by William Paley . Darwin respected Paley and thought his arguments beautiful until he actually started looking at reality ( Darwin also lived in that same rooms at Christ 's College , Cambridge that Paley did ) . The argument from design is presented as `` proof '' of God or an `` intelligent '' designer for those who want to pretend that intelligent design creationism ins't creationism . But the argument on the other side is that it is flawed design and therefore is n't `` proof '' . Evolutionary biologists do n't assert that there is not god , only that there is no evidence from nature that there is one . Science is naturalistic . Even if some scientists ( and others ) are philosophical naturalists , science does n't work that way . It is methodological naturalism simply because there are no tools by which science can examine or quantify the supernatural . It sounds silly when some claim that scientists are wrong when they fail to consider the supernatural in naturalism .
Why do n't you take your own advice ? What would it take to change YOUR mind on abortion ? BTW , this , 'I said . `` I 'll chain you to the bed before I let you kill our child . '' ' from your post # 1 in this thread clearly indicates your true attitude . What kind of a man would chain a pregnant woman to a bed for the duration of a pregnancy ? Now , while you are asking others what would change their minds , the question of what it would take to change YOURS looms ever larger .
Hey that would be great . The law would FORCE all anti-gunners of military service age and ability to own a fully automatic rifle . The law would FORCE all anti-gunners to train with the weapon . The law would FORCE VOR to keep his rifle clean . Hey VOR how about it ? Keep your rifle clean or go to jail . I 'm not talking about my rifle , I 'll be glad to keep my free government rifle clean . How about you ?
Because you are disrupting social order and infringing on another person 's rights .
This is obviously not talking about abortion .
It depends on your intention and your methods . Of course , things that do n't have some sort of physical manifestation that can be measured ca n't be studied by science . Science is naturalistic . Scientific data can only include that which can be observed and quantified by natural means . I read it in a book of mythology is n't scientific .
Very weak analogies . Your position has been that 'mechanistic ' models of DNA expression are fundamentally wrong . The success of genetic modification ( of bacteria and of eukaryotic organisms ) provides strong support for their being fundamentally sound . But wabbit , how come I 'm privileged with a reply ? I thought I was on ignore , along with anyone else who knows what they 're talking about .
So Marc , you going to even bother to try ?
Your implication that dropping crime rates has anything to do with the AWB ... .
More people actuallysupport the FSM school of creationsim - would you agree that this could be a suitable compromise ?
No you can prevent the life of the unborn because they are not living but I do n't think you should end the life of the born .
Of course . Afterall , this is the internet ...
Please read carefully . He was talking about the US population , not the world . The initial post was NOT detailing population control but bringing up the issue of resource allocation and parenting .
Bad Religion or misapplied Religion has been in every century , country and culture .
21st Century cause and effect is not something those desiring adhesion to 2000-year mythical belief systems are prepared to accept . As a current example displaying what will happen with outlawing abortion , I offer over-the-counter cough medicine used as a ingredient in cooking crystal meth , the ( US ) current street drug of choice . Sales of that simple ingredient were banned in my state by politicians claiming it would 'dry up ' meth production . No support whatsoever from LE due to the simple fact that cheap finished product from Canada and Mexico would simply flood the market , eliminating the need for local production , expand usage by increased availability and fill up our jails with the aftermath of crimes against property and people . Guess what ? That 's exactly what 's happening . Christian morality regarding abortion and drugs might be the predominate factor in many of our criminal statutes , but there 's certainly no doubt it 's a cost we can no longer afford on a social or financial basis .
GULLIBLE TREATMENT OF TRUMPED UP `` STUDY '' ON FETAL PAIN ISSUE SHOULD EMBARRASS J.A.M.A . AND SOME JOURNALISTS This memo offers a number of points of information regarding the article `` Fetal Pain : A Systematic Multidisciplinary Review of the Evidence , '' published in the August 24 edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) . Any of the material below , if not otherwise attributed , can be attributed to NRLC Legislative Director Douglas Johnson ( Legfederal @ aol.com ) , who prepared this memorandum . See this here : http : //www.nrlc.org/abortion/Fetal_P ... uttalJAMA.html The following excerpt is from : http : //abort73.com/HTML/I-A-2a-pain.html `` Sir Albert Lilley , widely considered the `` Father of Fetology '' , and unabashedly pro-life ( as anyone with his vast knowledge of fetal development should be ) makes some remarkable statements about fetal pain in an interview he conducted for the book The Tiniest Humans . Question : In the case of an 8- to-10-week fetus , if you apply pressure will it tend to try to get out of the way ? Answer : Normally it would be extremely difficult , apart from putting a foreign instrument or needle into the uterus to apply pressure , but with a fetus at that maturity you have a very small fetus in a larger capsule of fluid . However , as the famous work of Dr. Davenport Hooker shows , in his many thousands of feet of film , babies at this maturity are responsive to touch . The fetus also responds violently to painful stimuli-needle puncture and injection of cold or of hypertonic solutions- stimuli which you and I find painful , children will tell you are painful , and the neonate , to judge from his responses , finds painful . -- - I have been told by advocates of abortion that we have no proof that the fetus actually feels pain . Strictly , they are quite correct . Pain is a peculiarly personal and subjective experience and there is no biochemical or physiological test we can do to tell that anyone is in pain - a phenomenon which makes it very easy to bear other people 's pain stoically , which is an important point for obstetricians to remember . By the same token we lack any proof that animals feel pain . However , to judge from their responses , it seems charitable to assume they do . Were this not so there would be no point in having an organization like the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , and I for one would be unhappy to think we would withhold from the human fetus a charitable consideration we were prepared to extend to animals . Question : The question , then , of pain felt by the fetus - it is your personal opinion , I gather from what you say in your paper , that in effect the fetus does feel pain ? Answer : I can only say that the fetus responds violently to stimuli that you and I would find painful . Bertrand Russell once remarked that a fisherman had told him that fish had neither sense or sensation , but how he knew that the fisherman would not tell him . '' The following excerpt is from : http : //www.theinterim.com/2000/nov/21fetalpain.html `` Dr. Glover 's research in the area of fetal pain is hardly groundbreaking . Sir Albert W. Liley , the pre-eminent fetologist from New Zealand , had no doubt , on the basis of objective evidence , that the fetus has a capacity to feel pain . In 1963 , Dr. Liley , the founder of fetology , developed the first surgical technique for administering intrauterine blood transfusions to the fetus . According to Liley , the fetus feels pain as early as three months . In offering instructions for carrying out the surgical technique of fetal blood transfusions , he advised his colleagues to take into serious consideration this fact of fetal pain . During the actual surgical procedure , the child must be sedated and given pain-relieving medication . Dr. Margaret Liley , wife and assistant to her husband , and a distinguished fetologist and pediatrician in her own right , remarks in her well-known book , Modern Motherhood : When doctors first began invading the sanctuary of the womb , they did not know that the unborn baby would react to pain in the same fashion as a child would . But they soon learned that he would . By no means a vegetable ' as he has so often been pictured , the unborn knows perfectly well when he has been hurt , and he will protest it just as violently as would a baby in a crib . In referring to aborting a 12-week-old fetus by dilatation and curettage , ( in which the neck of the womb is dilated and the fetus removed in pieces after the womb has been scraped by a sharp instrument called a curette ) , Dr. Eugene Diamond stated in 1971 : `` When this procedure is done , there is little doubt that the fetus , in fact , feels what is done to it . '' In a comprehensive treatment of fetal pain , published in 1985 in the New England Journal of Medicine , Dr. K. Annand , a Harvard physiologist , stated that the fetus first perceives pain as early as 12 weeks . In a May 1975 piece in Atlantic , Willard Gaylin and Marc Lappe argue for fetal experimentation , which they contend is far less traumatic for the unborn than certain forms of abortion . If society allows a child in the womb to be subjected to `` unimaginable acts of violence , '' they write , such as `` dismemberment , salt-induced osmotic shock , or surgical extirpation , '' how can it balk at fetal experimentation , most forms of which are incomparably more benign . Fetal pain , of course , is a matter of fact , not ideology . Science , of course , should be based on fact , not political correctness . We live in a Therapeutic Culture in which popping pills has become a national pastime . We are only too sensitive about pain , inconvenience , and possibly offending someone . Yet our own ultra-sensitivity to pain does not , in general , extend to the unborn . Are we inconsistent in our war against pain ? Is there a blatant contradiction that runs through the very heart of our Therapeutic Culture ? The answer to this apparent dilemma lies in the fact that there are different levels of pain . Pain exists on a spiritual as well as on a physical level . Of the two , as many psychologists and psychiatrists have averred , the spiritual kind is more difficult to bear . The difference between the two is akin to the difference between pain and suffering . The suffering in one 's soul that can arise from humiliation , guilt , despair , and terror , are formidable . An athlete would rather risk breaking his neck driving for a fly ball than feel the humiliation of being called a wimp . A soldier would rather risk injury and even death , than suffer the shame of dishonor . A Christian would rather mortify himself than experience the disgrace that comes with mortal sin . Defeat , dishonor , disgrace , as a rule , are far more devastating than physical pain . There is a pain that goes with being egregiously wrong ( shame ) or being recklessly immoral ( disgrace ) or being purposely obtuse ( humiliation ) that is more acute than physical pain . Our Therapeutic Culture is not inconsistent . Those who promote abortion want to spare themselves the pain that goes with suffering shame , disgrace , and humiliation . Because of that , they are willing to deny the pain that the aborted baby feels . To acknowledge what abortion really means is too painful for them . They would rather retreat into the presumed security of their comforting ideology . Pain and birth go together in a mysterious way , like death and life , fall and redemption . The birth of a child or the rebirth of an adult requires a certain amount of pain . Birth and redemption both demand pain . Abortion was instituted in an attempt to avoid pain . But it has magnified the very thing it had sought to reduce . We are drowning in a sea of tranquilizers while we increase our suffering . We thought we could eliminate physical suffering , but brought about spiritual torment . The abortion issue , like an ellipse , has two foci : one is the birth of the child ( which is accompanied by pain ) ; the other , the rebirth of the pro-abortionist ( which is accompanied by suffering ) . Part of the painful truth about the abortion issue is that it includes both the unborn and the unrepentant .

The temperature increase will hamper growth about as much as the CO2 increase will help it . Looking at it from an economic perspective climate change on the scale that the greenhouse effect is causing will do nothing good .
By which divine entity ?
Or in any culture . Women abort WORLDWIDE you know jyoshu . For what it 's worth , I certainly AM bothered by this if it 's true . I 'd like to see the source where you got that information about the abortion rate climbing under Bush 's presidency , if you would . http : //www.nytimes.com/2004/10/30/op ... d % 2fColumnists ( sorry about the long address - also you may need to register , but it 's free ) and an interesting article on http : //www.myrtlebeachonline.com/mld ... on/9924004.htm
It 's been reported in the Telegraph as well as several other news outlets . Want to slander them as well or do you want to try to disprove their story based on its content . I suggest the former , because the University has already confirmed the authenticity of the e-mails and documents .
No , you would n't have . I 'd have a better chance of winning the lottery without buying a ticket .
Does n't matter if it is 5 months or 8 months ( all of which is done ) or 1 month ... it is a person inside another ... why does that make a difference ? I suppose you are a `` cancer '' too ? So I guess we assume you comment should read `` Her body her choice so long as she is not inside another person and none of anyone elses business . '' Surely is a random thought but I would like to have one of my own . I think that if I kill someone else in my own home then it is no one elses business but my own . Sound weird ? ? I agree ... just like your statement .
The VAST majority of abortions are performed within the first trimester . When they are performed in the second trimester it 's a serious procedure for the mother to go through , and is something she obviously would n't go into lightly . Her reasons for choosing an abortion as late as that would have to far outweigh anything else , and she would need consent from two doctors to go ahead with it . Basically what I 'm trying to say is something like the foetus being developed enough to feel pain would not change the mind of a woman who had just found out she was pregnant and she 'd been raped , or was going through something you ca n't understand . For an abortion that late she 'd have to deliver the foetus anyway , which is traumatising enough .
Then why does the NRA use that quote at this link ? http : //www.nraila.org/Issues/FactShe ... ad.aspx ? ID=108
Really ? She was taken to two different hospitals and an ICU , and she still died ? Health care has nothing to do with it . This seems like a desperate cry to change , but not unfair government work . SHE WAS GOING TO DIE REGARDLESS ! This had nothing to do with being treated unfairly , but it had everything to do with a sob case that was misstated , and uncharged . It does n't make sense , and unless it 's changed , I do n't think that it ever will .
It has a chance . Any scientist has the opportunity to study ID . We are discussing the science classroom . We already teach it as a hypothesis in most schools . But it simply should not be taught as a valid alternative to evolution . That 's what this debate is over .
So joining the Brady Campaign is deceitful ?
Actually it seems you are the one that is sick . You have this obsession with what others do with their sex life and want the government to try and prevent any kind of sex you dont approve of . It looks like you are trying hard to repress homosexual desires you have . Otherwise why do you care what others do when it doesnt affect you ? I 'm not for or against what other adults do with their consentual sex life . It 's none of my business .
When someone lacks the ability to understand and the ganas to try , then it does n't make sense . However , if you understood any of it , it would be different . After all , you repeat over and over again how you do n't understand .
These `` darwinists '' are figments of your imagination , there is no serious scientist in any evolution related field that denies the influence of the environment on behaviour , and at least in more complex organisms , the ability to learn . Nice strawman argument though , just keep imagining stupid things for your opponents to believe .
You 're missing the point . The ghetto resistance was drastically outmanned and outgunned , and it still took the professional , well armed German military , nearly a month to beat them down into defeat .
Not all `` orgnansims '' are able to breed . Some are sterile ( mules or ones with mutations ) , some die in the `` lottery '' ( which is biased against certain traits ) , and some simply breed less ( those who ca n't get as much food , for example ) .
Evidence of this ?
And we have an emotional post with no substance whatsoever . I 'm sure your twin will be checking in soon . I think I 'll keep a count of this type of post .
According to Genesis ? Why are you trying to present that as scientific evidence ? Should I present The DaVinci Code as scientific evidence ? How about Darwin 's On the Origin of the Species ?
Because taking responsibility for ones own safety is certainly a sissy thing to do ? ? ?
That restriction was implemented by your people back in 1968 with the Gun Control Act . You 're at fault here .
Are you actually suggesting that McIntyre and McKitrick are the only voices which oppose the fraud of man made global warming ? How about the actual scientists who reject the media promotion of this issue ? Here 's an excerpt : Climatologists Reject Media Claims of Global Warming Consensus `` [ i ] n November 2004 , German climatologist Hans von Storch , director of the GKSS Institute for Coastal Research ( IfK ) in Geesthacht , Germany , foresaw that claims of alarmist consensus would be made by nonscientists ... '' Environment & amp ; Climate News > August 2005 Environment Environment > Climate : Consensus Email a Friend Written By : Alan Caruba Published In : Environment & amp ; Climate News > August 2005 Publication date : 08/01/2005 Publisher : The Heartland Institute Leading climatologists spent the month of June fighting false proclamations from non-scientists claiming scientists have reached agreement that catastrophic global warming is occurring . Alarmists Claim Debate Over On June 1 , California Gov . Arnold Schwarzenegger ( R ) claimed `` the debate is over '' and global warming alarmists ' predictions had carried the day . The Natural Resources Defense Council on June 9 declared , `` The world 's leading scientists now agree that global warming is real and is happening right now . According to their forecasts , extreme changes in climate could produce a future in which erratic and chaotic weather , melting ice caps and rising sea levels usher in an era of drought , crop failure , famine , flood and mass extinctions . '' On June 13 , USA Today declared , `` The debate 's over : Globe is Warming . '' In support of its claim , the newspaper cited the positions of some left-leaning religious groups , some corporations who will reap a financial windfall from a switch to alternative fuel sources , and some politicians . Scientists Disagree While each of the above claims from non-scientists received significant media coverage , leading climatologists spent the month of June rebutting such proclamations . Atmospheric physicist S. Fred Singer , professor emeritus of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and former director of the U.S . Weather Satellite Service , sent a letter to the editor of USA Today directly refuting its claim . `` Your editorial ... claim [ s ] the global warming debate is over . Not so , '' wrote Singer . Singer wrote , `` Sea level will continue to rise by only seven inches per century as it has for thousands of years no matter what we do or what the EPA [ U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ] says . And temperatures in the next 100 years will likely rise by less than one degree F -- not exactly a catastrophe . '' Added Singer in a subsequent letter to the Canadian media , `` Thousands of scientists from many countries now fully understand that Kyoto and other efforts to control human emissions of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) are ineffective and entirely unfounded scientifically . `` Even if you ignore the enormous cost of Kyoto ( estimated recently by Prof. George Taylor of Oregon State University -- see http : //www.sitewave.net/news/s49p628.htm -- at one trillion U.S. dollars a year for full implementation in OECD countries ) , climate science research is rapidly moving AWAY from the hypothesis that the human release of greenhouse gases , specifically CO2 , is in any way significantly contributing to global climate change . '' Sun Called Primary Cause `` If we just look at the historical data , there is a scientific consensus that the global mean temperature has risen modestly during the twentieth century , '' said Myron Ebell , director of global warming and environmental policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute . `` The impacts have been small and probably beneficial in aggregate . This historical data puts the onus of demonstration on those who think this gradual warming trend will accelerate and lead to dire consequences . '' The controlling driver of global temperature fluctuations , according to Dr. Benny Peiser of England 's John Moore 's University , is solar ray activity . `` Six eminent researchers from the Russian Academy of Science and the Israel Space Agency have just published a startling paper in one of the world 's leading space science journals . The team of solar physicists claims to have come up with compelling evidence that changes in cosmic ray intensity and variations in solar activity have been driving much of the Earth 's climate , '' Peiser was quoted as saying in the May 17 National Post . Moreover , reports Peiser , Jan Veizer , one of Canada 's top earth scientists , published a comprehensive review of recent findings and concluded , `` empirical observations on all time scales point to celestial phenomena as the principal driver of climate , with greenhouse gases acting only as potential amplifiers . '' Added Peiser , `` In fact , the explicit and implicit rejection of the 'consensus ' is not restricted to individual scientists . It also includes distinguished scientific organizations such as the Russian Academy of Science and the U.S. Association of State Climatologists , both of which are highly skeptical of the whole idea . `` Heartland Institute - Article And here 's more : Renowned Scientist Defects From Belief in Global Warming  Caps Year of Vindication for Skeptics October 17 , 2006 October 17 , 2006 Washington DC - One of the most decorated French geophysicists has converted from a believer in manmade catastrophic global warming to a climate skeptic . This latest defector from the global warming camp caps a year in which numerous scientific studies have bolstered the claims of climate skeptics . Scientific studies that debunk the dire predictions of human-caused global warming have continued to accumulate and many believe the new science is shattering the media-promoted scientific consensus on climate alarmism . Claude Allegre , a former government official and an active member of Frances Socialist Party , wrote an editorial on September 21 , 2006 in the French newspaper L'Express titled The Snows of Kilimanjaro ( For English Translation , click here : U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works ) detailing his newfound skepticism about manmade global warming . See : http : //www.lexpress.fr/idees/tribune ... asp ? ida=451670 Allegre wrote that the cause of climate change remains unknown and pointed out that Kilimanjaro is not losing snow due to global warming , but to local land use and precipitation changes . Allegre also pointed out that studies show that Antarctic snowfall rate has been stable over the past 30 years and the continent is actually gaining ice . Following the month of August experienced by the northern half of France , the prophets of doom of global warming will have a lot on their plate in order to make our fellow countrymen swallow their certitudes ,  Allegre wrote . He also accused proponents of manmade catastrophic global warming of being motivated by money , noting that the ecology of helpless protesting has become a very lucrative business for some people !  Allegre , a member of both the French and U.S. Academy of Sciences , had previously expressed concern about manmade global warming . `` By burning fossil fuels , man enhanced the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which has raised the global mean temperature by half a degree in the last century , '' Allegre wrote 20 years ago . In addition , Allegre was one of 1500 scientists who signed a November 18 , 1992 letter titled World Scientists ' Warning to Humanity in which the scientists warned that global warmings potential risks are very great. See : Warning to Humanity Allegre has authored more than 100 scientific articles , written 11 books and received numerous scientific awards including the Goldschmidt Medal from the Geochemical Society of the United States . Allegre 's conversion to a climate skeptic comes at a time when global warming alarmists have insisted that there is a consensus about manmade global warming . Proponents of global warming have ratcheted up the level of rhetoric on climate skeptics recently . An environmental magazine in September called for Nuremberg-style trials for global warming skeptics and CBS News 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley compared skeptics to Holocaust deniers. See : U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works & amp ; Scott Pelley And Catherine Herrick On Global Warming Coverage - Public Eye In addition , former Vice President Al Gore has repeatedly referred to skeptics as `` global warming deniers . '' This increase in rhetorical flourish comes at a time when new climate science research continues to unravel the global warming alarmists computer model predictions of future climatic doom and vindicate skeptics . 60 Scientists Debunk Global Warming Fears Earlier this year , a group of prominent scientists came forward to question the so-called consensus that the Earth faces a climate emergency. On April 6 , 2006 , 60 scientists wrote a letter to the Canadian Prime Minister asserting that the science is deteriorating from underneath global warming alarmists . Observational evidence does not support today 's computer climate models , so there is little reason to trust model predictions of the future Significant [ scientific ] advances have been made since the [ Kyoto ] protocol was created , many of which are taking us away from a concern about increasing greenhouse gases . If , back in the mid-1990s , we knew what we know today about climate , Kyoto would almost certainly not exist , because we would have concluded it was not necessary ,  the 60 scientists wrote . See : Open Kyoto to debate It was only 30 years ago that many of today 's global-warming alarmists were telling us that the world was in the midst of a global-cooling catastrophe . But the science continued to evolve , and still does , even though so many choose to ignore it when it does not fit with predetermined political agendas ,  the 60 scientists concluded.. : U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works : : Press Room : . So in conclusion , as the alleged science of evolution is based solely on pre-determined assumptions , so is the myth of Global Warming .
So if we were to actually do a true compromise , and not a Constitutional Compromise with the 2nd Amendment haters , most of all of this above would have to go ! However , that is NOT at all what THEY mean ! What they mean give me half of the Constitutionally Recognized as protected Inalienable Rights they have not taken from you yet ! Then after you have done the reasonable thing , ( In their reckless unconstitutional minds ) then they will ask you to compromise yet again , and again , and again , and again , and again and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again . Well , you get the picture !

Last time I checked most state boards merely set the guidelines , whether or not they are followed is something entirely different . Still the fact that you have a board of education spouting such ridiculousness is pretty damn amusing .
Actually , it 's not . Mutations are random . Selection is differential reproductive success .
Try going to a concert , party , club , and see if the guy selling weed is on the opposite end of the guy selling coke ... .doubtful ( unless it is second hand ) as weed has no real value compared to coke and what not . The whole leads to something for a better high is pretty dependable..many crack heads will tell you that they wanted a better high but that does n't mean every pot head will go to crack . HBO had a good special about this some time back .
Well , scientists in the appropriate fields of science are working on that . I 'm not a cosmologist so I rely on scientists in those fields to research those questions . I 'm a biologist . I deal with questions of biology , that is living organisms . That is why I am concerned with how living organisms change through time . In other words , that is why I am concerned with evolution . While physicists , cosmologists , geologists and so on may accept evolutionary theory , that does n't mean that their fields of science are `` evolution . ''
That is the apex of your understanding and 'uneducated ' assessment rolled up in a one liner . Proof that you again have nothing relevent to say . Instead of a troll , you surely must be designated a hobbit . Once you got past the stage of beating things with stone tools , you regressed once again to your true level of incompetence and incontinence . Perhaps you should follow your own advice you keep philandering on the board without rhyme nor reason , holding the mirror up and full of sound and fury ... signifying NOTHING . Is that yet another of your famouse `` strawmen '' filled with red herrings ? Poor insignificant creature that you are living in a failed state which you call civilized measured by your loss of rights just as any other gun grabber anti-Constitutionalist .
Actually , no . I do n't care why he 's against gay marriage . Pragmatically , what does it benefit to know ? You keep trying to make an issue over why quizzing Palin and not Biden . Biden 's position is plain . I do n't see any confusion on it . A while back another poster on another forum argued with me that Palin was not against gays . That she was supportive . I do n't see it . Last night she had a chance to clarify , but she chose not to . Her response was thoroughly devoid of any useful information , except to show me that she is n't the biggest anti-gay advocate I could imagine , and that she is against gay marriage which I already knew . Palin had a chance last night to help eliminate any confusion on her position . She chose not to . I do n't see any confusion on Biden 's position . While it 's not what I would ultimately want , it 's the best option out there in this presidential race .
Mach , Let me first say that you may be dealing more with chicken brains than in chicken guts in light of your most recent post . But if you can find in reading chicken guts , the richness and depth of thought that you find in the Catholic Church , then you are indeed a powerful mystic and soothsayer . The Church and its priests do not seek to erase the love and sexual feelings that men naturally have toward women ( in your words they do not seek to act like they do n't `` want some '' ) . They seek to control them and sacrifice them for a higher love . They are not pretending that they do not exist . If they do n't then you are probably dealing with an unhealthy individual who may not be fit for the priesthood . Secondly , there is much basis to the Catholic Church 's teachings on celibacy . It is not without foundation . These are not made up laws with made up enforcement . Thirdly , if you believe celibacy to be related to the perversion of pedophilia then I have a few questions for you : Have you ever had thoughts of having sex with a child when you were in a celibate period in your life ? Would being in close proximity to children in a position of authority instigate in you inclinations to molest children ? If for some reason , your significant other died or lived but for health reasons could no longer have sex would you consider pedophilia as a normal sexual outlet/interaction ? If you were required to be celibate your entire life do you think that you would be attracted to children ? And if celibacy is the problem then why does pedophilia occur in Protestant congregations at a similar rate when the pastor is not required to be celibate ? Pedophilia is a perversion , a sickness , a disorder . It has little to do with celibacy .
Because you said so ? And wow ! I 've never seen so many fallacies in one thread . I 'll briefly point out the fallacy for each post : Post : 1 . A type of false dilemma 2 . Poisoning the Well and Ad Hominem 3 . Aside from being hearsay it is also a circumstantial ad hominem 4 . This is either hearsay or a false claim . 5 . This is n't a logical fallacy . Congrats . 6 . Same as 4 . This certainly is n't common knowledge and makes no sense anyway . 7 . Not a fallacy . Good job 8 . Classic Ad Hominem 9 . Not a fallacy . And yes , I am confused as well . Cyberateos is actually doing ok other than the first post 10 . Straw man ! A simone special ( an ad hominem attack right there by me ) 11 . Strawman , Appeal to Ridicule 12. circumstantial ad hominem 13 . ( my post ) This is just unrelated and therefore is a fallacy . Wow , only 2 out of 13 are not logical fallacies . This is terrible .
Well , evolution says that everything evolved over `` millions of years '' , correct ? Let 's say it takes a certain species 1 million years to evolve . That means that every 100 years of its `` evolving process '' we should be able to see 1,000 mutations ! In the last 100 years , what SPECIES have we seen evolve 1,000 times ? ( Into an entirely new species , no less . )
I would never think of telling you that you can not speak or express your most deeply ( or superficially ) held sentiments on any subject . There is even less of a chance that I would use a gun to threaten or coerce you into silence ( which would not be an exercise of the right to be armed ) ; your argument is nonsensical . I will however use the right of free speech to tell you that your beliefs are incompatible with the fundamental , unchangeable principles of the constitutional republic we now enjoy . Feel free to advance the proposition that the present system should be scrapped and a new one , founded on liberal `` values '' be established . That is the proper course of action , not eating the present system from the inside like a cancer , misrepresenting and perverting the principles it rests upon .
Moral : Do not feed the troll . He ca n't see beyond his preconceptions and wo n't understand what you say . You probably have better things to do .
It helps to know what a strawman is before you accuse someone of using it . Your argument is no different then the one I presented .
This statement is wrong . People from hundreds of years before Jesus was born prophesied that a baby would be born , in Bethlehem , of a virgin . There were over 50 more prophesies that were made about his life , and the sacrafice he made to pay for the sins of man , and the bigest one of all ... He completely fufilled scripture when he rose from the dead . These men were inspired by Jesus , God , how can you argue that he is not the christ ? The odds of one man filling all the prophesies is impossible . And these scriptures have been unchanged for the past 2000-2500 approx years ! Thats proof for me that Jesus existed and that he is God . PM me if you like .
Well , that 's a bald assertion , and although it may even be true , I can not accept it at face value . You 'll have to take little time and explain to a non-scientist , amateur ontologist , just what it is that you intend that we should understand from these words , and why we should accept that understanding as true .
Well if it 's so easy then how about you provide the names of the dealers who 're selling howitzers and anti-aircraft missiles and fragmentation grenades ? And while you 're at it , supply the names of the companies who 're making them in violation of the various federal restrictions .
Some people commit crimes on accident , some do it for revenge , some do it out of fear , and some do it for fun .
Well , that is obsurd and you know it yourself.. If you are going to make arguments , at least make ones that matter .
So then , are we to presume that you would favor the sale and distribution of , to take the worst possible example , kiddie porn with no restrictions ? After all , the First Amendment says `` Congress shall make NO LAW abridging freedom of the press . BTW , re . Texas v. Johnson : Is a flag burning speech , and where in the Constitution does it say so ? I agree with the decision , which simply goes to prove that even a blind Antonin can find a peanut now and then .
Cars are a privilege , your gun is n't . Show me evidence that would support the registration of your first amendment rights being constitutional .
BWAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAH . That 's good .
So much wrong with that sentence ( and I 'm ignoring the grammar ) Rights have very little to do with what one perceives to be their ( or society in general ) moral obligations . Rights are concepts that focus on the actions of government and in the case of the US Constitution , usually represent exceptions of powers never granted to the government . In other words , they are redundant prohibitions ( a fact which was a primary argument against adding a bill of rights to the constitution ) . And most egregious of all , liberty is not provided to you . Liberty is retained by citizens by not conferring to government every speck of sovereignty and self determination .
I know I know . Unless a woman is gestating or dieing she is being selfish .
And you just did what you chastise me for in your next sentence
Oh , well , then that settles the argument does n't it . It must be a person because she says so , now . Maybe she will change her mind again ?
The original molecule had some lipolytic function , but removing some amino acids from it , in the right place , made it fit better into the substrate , and thereby greatly increased its functionality . Barbarian observes : We thought it would take roughly a million years for bacteria to evolve enzymes capable of digesting nylon ( because the compound is so different than any they were able to digest ) but it took less than a century . .

Because marc has a tendency to be highly dishonest , not to mention a tendency to equate nonreligion/secularism with atheism , I think you should consider clarifying from the get-go that non-theism is not atheism .
You 're kidding , right ? You actually live in Kansas and you actually got yourself elected to a school board and you are unfamiliar with the efforts of creationists on the Kansas Board of Education to remove the teaching of evolution from the science standards ? You are telling a lie . Maybe you have been duped by creationists and do n't know that you are . A committee of 27 scientists and science educators was hired to rewrite the science standards . There were several drafts that were all presented to the board . When the final draft was presented , it was rejected and replaced by a version that had been put together by a YEC ( a geocentrist no less ) from Missouri . The adopted standards did not increase the evolutionary curriculum . The standards very clearly touted YEC ideas , barely mentioned even macro-evolution , and removed all references to the age of the earth and the universe . I know that sounds stupid , but then I do n't live in Kansas where school board members think that limiting mention of evolution to microevolution is smart . I read the proposed standards and the ones that were adopted . At the next election several creationists lost their seats , and the new school board threw out the `` new standards '' and adopted the version that had been written by the committee . Those standards probably actually did raise the levels of what was expected to be taught in Kansas schools from one of the worst in the nation to one of the best . You were aware that the Ford Foundation had funded a study of state science standards and Kansas had received an F. The creationist standards also received an F , and the standards written by the committee of scientists and educators received an A . You know , it almost would have been fun to be a biology teacher in Kansas when micro-evolution was OK and presentation of `` holes '' in the theory were required . I could have probably gone on for a week or two about the problems presented to the Biblical flood story from a biological standpoint . Noah 's flood requires macro-evolution . Not only that , it requires macro-evolution at rates that make the heads of evolutionary biologists spin . Just think - about 6 different species of horse , unknown numbers of cattle species , 36 different species of cat , twenty some species of the wolf/dog `` kind '' and so forth . What fun to be required to teach `` alternative '' theories in that case .

More irrational drivel , and have you forgotten that I am an arab ? A smaller minority in this country than blacks ? Yet you must play the race card and assume that because I oppose this criminal woman for threatening the life of her unborn child by actually holding her responsible for her own poor conduct that I am somehow a racist . Your argument is as pathetic as your character is found wanting , you immoral apologist for all that is wrong with this country .
Most scientists agree that there needs to be a sufficiently developed cerebral cortex in order for pain to be registered as such . The cerebral cortex is not sufficiently developed enough in the fetus to feel pain until roughly the start of the third trimester . Otherwise , the movements of an early fetus or embryo away from a stimulus are simply reflex action . Those of you who might have disected a frog in biology class in High School might have experienced it yourself when seeing the leg of a newly dead frog move under stimulus . For the novice , it may appear to be a reaction to a felt pain but it is not . Here is one link to a comprehensive study on fetal pain made by the American Medical Association : http : //jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/294/8/947

Behe is happy to think that it is the christian god ( like the rest of them ) , but they ar n't allowed to say that , because if they do , they violate that annoying ammendment ! The ID argument is not scientific , because it 's not falsifiable , and has no supporting evidence . The ID movement relies solely on LACK of evidence for evolution , which is complete bunk . Just because we do n't know yet , it does n't mean that godditit . ( Incedentally , most of Behe 's claims of `` Irreducible Complexity '' are already destroyed by science , as DamEtel will be more than happy to explain . )
But you see , for the materialist , there is no distinction between `` intelligence '' and `` the motion of physical particles in space '' , its not an either/or proposition - they may well say `` He scored 155 on the IQ test because he is intelligent ( by intelligent , meaning his brain has certain physical characteristics ) .
Well you 're right , the gay pride movement embodies counter-culturalism . It does n't take a rocket scientist to see that . In my opinion it 's another outgrowth of the sexual revolution taken to the extreme .
Frankly , that 's like saying `` You ca n't be Jewish , but you can pick any sect of Christianity you want to . You ca n't wear a star of david , but you can wear a cross . So that 's *equal* '' ... You 're saying we can marry HETEROSEXUALLY , so HOMOSEXUALS must pretend that 's equal ? ? ? Makes no sense ...
Well , maybe some people 's idea of Judeo-Christian . I know a lot of them got extremely angry when science showed that there are no biological human races . I 'm thinking you 're upset about what some people want to apply the new knowledge to do . Science is n't about application . Talk to doctors and engineers .
When it 's obviously a law that 's not unconstitutional , then it 's obvious the judge was biased in the ruling . A strict constitutionalist would never overturn a law like that , as the constitution does not define marriage .
No I did n't miss it , I was hoping you 'd actually put forward an argument against what I said , not what you think I said . See what I actually said was the tautology . Then make your argument . Note Post 30
And it ca n't be detected by mindless clutching at mythology .
Well , i guess that depends on your definition of intellectual . Rational judgement would put one down the path of pro-life , however , I must say there are plenty of people above me that I would call an intellectual before I call myself that . Justice Scalia comes to mind . And likewise , I would n't accuse you of being in the `` intellectual '' coloumn either .
That evolutionist call on the god of time and chance , The Almighty IT to explain what can not be observed or tested . Little insignificant changes turned fish into amphibians long ago and far far away .
You know , Philip Cook . The famous Anti-gun researcher .
Then better define your position .
It does , it treats them equally , it is you that discriminates .
Now I have to ask you Mr. and Ms America , Is it old Sarge and Tither the Criminals that you hope our gun laws , and our LEO 's will be working this hard to catch ?
Because absolute prohibition of a Constitutionally recognized and protected right , is n't constitutional under any circumstances . The whole argument amounts to saying that the First Amendment should n't stand in the way of banning books , newspapers , blogs , news broadcasts , and public assemblies .
And changing in about 50 years twice in the space of 150 years is even faster .
I have to ask , why do you think `` the flood mixed everything up '' is an answer to the question `` why are n't fossils all mixed up ? ''
So , the contents of the bloody remains in the bag are ok with you ?
Well , Mr Jack has already visited `` nature , red in tooth and claw '' , so I 'll not comment further . But as Mr Jack points out , if you were correct then it would n't be necessary to make your assertion . I think that you mistake the appearance of design for design .
Actually , it depends on what you are comparing and how you want to characterize certain phenomena . If you are comparing only coding sequence , then it is on the order of 99 % . If you are comparing coding and noncoding sequence , it is on the order of 97-98 % . If you consider indels not as one-time events that incorporate large-scale changes of sequence , but count the individual nuclotides within each indel , then it comes out to 94-95 % . What the creationists never seem to understand is that if you are goiong to adopt the comparison method in which indels are treated as colelctions of nuclotide changes rather than one-time events , ALL % similarities between ALL taxa will be lowered somewhat . This means that when they predictably trot out some bastardized version of Haldane 's dilemma claiming that the nmew lower similarity is even harder for evolution to explain , they do not realize how devastating this method of accounting is for creationism genetics . For now the 'increased dissimilarity ' has to be accounted for in the very short time frames allowed by biblically-constrained science - about 4,500 years instead of the hundreds of thousands or millions of years during which accumulations of DNA change can be accounted for . So desperate are they ro 'diss Darwin ' that they do n't recognize the problems their arguments cause for their own ideology . That or they do n't care .
I know that also . But it still doesn & # 8217 ; t say when a fetus becomes a human being . If God knew him two weeks before he was born , he would have known him in the womb . But for 8 ½ months he wouldn & # 8217 ; t have know him .
The god of Moses was a pretty nasty guy .
well i was downplaying your argument because really , pregnancy is not that demeaning to a womans body . ITS NATURAL ! OBESITY ISNT !
Wow , so Balrogs existed according to the Bible ? Whoda thunk .
A ) I 'm not a member there . And 2 ) have you ever whistled in the wind ? Why would I waste my time on a forum which specializes in promoting the evo lies and scientific distortions in order to defend their cult religion which seek to erase God from the equation regarding how we came to be ?
Because God is free to show grace to some and judgement to others . It is what makes Him God and we ca n't begin to understand His perspective . He is not obliged to explain His eternal perspective to us at all .
And there have been more cases of people being killed with knives than so called `` assault weapons '' . Your point is what ?
And
Oh ! Goody ! At last someone who wants to actually discuss evolution instead of mythology !
Well , then I 'd have to convert everest to kilometers . I live in the US . Metric is alien . haahh .
That 's obviously not what is said . The sun 's energy is not claimed to be a mechanism that makes order of disorder . What it does do is override the tendancy within the 2LoTD where total usable energy in a system decreases .
Well , the simplest explanation often proves to be correct . I could give you examples , but I 'm not sure you would pay attention . Just to show I 'm not bluffing : if you typed a paper while sleepy , went to bed , and woke up only to find errors in your paper , the best conclusion would be to assume that you made the mistakes , rather than that a hacker put them there . I expect that most times , there was no hacker . The explanation with fewer assumptions is more likely to be correct . However , having all the information is important . If you later find out that a computer genius was submitting a paper to a contest that you were submitting yours to and that most of the other papers involved had many errors , the likelyhood of a hacker goes up . Yes , I know that was a weird example . I only used it because there is someone who actually believes ( according to rinkworks.com ) that a hacker messes with her writing .
It 's not faith if it 's validated scientifically .
Of course not , nor did I intend to imply that they were . I merely suggest that an increase , through education , in awareness of the diversity of religious belief has led some to a fuzzy-minded many-paths mentality , some to the conclusion that if 99.99 % are wrong , there 's a strong probability they 're all wrong . There are lots of other positions .
It shot up as soon as Reagan launched his failed campaign of anti-sex education , cutting social services for the poor and destroying the US economy into a recession that favored the rich against the poor . Since social-economical reasons are often the reason why people have abortions it is no surprise we saw abortion sky-rocket under Reagans political atmosphere that was hostile to lower class families . If people were becoming more against abortion in the 90s then how can you explain Clintons popularity in winning two elections ? The a friendlier economic atmosphere , contraception education and relief from Reaganism helped reduce the abortion rate .
But most creationists are YECs . The word has taken on bad connotations so it sounds a bit sour to call a theistic evolutionist a `` creationist . '' The most usual use of the word is as the name of someone who believes that the Bible is literal , including creation in 6 days , Adam and Eve in a magic garden , and a global flood . Someone who relieves in God but recognizes that much of the Bible is composed of moral tales and the mythology of the ancient Hebrews is n't really a `` creationist . '' I guess we could run down the list of degrees of creationism from flat earth to theistic evolution if you want .
You said , just earlier , that a zygote 'has not yet had a chance to live ' . That 's pretty darn close . Forming life is not life . You have not presented any evidence that this is not the case - all you 've done is re-enforce your first part , that it becomes life .
Actually , the black morph was always dominant . Perhaps you do n't understand the meaning of the word dominant in biology . Perhaps that is why you talk nonsense . And why did you find it necessary to repeat what had already been said , and in fact what you had quoted ?
and then later back-peddled and dishonestly claimed that he did n't say it .
Then why are n't police armed exclusively with handguns ?
You nailed that one !
And you can bet dollars to donuts that the ACTUAL RESPONSE to this issue is never realistically addressed in this article ... Nope . So I 'll quote it here : The tension between the two hypotheses stems from the incorrect assumption that atmospheric gas concentrations in the past were the same as today . First , before the advent of abundant life the atmospheric oxygen concentrations were orders of magnitude lower than today . In the presence of oxygen methane breaks down to carbon dioxide , so in the absence of oxygen the methane concentration could be much larger than currently observed . Methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide , so the relative abundance of atmospheric methane throughout Earth 's history must be considered when modeling the temperature . Further , the inorganic version of the carbon cycle can be expected to provide negative feedback towards an Earth with liquid water . Carbon dissolved in liquid water can form carbonic acids , which can then interact with calcium to produce calcium carbonate . If rainfall were to cease and the oceans froze over , then this part of the inorganic carbon cycle would shut down . Periodic explosions from volcanoes would then cause a net increase in the atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane levels with no liquid water to absorb these emitted gases . Eventually the concentrations would become large enough that the surface temperature would rise due to the greenhouse effect . When the surface temperature became large enough for the oceans to melt and rainfall to resume the other half of the inorganic carbon cycle would turn on and moderate the greenhouse gas concentrations . http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faint_young_sun_paradox
Try this scenario . A 15 or 16 year old girl has her 18 year old boyfriend pick up the medication .
Because of massive cultural differences . You might as well be asking `` if both Americans and British people speak basic english , why do British people refer to apartments as flats ? ''
** Science is more than a methodology . Empiricism and validation by prediction from anticipated regularit is its methodology . If science were nothing more than a methodology , than no science would exist beyond the confines of any particular experiment and/or collection of observations/measurements undergone currently . However , you are right , in so far as 'science ' _should not_ be conflated with and confused for any particular philosophy , with the possible exception of empiticism . But 'should ' is not the issue . The fact is that , falsely and irrationally , you and other materialist have tried , and with great success unfortunately , to convince the public that your materialism and 'science ' are one and the same . Just denying that you have done so , and that you [ and your fellow darwinists ] continue to do so in your every post , does n't cut the mustard .
its still not a bilateral relation . all living thing manifest energy , but not all things that manifest energy are alive . its easy to turn on your car ignition and make the engine run , heat up , generate electricty and make noise , all from the chemical energy in the gasoline . Still the car isnt alive . on the other hand , in the living body , energy is constantly being converted from chemical to other forms , and the moment energy stops transferring , the body is dead . the relationship between life and energy exists , but it still doesnt conclude that life is energy
Gee , and in what year did he state that ? 2005 ? No way . 2000 ? No . 1995 ? Nope . 1990 ? Nah . 1985 ? Could n't be . Without more information I can give an exact date , but seeing as how Simpson died in 1984 , he must have said that at least 21 years ago ( and if he said it in the middle of his life/career , it would have been more like 60 years ago ! ) - he did not know back then what we now know .
I highly doubt they throw them in the sink . They probably put them in a red plastic biohazard bag , tie it shut , and throw it on the pile of other red bags to be shipped off to a medical waste incinerator to be burned . May sound graphic and callous to you , but it is probably far more accurate that a `` sink full of bloody baby remains '' . Why must the anti-abortion crowd use such fallacious images to sell their point ?
Actually it says *thou shalt not murder* killing a fetus was n't considered murder , that IS stated in the bible.So yeah I agree the command does pretty much mean what it says and does n't reffere to a fetus .
So Joe , do you eat pork ? How about shrimp ?
Fair enough .
Well its not much of a religious debate to me when it comes to free will . I believe the Bible fully supports the idea of free will and even assuming that it says nothing at all , based on the way some things go it is hard to believe a good God would not only allow it to happen , but to make it happen is even worse . I mean , what else is there ? If we do n't have free will and God is the ultimate power , then he must be the one making decisions for us . Ca n't blame the Devil for everything . Nah I guess you could , but that would n't make God sound too good either if he was letting all of his prized creations have their fake lives destroyed by a demon .
And where has Marc9000 been in the past oh 30 years ? Do we need to remind him of the size of the gov't under Reagan ? or how about Bush Sr , or Bush Jr ? Ah yes , so a party that supports the intervention of the federal government in the personal disputes of a family is not favoring bigger domestic government ? That crack rock has to be strong stuff .
No one is saying alcohol is either ... I would say both are not smart to use often ... however , one beer is still better then smoking a bowl .
dreaming up imaginary what if situations doesnt prove anything , youve got nothing
It depends . Do you feel the same way about the Yeti ? How about the Lock Ness monster ? You can make the statement 'Based on the current available evidence , I do not believe in the existance of any god/gods . ' I think it is intellectual fence sitting myself . I feel the same way about God as i do about fairies , the yeti , alien abductions , and 'psychic powers ' . There is no evidence that any of these exist , so based on the evidence , I do n't believe they exist . Should new evidence be forthcoming , I will reevalutate my position based on that evidence .
So abiogeneis is false ? Why does talkorigins say it 's true ? Why does it remain in science textbooks ?
Well , Kellerman for one .
and to think we got back a few gun rights , and we still have the patriot act . i know all the reasons given for why `` THEY '' want to disarm us , what I am trying to understand is why one person wants to see them outlawed .
That is neat , but one catch is that I am an atheist . So who do I get to be the official . A minister would n't really work and it is n't legal so a judge does n't work ... ... so who ?
GREED but what you fail to admit is that that standard of living comes at a price for someone .
Where in Canada is it illegal to defend yourself with a firearm , given sufficient threat ? And what did the Indians do to the Brown 's to justify using deadly force ?
If a scientist does n't believe his test results are accurate , and expects me to place my life savings on his project would that not be pretty stupid .
I apologize for that statement . I just thought that his air of superiority when he was preaching to be simply sickening .
Origins of science , whether truly started by those of faith or not , is irrelevant . Whatever science was , it has become a body of knowledge , through application of reason .
Once again you either pervert our opinion or outright lie as you misrepresent our perspective . I challenge you to quote anyone saying they approve of this action . What we disagree on is who caused the tasering to occur , you believe it was the cops and we argue that it was the woman herself , who refused to obey them . In other words , she is responsible for causing her unborn child to be tasseled , not the cops who were forced to bring her to a point of submission . The problem with you leftists who respond to everything with your knee jerk and emotional reactions is that you exonerate the criminals as you blame the good guys . True reprobates through and through ...
Great . Then define information . If it is unseen , how do you know that it did n't increase . Is n't it necessary that there should be a way to quantify informatiion before you can make claims as to whether it has or has not increased ? Again , evolution does n't account for the origin of life , only the origin of the changes in the heritable characteristics that are observed in populations of living organisms .
No , the legal middle ground between no same-sex marriage and only same-sex marriage is marriage for all , just as the legal middle ground between no opposite-sex marriage and only opposite-sex marriage is marriage for all . Another possiblity would be marriage for none , but let 's not go there .
Flooding is more a immediate problem .
He he , I guess I would definitely consider myself a weed addict . Although , the addiction is more psychological than physical . If you smoke weed all the time and then stop for a week or so , you get really pissy and irritable , but that 's about it . But no regular pot smoker sits around justifying why they do it , they just do it cuz they like it , nothing too complicated about it .
And there you go again.. first of all , misrepresenting all the things everyone has said , and second of all , bringing up that red herring of 'In God We Trust ' . You see , you are mixing up what your basic beliefs are with how you are acting . I do think it is very amusing that the Knights of Columbus , in an effort to 'show how different we are from the Godless Commies '' have tricked the Christians of this country into the worshiping of Idols . They turned the pledge into a prayer , and the flag into an idol , and Money into a God . Do keep on bringing up all these things about 'Noah 's ark ' and such . I guess you hear a sound bit on TV , and believe it hook line and sinker . It demonstrates to me what has to be changed in the schools on that we should teach people how to listen critically , and to actually learn things . I find that knowledge is the enemy of both religion and right wing fundamentalism . When people can actually learn and understand things on their own , and to be able to critically process information , they tend to stop being red neck fundamentalists , and can actually contribute to society .
Hundreds of thousands of atheist scientists do too , since common ancestry with apes harmonizes perfectly with the absence of a creator . They 're seldom asked to answer about that confusion , however .
And Monty , perhaps they are twins ?
All of the evidence from a variety of sources indicates that it is so . Cosmology , astrophysics , nuclear physics , geology and so on all indicate that the earth is old . In fact , the earth looks quite old with some mountains that have been greatly eroded .
I 'm anti-ignorance and superstition . It is not my fault that this is what religion is as well .
Yes , intelligent design is another incarnation of the `` God of the gaps '' idea . What separates it in conceptual terms from YEC ( for example ) is its gaps are much , much smaller , but remain nonetheless . I wonder if we have a true advocate of Behe 's Intelligent Design to argue the corner ?
Only if you make invalid assumptions .
So thats it  theres nothing else to study on the subject ? The process you describe naturally takes long periods of time . Do you wonder if , during this process , information/health/life could lie dormant for long periods of time , or if it would have to make some of its changes close to the time when other things changed , or when the system became operational ? In mid-2001 , the Human Genome Project and Celera Genomics jointly presented the true nature and complexity of the digital code inherent in DNA . We now understand that each human DNA molecule is comprised of chemical bases arranged in approximately 3 billion precise sequences . Even the DNA molecule for the single-celled bacterium , E. coli , contains enough information to fill all the books in any of the world 's largest libraries . ID proponents are often accused of saying goddidit , that settles it , stop looking , and it seems that atheists do that quite often as well . Can you quote any ID proponent saying what you said , that we dont need to develop exact paths  ? Behe can describe exploration of paths , that arent being explored to any great extent now . ( too religious , don't-cha-know ) In his words ; Since the simplest possible design scenario posits a single cell formed billions of years ago  that already contained all information to produce descendant organisms , studies could test this scenario by attempting to calculate how much DNA would be required to code the information ( keeping in mind that much of the information might be implicit ) lf DNA alone is insufficient , studies could be initiated to see if information could be stored in the cell in other ways  for example , as positional information . Other work could focus on whether larger , compound systems ( containing two or more irreducibly complex systems ) could have developed gradually or whether there are compounded irreducibilities. Blind , purposeless , happenstance nature did it , that settles it , stop looking ? Is that your answer ? Is the type of study Behe describes something for atheists to be afraid of ?
No . WND is a menace .
So are you saying I do n't want gun registration ? BTW you do n't fool me . Your intention is not to protect people 's right to life and follow the Constitution .
It looks like the anti gunners are at it again , only now they have a new target . For those who do not follow such things , the FN five seven fires a new round , the 5.7x28 . There are 2 versions of the round availabe , one is an aluminum base , steel core , FMJ round designed to pierce body armor . It is not available to civilians int he US , it is law enforcement only . The other round avaliable IS a civilian round , it is a hollowpoint which has already been cleared by the ATF as a non armor piercing round . The civilian round ( the non AP one ) WILL pierce body armor , as will a .22 magnum , and most solid point .22 LR rounds . Body armor is specifically designed to take the implact from large , slow moving rounds , not small , fast rounds . I am also a little confused as to what makes this an `` assault pistol '' . I have 2 of them . I purchsed them specifically because when the civilian version came out , I fully expected that thet antigunners would pitch a fit and we would see attempts to ban the weapon , which would boost the value of them . They pretty much look like a glock . Why is the five seven an `` assault pistol '' and the glock is not ? While I am sure we are all used to GG 's pushing for bans that have no basis in reality , even I was a little surprised that they moved so quickly on this one . Now , my anti social side is pushing me to pass on a secret regarding AP rounds . If you want a REALLY good AP round , get a 7.62x25 ( tokarev ) . You can pick up a pistol for this caliber VERY cheap ( $ 200 or less for a good makarov ) . Hand load your rounds , but instead of using the 7.62 , order some .30 sabots . You can get them from a bunch of places ( just do a search for `` .30 sabot '' on google ) . They cost about $ 10 for 100 of them . Load your 7.62x25 with a fast burning powder , and you can load a heavier powder load . Use a .223 speer FMJ . Our experiments ( we experimented with this at work when we were working on a contract related to ceramic body armor ) showed that this will go through TWO kevlar vests and 16 inched of ballistics gel , which implies rather heavily that you can reasonably expect to shoot right through 2 police officers using the round , vest or no . This being the case , does n't it seem a little frivolous to be banning a weapon , and the ammo for that weapon , especially since the ATF has already given it the green light as non AP ?
Not everyone agrees with policy . Afterall look at the Brady Campaign , one of their long time members was leaking classified information to the NRA and other pro-gun groups on purpose .
As to your first point , as far as I can tell , you looked at the world and said , `` Naw , there 's no way this happened without God . '' And not just any God , but Trinity father son holy spirit God . The miraculous creation of our existance does not point to Christianity at all . However , you did n't just look at the 'miraculous creation , ' no you had a study guide . Allow me to mention something right here , and point out I 'm a Methodist ... .ahem THE BIBLE WAS WRITTEN BY MEN . Arguing that the events in the bible happened or not is a different issue , but God did not give us a master copy of the bible and tell us to copy it . Biblical scholars have noted that the bible is an amalgam of different authors who had different outlooks on God . The bible is an excellent source of faith and guidance , it is not an infallible work and does not answer all questions . As to your second point , argueing that liberals wish to analyze porn and worship death just shows you have n't really put much thought into this contention . You are right that the government has removed references to Christianity in its subsidiaries like public school . There is a good reason for this . I ca n't for the life of me recall where this quote is from but it said : `` Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . '' This means government is n't suppose to support religious groups . What would you define mandatory school prayer as ? Anyone who has ever argued that a seperation between church and state is n't a good thing has obviously never been the religious minority . I lived in Saudi Arabia for 10 years and I can tell you state supported religion is not good .
Well that explains the twisted thought pattern on our constitution is broken .
Its a lot more interesting for us to read if it is in your own words . If I wanted to read a bible , Id steal one .
No country has removed automoblies after registration . Yet historically after total firearm registration confiscation has followed .
It is curious how lately christians have been telling me that being an aethiest ( which I am ) , is a religion . The above post is a good example of this misunderstanding . First - the lack of a religion is NOT a religion . Second , I 'll simply disagree with your statement . Observation , reasoning , and deduction is exactly what leads me to understand that there is no god , and that religion is merely an attempt to explain what we have not yet been able to reason out . As our knowledge increases , our need for a god decreases , and we can begin to see through the emotional fog of religion that keeps us in ignorance .
Well by that logic , why was n't the Brady campaign , police , or law there to save them ?
Deep ocean is probably the least changed environment on earth . That 's were modern coelacanths live .
I think the real question is not detaching but killing . You do n't detach a fetus during an abortion..you just kill the fetus ( or embryo ) and suck it out . I am not sure Tom is for any of that . But if Tom would die , then no ... Bob has no right to detach ... in fact , probably no right even if he would n't die .
Yes , the mythology has been around for a long time . Most cultures had their own . You have adopted the mythology of ancient Hebrews . You probably even somehow reconcile both stories of creation in your mind . But the technology and the techniques to use that technology did n't develop until about 400 years ago . Every since then we have used the idea that we can learn about our world by careful observation and experimentation . About 150 years ago , Darwin and Wallace recognized a mechanism for why living things change . About the same time , Mendel recognized how those changes were passed on to off spring . That the Biblical mythology of creation was false was actually demonstrated by men who believed in creation . They tried to reconcile their Bible with what was obviously true from the observations they made . But creationism has only been around since the early 20th century . It grew out of the anti-science movement of fundamentalism . It actually became popular in the 1960 's .
No . Wrong . The love that ensures life , liberty , and freedom . Your head is on backwards . I 've never seen a soldier fight for your right to open your mouth by volunteering to lay down his rifle . I 've never met a veteran who ensured your right to peacably assemble by giving up his gun . I 've never heard of a marine who guaranteed your freedom of religion by whining and crying instead of bleeding and fighting . You are an unarmed pacifist . You can never accomplish anything other than sanctimonious preaching and holier than thou mouth wagging . You have never sacrificed personal activity to physically provide or protect a right for anyone . You moan and complain about law abiding folks who actually take the time and responsibility to provide for their own safety instead of passively accepting their own propensity for victimhood such as you do . The one question I have never received an answer to : How is it that you consider it more responsible to require another human being to come running from another location and risk their life in order to save yours after something serious happens , than simply taking the initiative to do it for yourself beforehand ? All it does is blatantly highlight your inadequacy and reliance upon others to perform an action you are too passive to take upon yourself . Out of all murdered victims that have ever existed , I wonder how many have been legally armed ? Yet , if it were up to you , you would ensure we were all in the category containing the majority of victims ... ..because you , yourself , do not have the intestinal fortitude to do something you feel is acceptable for another human being with a shiny metal disk : protect your own life . You can rant . You can rave . You can decry the audacity of those who refuse to meekly submit to the victim mentality you would willingly force upon anyone with the capacity of self reliance greater than your own . There 's one thing you will never do that ensures your eventual and inevitable failure : You will never do anything more than talk . You are incapable of doing anything else . To do anything else would require something entirely too alien to your passive nature : It would require effort and sacrifice to become self reliant . Like soldiers , police , and those who protect their own lives . And that is something you would willingly take away from anyone else . If you were to be successful , you would soon lose the things you state we are cancelling out , but are in fact ensuring for you : life , liberty , and freedom . There 'd be no one left to fight for it .
Exactly . I can hear it now - `` Scientist have created petrified wood in 3 days . This throws serious doubt on the millions of years theory for its development currently accepted by evolutionists , and is strong evidence that the petrified wood touted as evidence for an ancient earth by evolutionists is capable of , and in fact more likely to have been , produced within a short time span of less , certainly less than 6000 years . '' I should be the next `` Dr. '' Hovind . Waxy P.S . I agree on the use of Argon .
Do you believe , like Dawkins in a 'religious gene ' ?
Well done , I have n't read it fully . It does n't interest me . My knowledge of it is near nonexistant . I therefore avoid commenting upon it where possible .
Because if evolution can not explain all changes it is false , Unless you propose some creatures evolved and some were specially created . Is that what you mean ? Genesis says that all creatures were specially created . It fits with the observational evidence but there is no smoking gun that proves it . Statis is the norm not the exception . One is right the other wrong . It can not be both ways . Do you have an answer to how a lizard can morph into a bird considering the amazing difference in the lungs ?
Actually , might I say that you assume that the criminal had a firearm , correct ? This may seem foolish of me , but I 'll go along with you . Now , you can assume that a criminal doens't have the right mindset . There 's always a first crime , but is n't it illegal for an ex-con , a drug addict/alcholic , or someone who has a few screws loose up there to own a firearm ? So we could assume in your situation that the law was n't enforced . So let 's pretend like the law actually is enforced , shall we ? What makes you think the criminal has a firearm ? If he has a firearm , how do you know that it 's because the law was n't enforced ? The solution is to put a bit of muscle into enforcing the laws we have now . You would n't be this guy , would you ? Oh , no , my house is on fire ! I better throw some gasoline onto it ! ... Oh , no , that made it worse ! There 's some trees there that could burn the entire neighborhood down if they catch , so I better throw some more gas onto it ! ... Why is n't it working ? You , over there ! Yeah , you ! Tell everyone that my house is fine !
If you still believe this way , then you must believe then it is OK to kill a child that has been born if it might not be loved , or might suffer , etc . That is the logical conclusion to your argument . If an unborn child and a born child are the same to you , then you can not make a distinction as to which one should be killed and which one should n't . That is the spiralling hole into which abortion leads . There is a basic loss of respect for human life . Your defense actually scares me more than someone who deceives themself into believing the unborn child is not alive .
well said . i agree 100 %
so where is the evolution ?
I think that the bad guys will be happy if any gun control law goes into effect , because then there will be less chance of the victum having a weapon for their defense , and the crime rate will rise ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
So what was the common ancestor of the Old World Monkeys and the Apes , and what did it look like ?
Proof please .
I think there are two separate questions here . ( 1 ) When does personhood begin ? ( 2 ) Who gets to make such arbitrary , moral decisions on behalf of a pregnant woman ? Both are legitimate issues of contention . You ca n't just dismiss the one you do n't want to argue as unimportant . There are lots of excellent arguments going every which way , and many of them are objectively unresolvable , such as the one pertaining to the onset of personhood . They are truly matters of opinion . So , since there is obviously little agreement between people about when an egg and sperm become a person with full human rights , the practical question really is whose opinion matters most ? The woman 's , or the faceless bureaucrat 's ?
Lets have a look at it  a little pause button action , a little jotting down and we have it in writing ! Atheist scientists ( or Algore ) provided me with this technology , not sure which . < -- - ( one of those smileys Mr Poe enlightened me on )
No , I was n't looking for religious morality , I was looking for general morality , so your argument was the kind I wanted to debate . Anyway , what is with people thinking that an activity that creates children is neccesarily a good thing ? There are already a lot of people in the world , and too many more will end up using up all the food , and then there will no people , because we will all die an agonizing death of starvation . Heterosexuality is good , without any reproduction we would die out as well , but homosexuality is also very good and important because without enough non reproductive couples , the population would increase even more .
It is so the womans decision . If the baby is in the womb they have n't experience life , so how can they miss it . And if they are a so called `` soul '' then they will come out somewhere else .
I see now , sorry . Yes you are right : chemical reactions are not random . Simple reactions will be easy to determine precisely . More complex reactions will be more chaotic , but they still will not be random .
So ... you 're saying that you 'd rather have a law-abiding citizen victimized than a criminal threatened ?
Nope . Yowm could be day ( a in opposed to night - thus only around 12 hours or so ) , it could be a 24 hour day , it could be days ( as in a lifetime ) , it could be just a general term for `` time '' or a `` period '' . It could also mean year . Yowm can be translated as each and every one of those . So your statement is false that it is `` understood '' to be that when it could just as easily be translated as one of the others .
Funny , I thought Heribert Nilsson was a botanist . Do n't let little details like that get in your way though .
He was n't trying to . Shooterandproud may be an unreasonable gun nut , but he accepts evolution .
Because he was found guilty of murdering a minor rather than an adult . Any crime committed by an adult against a child is more heinous in nature .
That is generally true . However , have you heard of a disease called AIDS ? Some people are resistant to that disease . Guess what ? They are reproducing more than those who are n't resistant .
Do n't you get tired of passing of just-so statement as argument ?
Well , considering how ambiguous and contradictory the Christian scriptures are , I guess this interpetation makes as much sense as any of the others .
Supply is already controlled . The Gun Control Act of 1968 lists individuals who 're prohibited from firearms ownership or possession , one of the groups that 're prohibited are individuals who 've been found guilty of a felony offense . That means the legal network is about as tightly regulated as it can be while still remaining open to the public .
Kelvin 's already proposed that the armed population of America has given serious protection to the US , specifically he mentioned Japan deciding not to invade . This is of course a nonsense . Iraq is a heavily armed nation -guns were given out to the general population before the USA invaded - ahem- I mean 'liberated ' . Did it stop the US ? Secondly , the specific example given ; that of Japan , is a nonsense . These same people who flung themselves in flying bombs , who refuesed to leave foxholes when starving - and would resort to cannibalism rather than surrender , he believes were worried about a few grannies carrying sawn-off shot-guns .
That 's refreshing . And I am being serious .
Oh wow . Apparently your experience on the internet is quite shallow . To people who have used the internet over a significant period of time , we recognize that the blue text are often links . Moving one 's cursor over the blue text changes one cursor further proving that the text is just not colored . In iangb 's most recent post there are several links . That handle has labeled them 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 . They are different color then the rest of the text and they are underlined . Generally links on forums are denoted that way . Upon clicking one of those links , as clicking is how links are open in internet browsers , either a new window or tab will appear with that page displayed . Two of the links have the full document . If you look at the far right side , you 'll notice a icon that says `` Free full text article . '' That too is a link . In that web page , you 'll see a page divider that is labeled `` Full Text '' and there is a pdf which stands for `` portable document format . '' Within that PDF is the full text . You may need to go to Adobe to download their free reader to read it . The links all initially go to a web page database . Databases often include large amounts of primary source data . A primary source is one of original context , such as a scientific study , a drug test finding , a study of a historical event from a contemporary perspective by someone who lived through it .
No , the origin of the universe has nothing to do with the theory of evolution . The origin of life has nothing to do with the theory of evolution . Scientific disciplines have bounds . Biologists do n't have to account for cosmology because it has nothing to do with the evolution of life on earth . However the universe came into being does n't affect the theory of evolution . However life first arose has no bearing on the theory of evolution . The ultimate origin has nothing to do with the theory of evoution . I do n't see where the definition you quoted does anything to make this point ... ... .
So you solely have a problem with the theory of evolution , but anything in science that does n't involve this theory seems sound to you . Correct ? 2 questions : If you trust the scientific method in the rest of science , and you feel the processes are sound , how do you account for the overwhelming acceptance of evolution ? I mean , are the scientists whose field may involve evolution unique in their lack of integrity and are singularly foolish in endorsing evolution by natural selection ? If the `` evolutionists '' are shills ( for whom I am not clear ) , why is it the other scientists are trustworthy . Do the evolutionary sciences select for a certain type of person . Does your religious belief have any influence on your lack of acceptance of evolution .
How do you know ? Kettlewell was testing the idea the white moths were more visible to birds in polluted areas and visa versa . He showed that that is indeed true .
Because ... .expansion occurs after heat is added . How can a expansion occur with a prior cause ? You 're saying the reaction and cause happen at the same time . Show me an example that does that .
So you made the point on the interpretation of a legal document . The point is it is okay to illegalise abortion regardless of the reasons for doing so . Thinking outside of our current example can you not see the glaring problem with such an approach ? I hope you can because the consequences of accepting such a philosophy are dire indeed . However , returning to our original point , that being the former part of the proposed Bill 's title I 'd like some supporting evidence . I have pointed out the issue 's with Steeeeve 's citation , so hope you have something else to offer .
There are n't any . The chances of the father getting custody of a child are right above zero .

That 's your opinion . Why ca n't they be true Christians ? Does everyone have to fall under the same guidelines ? Do n't you think people are intelligent enough to come to their own conclusions based on fact ?
actually some did talk about the complexity of life as well as irreducible complexity even though it may not be mentioned in the title
Just by being something man made , this can not be a right . Any right that all humans deserve comes directly from God . For example , life , liberty , and property . I understand that many people do not have health insurance . It sucks , and everyone knows it . It is not a right , it is a good . Goods can be purchased in a competitive market priced based on the law of supply and demand , well in our capitalist society . This is an expensive good , and not everyone is fortunate enough to have it . That is just the way it goes , there are ways to fix it , there are ways to make it cost less , but not everyone is going to get it no matter how hard we try . Unless , God makes it a right , it is not one .
But the responsibility does not end with the woman who experiences the pregnancy . If it did , then men would not be required by law to pay child support .

If you can have both however ... -Wez
I think that laws , like history , are written by the victors . Victory has historically justified many crimes comitted by those who win the power to absolve themselve of the inhumanity they exhibited in their struggle for power . The Second Amendment does not negate laws prohibiting homicides . If David Koresh had possessed the courage to survive his encounter at Waco , then he would have been perfectly free to appear before the tribunal of his victorious adversary and defend himself in court on the grounds that his actions were protected by the Second Amendment and/or a right of self defense . I sincerely doubt , however , that you could ever find 12 people who would accept his defense . My vote would certainly go against him . Where I am from , we still refer to the Civil War as the `` War of Northern Aggression . '' But my state entered that contest with the immoral goal of preserving slavery , and I will not attempt to justify her actions through the citizen 's RKBA . She fought a long and glorious struggle which I believe is forever tainted by its immoral purpose . She was vanquished , and no one who answered her call to arms was ever permitted to use the Second Amendment as a shield from the wrath of the victor .
I do n't usually agree with you , but I agree with you on this one . The judiciary branch is there to interpret the law . Do I wish the ruling had been different and the government should have paid for the abortion ? Yes . But the court made the correct decision . It 's the same with the Terri Schiavo case . All the conservatives wanted to save her because they thought the laws were n't right but the judges all sided on the side of the law . The law is written for a reason , and we do n't get to decide when to ignore them just because of compassion . Then we fall down the slippery slope of abridging the first amendment because it 's better , and violating other laws `` for the good of the people '' . It 's like `` Animal Farm '' , where the laws kept changing ever so slightly , and soon it was no better than it was before . The laws were made , and if we want to change them , we should fight them , but court is not the place . Of course we all wish we could just go to the courts and get them to settle disputes like mommy but they are there to interpret the law , and unfortunately the law was very clear here , that in this case the government should not pay for the abortion .

too bad darwinian evolution has nothing to do with it ... ..proven by the fact that not ONE example of a beneficial random mutation can be presented/proven , nor can ONE example of natural selection be proven on the level of the individual . Thus , there 's only one thing left ... .lamarckian inheritance . The body simply has the ability to transmit information about the external environment . It 's that simple . see the butterfly link in the OP .
Actually , there is , my poor addle-minded friend . Indeed , you can argue that she was even exercising her responsibility as a citizen with more civic-mindedness than many because she non-violently and patiently refused to sign the ticket . She has a right not to sign . As H.D . Thoreau said to Emerson in jail , when Emerson said to him , `` Henry why are you here ? '' -- Henry answered , `` Ralph , why are you not ? ''
But you have incorrectly defined evolution , both in a biological and non-biological context . In Darwin 's time the word evolution meant change along a particular path towards a particular end . For example , stellar evolution . That is not what Darwin proposed . That is what creationists like you propose as the meaning of biological evolution .
The Afghanis did VERY well before CIA intervention and arms supplies . They were fighting T-72 tanks with Molotov cocktails , and winning . They were taking out entire armored divisions with dynamite ( by instituting land slides ) . Certainly the CIAs assistance was helpful , but by no means definitive .
You mean , in ways that are different from your pet version ? WW , what defines materialism - the phenomena it recognises - if not their susceptibility to the scientific method ? Science is more than a methodology . Empiricism and validation by prediction from anticipated regularit is its methodology . If science were nothing more than a methodology , than no science would exist beyond the confines of any particular experiment and/or collection of observations/measurements undergone currently .
Let me for a moment frame my blasphemous take on Christianity , the trinity , etc . Folks , you have an Almighty Father God , the first aspect ; then , you have a Holy Spirit -- must be male , was n't that the entity that impregnated the Virgin Mary ? ; thirdly , the Son , male of course . No females allowed . Please note that . Exclusionary of females . Male only club . So ... what do these exclusively male deities do in the heavens all day -- well , sounds like a homosexual club to me so I just speculate on that . All these prohibitions against female power and participation smack to me of a whole bunch of folks who have n't come out of the closet and dealt honestly with their sexuality . Nothing wrong with being homosexual . Dunno about constantly repressing it and denying its existence , though .
I think this is where the pro-life and pro-choice people really get things messed up ... Pro-choices views it as you do Jitobear ... whether a mothers rights supercedes the childs rights as opposed to a pro-lifer who believes that everyone has the same rights and the question becomes what rights are `` on the top '' so to speak . In more detail I guess you could say `` is it a right or a want and what would be a right and do we have finite rights '' . Pesonally , the right to life is kind of the start of every other `` right '' or `` want '' or anything for that matter ... so above all you got that one . I never see it as choosing women over child or whatever because I do n't see a difference in the two ( as people ) .
Wow , I hope I 'm not the only person who went directly to your source to check it out . Lets review several points here : 1 ) The need to display current information . This article is almost four years old , I have yet to hear anything about this over the entire course of Mr. Bush 's presidency . George W. Bush is one of the most personally assaulted Presidents in US history , few will argue this whether they support him or not . Just about every negative thing Bush has been involved in or people speculate he was involved in has been dragged out and there any number of books with the details . This info has had little or no further data in the past 4 years . The press loves a scandal and I have yet to see them shy away from one as juicy as this if it were true . 2 ) The need to display information from a reputable source . Just to clarify Flynt is Larry Flynt since you seemed to leave this detail out . This transcript comes from a bulletin board and the sources it cites are at places like gwbushnotmypresident.com and atheist.org I 'm sure neither of these websites has an agenda . The end of the post displays an anti-Republican manifesto showing that the person who posted it did it with such impartiality . I 'm sure they are focusing on being fair and balanced . 3 ) Make sure the parts of your source that you do n't quote do n't contain info that harms your argument . Larry Flynt bases nearly all of this theory on the alleged event of Bush visiting the girl in the hospital after she had an abortion . If this ever did occur there is no evidence that Bush knew that she had an abortion . Flynt says so himself :
But it 's not a `` fact '' unless you 've defined what you mean by `` person . '' If you define `` person '' as `` the combination of a fertilization event , '' then all you have is a meaningless tautology .

Again , ecological factors play an important role . If the first birds were aggressive carnivores that attacked other aggressive dinosaurs , this may hold water . Yet their skeletal structure suggest that they were small , agile and light dinosaurs equipped for eating insects and such . The Theropods actually had to gain muscle to provide powered flight which was a later development . ~Monkey

All of the British papers keep going on about how bad it is , how more people than ever are being gunned down in the streets , how guns are being imported into Britain and resold through underground channels , how criminals employ young women to act as gun mules for transporting and storage , etc .

so why do they call polar bears and brown bears different `` species '' when they can breed and produce fertile offspring together ? Same with different varieties of finches . It seems to me that evos do n't at all go on the ability to breed or produce viable offspring , but instead just on mere looks ... .otherwise , why would they have made such obvious mistakes with the bears and finches , not to mention countless others ? I wonder if Big Science would consider black people different `` species '' than say Asian people or white people -- they look different , which is their main criteria ... .so why not ? As a creationist , I can very comfortably say that all humans are of the same kind .
Too much spin there buddy . The potentiality arguement is used by those who believe women have a right to have control over their fertility . As an aside it is also a fundemental tenent in Judaism 's view of the unborn- the foetus is a potential life , but has not yet attained that state of being , which occurs at birth .
Well good on you for taking a proactive stance against the AiG misinformation campaign To add to what johnhanks said be careful about about insulting them- regardless of how infuriating their position is the weight of evidence and reason is firmly on the side of science . Use this to your advantage as it means you can rise above the personal attacks/character assassination that the likes of AiG so frequently resort to . Secondly be careful in the use of the term creationist- remember AiG are Young Earth Creationists and do not speak for creationists as a whole- there are Christians who accept the analysis of science yet still see the universe as the creation of God ( ie . Old Earth Creationists ) . This is significant as it is important to drive the point home that YEC does not speak on behalf of all Christians ( as it likes to make out ) , but are a group on the fringe whose position is seen as ridiculous by Christian and non-Christian alike . Put this to them and you force them to start attacking fellow Christians . P.S . Welcome to the Forum !
Actually , I can not accept that claim . Before then , the absolutely youngest ever surviving fetus was deliver at 19 weeks , 6 days . 12 weeks would be a worldwide sensation . I would recommend that you double-check your source . Viability is still defined as the age at which 50 % survive , which still is at around 24 weeks gestation/26 weeks pregnancy .
Excellent point ... ... ... ... ... .Anyone that is personally against abortions should fight to stop all the unnecessary ones that our performed ... ... ... .
NO , these were all ammedments . all passed . All written recently . There are laws on the book from the 1800 's but that is n't what just passed .
Exactly . Trying to prove that God , if he exists , did n't make us as good as an all powerful being should have made us does n't prove anything in the God debate . I could always debate that since God is all powerful and all knowing he could have always thought of something better to do . If he made those changes , then of course there would still be something better he could have thought of . This would be an endless loop of creating something better and better until finally he would have to stop and say that is good enough . But even then this debate that he did n't make us as good as he could have would be valid in my view .
That is a nice little pistol with lots of smack for only 11 onces . Also , I like DA automatics .

Baby can be used to describe a human fetus . Get over it .
You seem to feel that scientists care about `` creation '' more than they do . Neither Kettlewell nor Majerus mentions creation or even takes it into account . But you have believed creationists who probably do n't know as much as you . Kettlewell 's work was not a fraud . He did the best he could with what he had and presented his work in peer reviewed literature . His work has nothing to do with creation . But it seems that creationists want to believe that all science is permanent and never changing . Thus , when re-evaluation of Kettlewell 's work is done and flaws are pointed out , creationists loudly proclaim fraud and a victory for creation . Funny that it was n't `` creation scientists '' who pointed out the flaws and it was n't `` creation scientists '' who publicized them . It was done by two evolutionary biologists who did n't even mention creation .
It is ? If a child grew up never hearing the words religion , gods , spirits , etc . would this child still have faith of some sort ? Is faith some innate human tendency ? It could be seeing as how there is the `` god spot '' in the brain , but maybe the god spot would n't develop as fully in the child that was never exposed to religion or thoughts of the supernatural . Then again , kids are scared of the dark ...
Well survival of the fittest was not Darwins term- although he may of used it it the later editions of the Origin . The phase was actually coined by Herbert Spencer in 1851 . Weiner could be forgiven for his statement- if he had read the first edition of the Origin ( regarded as being the best version as it contains no responses to critiscsms that were levelled at the preceeding editions ) he would not have come across it under Darwins name . It is moot really , as natural selection is the term that is used in this context today .
I think some people will and have argued that . I 'll work on finding a quote , but I believe it was somebody here who argued that , because of the recent SCotUS ruling , home invasion in DC would decrease because criminals would be more worried about encountering a homeowner with a gun . You do have a point about preventing a worse crime from occuring , though .
But religion is not a topic for science classes . Teach the science in class and if that presents a problem for your religion at home , perhaps you should think about your religion a bit more critically and realistically . What is being attempted is to cast doubt on well established scientific theory and pretend that magic is a viable alternative .

http : //www.answersingenesis.org/home ... sd/grocott.asp So who decides what is or is n't science ? If what was taught in science classes was no more controversial than the freezing point of water or the melting point of lead , then maybe it could be defined in a way that everyone could agree on . But when it gets into theories and hypothesis about one time events that happened thousands , or billions of years ago , its time to set aside what we think science is , and ask ourselves what science class is trying to accomplish . If we take students to a theoretic area where we suspect there is more to be discovered , is n't it time to consider teaching them HOW to think , not WHAT to think ? Can we do that by ruling an entire concept out , in a society that exercises free inquiry and advocates progress ? Every subject taught in school is different , but science is , ( and has to be ) about so much more than teaching prior knowledge . 2 ) Let 's look at the dictionary.com definition of religion ;
But if you had read carefully the information that I provided you would realize : The people that already own weapons do n't seem to be doing much to combat crime and are probably doing more to cause the problem than to solve it . So throwing more guns at the problem does n't seem to make much sense .
Hey Sarge , add Democratic on their , and it could be called the DPRK ; its kinda going that way anyhow.People start calling it that now , they will fall in line faster .

Possibly , I must admit I never tried to gain access to swords whilst over there .
I 've examined Hall 's papers and they make interesting reading . However , further research , including some undertaken by Hall himself , has informed the debate greatly . For one thing , many of the experimental results to which Hall originally proposed sub-population hypermutation ( your 'hypermutation as a eusocial response ' ) as an explanation have proved inconsistent with that hypothesis . The Amplification Mutation model described above is a much better fit , correctly predicting such details as clonally-related bacteria possessing redundant lac- copies in addition to the lac+ revertant . The articles I 've already cited , though they focus on the Cairns system 's experimental vulnerabilities as the origin of the recent directed/adaptive mutagenesis misperception , also include Hall 's work in their assessment . Hall himself performed a followup experiment to his work on anomalous rates of trpAB+ dual revertants , acknowledging that a colleague 's suggestion , that stochastically-occurring trpA+trpB revertants were growing on waste byproducts secreted by non-growing trpAtrpB+ revertants was probably correct . In short , though hypermutation of a sub-population does occur sometimes , it is not always an organismic response ( eg mutation promoters coincidentally amplified along with useful genes ) , and the 'successful ' mutants do not always , or even mostly , arise from within that subpopulation . Also , you still seem reluctant to acknowledge the implications of the existence of a physical mechanism for hypermutation under stress . It must itself have evolved somehow - which makes it logically ( as well as empirically , as evidenced by my original post in which 4/5ths of the adaptive bacteria exhibited no increased mutation rate ) not a prerequisite for evolution . It 's just one more adaptation to the environment - in this case , the environment 's potential for inducing - though carcinogens or simple uncertainty at the molecular level - genetic change .
And what is wrong with giving homosexuals the right to settle down with the person they love ? What is it to you if a few limp-wrists get married in San Francisco ? Homosexuals are people , too , who take out their garbage , pay their taxes , go to work , take care of their dogs , and what they do in their bedroom is none of your business .
Of course they 're not very smart ; they put more stock in fable than in undeniable evidence . However , since when is intelligence a necessary component of effect ? ( Dubya has affected the entire world ; does that mean he 's a genius ? ) To be fair , that feedback could be interpreted in different ways : the `` flaws in arguments '' might be from the DVDs , or they might be the alleged flaws that the DVDs `` expose .

It 's not a literal account unless you interpret it that way .
You mean that the planets and stars have always existed ? Really - so how come we see stars being made in nurseries via the Hubble telescope .
i think i like this answer because they said it offered an explanation . and you also have a choice to belive that explanation . becuase several.. not too smart people ... developed other ideas of how this magnificent earth got here . oh and johnhanks i will never believe evolution . and that my opinion . and im not saying has to believe it i just wanted to know your take on this question .
May I attempt to respond as an IDist would respond ? 1 ) If God -- err , the designer can pop IC systems into existence at will , do n't you think He ... /she/it can do so any way he/she/it damn well pleases ? See also answer 2 . 2 ) IDists need no mechanistic explanation . The idea that evidence for design means design stands by itself . ( Nevermind that the crux of ID is that it demands an evolutionary mechanism for the appearance of alleged IC/ '' unevolvable '' systems ; the ID philosophy totally sidesteps that requirement . ) 3 ) Again , the validity of ID depends not on the designer 's choices but only on the designer interacting at all . 4 ) OEC/IDists will claim that environmental conditions have changed over millions of years just like mainstream science says they have ; after all , some IDists `` do n't doubt '' mechanisms such as natural selection . For the obvious problem of the designer `` letting '' species go extinct , see answer 3 . I 'm guessing that YEC/IDists will just point to the flood . And the conspiracy theorist/IDists will blame Satan for trying to mislead people . 5 ) Not a single one . ( Either that answer , or maybe `` Well , uh , has n't Behe done something by now ? `` , which still means none . ) So there you have it . An evolutionist 's formulation of an IDists response . Appropriately , because ID as a whole is essentially an argument from ignorance , ignorance plays a role the answers to all your questions . ( `` Do n't know '' / '' Do n't care '' / '' Does n't matter . '' ) ID simply sidesteps these issues . Also notice that none of the statements are testable or falsifiable , except for the parts of the OEC view that are perfectly compatible with geology and evolution . Some will claim that they `` have no reason '' to doubt common descent ( a la Behe ) but do a conspicuously good job of not saying they actually believe it . And if any IDists have a problem with my responses , they 're able to post their own responses . However , they were able to do that even before I responded , and they did n't ...
Illinois government probably agrees . They should be shot immediately . Because once they 're armed , it wo n't be so easy .
Doctors ARE schooled in nutrition , however inadequately , this does n't mean they 're going to recommend crackpot `` raw food '' dietary schemes to prevent destructive `` lamarckian evolution '' on the basis of a single flawed experiment on cats .
Translation : Anti-abortionist intellectuals are n't really opposed to abortion as an end in itself , they only oppose abortion because they believe forcing women to remain pregnant is an appropriate punishment for their True Sin , sex outside of marriage . The goal is n't to `` prevent murder '' at all , this is merely a convenient excuse to punish women who stray from traditional relationships . That 's why those opposed to abortion are also opposed to contraception , even though contraception prevents abortion . So the fact that abortion protestors also prevent people from accessing contraception is n't contradictory at all , it is completely in line with their goals .
No . I have never stated that Biblical creation is a lie . I have stated that a literal interpretation of it has been proven false beyond all reasonable doubt .
And this stems back to drug prohibition . Since drug dealers ca n't go to the police or any other security agency for protection from their customers or competitors , they are forced to rely on their reputation for violence . Remove drug prohibition and you 'd solve most of America 's problem with murder . Within a year , there 'd be no street drug trade . Sure , there 'd still be drug addiction , but it would be a health and safety problem , like nicotine or alcohol addiction , not a murder problem . Adding gun prohibition on top of drug prohibition is only likely to compound it .
i wouls suggest that `` brand '' of christianity that doesnt take genesis as literal is based on an unbiblical doctrine . as you demonstrated above , in order to remove the significance of genesis , you must fill in the gaps with explanations that are not based on , and sometimes contrary to , the bible . clearly , why even call that a christian if they are not folowing the pattern of christ , dont believe in redemption and original sin , and dont believe that this very redemption restores man back to the form man was originally intended to live . that said , i 'm very curious to hear exactly how this `` brand '' of christian fits evolution into the scripture as a basis for their christianity . in order to do that , they 'd need to : - understand exactly what the `` allegory '' of genesis represents - explain how man can be considered in the likeness of God presently - explain exactly why jesus died if there is no original sin - identify the time in history that God was first revealed to man - account for the souls of the homonid species before modern man so far , noone has even ever come close to scratching the surface on these questions . in fact , members of this `` brand '' of christianity become VERY hard to find when discussions like these arise . yet they are quick to pat themselves on the back for `` not being like those fundamentalists who reject science '' . if your version of christianity is the right one , lets discuss it
Really ? I suspect that you have been duped by creationist ministers . There is no hype about Miller/Urey . It was an interesting experiment that demonstrated possibilities .
No need to learn more . It is n't an exception . The exception is the vagina ( and the uterus ) . Males do n't have corresponding structures , inside out or otherwise . The penis is n't an inverted vagina , it is a testosterone influenced clitoris .
Yea the legalizatioin of drugs would cause an epedimic of problems . Crime , suicide , mental health problems , and physical health problems .
Any geologists want to help me out here ? What they mean by this is that there are sediments in one place and sediments in another place . They can date them radiometrically to determine that they are both from the Edicarian period ( even though they may be seperated by millions of years ) . They then verify that they are Edicarian by looking at the layering to determine if the two pieces were at one point connected , but are now seperated due to tectonics . I 'm sure I 'm not entirely correct about these methods . I think I 'd better study up on some of these qeustions HERE . Maybe you should too .
did you miss this quote in the article ? ? ? ? Clanking like ceramic , all of these bones were fossilized All I have to say is you guys are hilarious .

Fossils Yield 10-Million-Year-Old Bone Marrow -- A First http : //news.nationalgeographic.com/n ... ssil-bone.html Fossilized bone marrow has been discovered in ten-million-year-old frogs and salamanders from an ancient lake bed in Spain , scientists announced Friday . The specimens are the first examples of fossilized bone marrow ever to be discovered . They are so well preserved that the original color of the tissue is still visible . `` The marrow is organically preserved , '' McNamara said . `` The original color of the marrow is preserved . Like modern frogs , she says , the bones show an inner zone of yellow , fatty marrow , encircled by an outer zone of red marrow .

You mean he does not agree with your view of christianity .
Good . Better yet if they had access to and used birth control to begin with .
This was done in my post # 7 of this thread . I showed that the research articles NARTH claims to quote say something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT than what NARTH pretends ...
You listed the wrong website it is from the YCLUSA , they never talked about Stalin , and China and Vietnam have less laws limiting Capitalism than the US does so thay do n't count . Oh yes and I as a communist have read more than this like Communist Manifesto , Das Kapital , and The State and Revolution . and I have read much history of the USSR and I frequently visit a communist forum . And I have read the Soviet documents from the 30 's , most `` Modern Information '' comes from Nazi William Hearst , Robert Conquest , and The Fascist Alexander Solzhenitsyn .
So you believe that the person who is going to die has no say so in the matter of what happens to their body ? What if they said that because of organ donor shortages that now it would be law in your state that when you die , all of your organs would be taken out of your body and reused without your permission . Would that be OK for them to do ?
That is the only purpose it was created for . One must wonder if BS can have several uses to man and ID has but one which is the more valuable ?
Fair enough . However , before we start I would like to clarify a few minor points in your opening challenge .
If DOMA is n't declared unconstitutional , then those arguing against Prop 8 are micturating into the wind .
You can do whatever you want to do with your money . The fact that you do n't know any better than to do that with your money is telling , though . If you think that the C ( R ) SC actually does ID-based scientific research , you 're exactly the dupe they 're looking for . I 'm serious . Do the research for yourself . I wo n't even give you links , because you 'll blow them off as propaganda . Find any scientific journal article written by a DI member that 's actually based on actual scientific experimentation or investigation and supports ID . I dare you .
So you only class an abortion as something that occurs 8 weeks after conception ? That 's your line to draw . However , I doubt you could persuade many courts that 'looking like a human ' was a valid qualifier for being a person . Everyone draws the line somewhere - be it conception , birth , or some point in between the two ( if not before or after , in some cases ) . That does n't mean that their version of 'the line ' should automatically be the legal one . At the moment ( in the UK , at least ) , that line is legally drawn at the point when the baby becomes viable ; that is , when it could potentially survive a premature birth . Before that point , everyone can choose their own qualifiers . You can argue that the line should be legally redrawn ... but I doubt 'looking like a human ' will be considered the strongest of arguments .
Yes .
How something `` looks basically '' is basically irrelevant . How well a bird flies is very important . If a bird is born with feathers in the wrong position , it will probably not fly well and will have a much harder time evading predators .
Like campaigning for better information on and access to b/c you mean ? That 's what pro-choice groups do . Like seeking to improve benefits and general support for single parents ? yup , they do that too . As an individual , i give up time and resources to help the local family planning clinic . I ran sexual health campaigns at college . I recently did a drive to get goods to sell at a jumble sale , the profits of which go to a local single parent ( note - not just single mother ) group - and that 's just for starters . What do you do to help lower the abortion rate ?
Right . Spoken like a true YEC . In other words , you want the state to teach your religion in science class . Why the dishonest posing ? Why do n't you explain to us how your religious mythology is science ? If you get to teach your religion , can I teach mine ?
And Godwin in one ! VT loses . Sorry , but those are the rules ...
and
A fact is simply a phenomenon that is observable by any competent observer . It is not proven . For example , Euclid made the assumption that one and only one straight line exists between two points . This is generally considered a fact . However , two points that can not be connected by a straight line could be discovered tomorrow , and that Euclid 's first postulate would be disproven .
Ca n't be dissapointed if I know not to expect more ...
And what `` basic science '' would that be ? Did you look up `` self organizing systems '' yet ?
Well , I guess you got something there . . . . . .ca n't put the cart before the hose ! !
all people are biased , so all science is wrong
It may not be scientific to begin at step two or step three .
So you are pro-life and you hate liberals ? Actually Republicans are being liberal in this case ( liberal=bigger government , more laws ) . But I 'll assume you mean Democrats on this . What if the baby is a democrat ? If it 's a democratic parent it 's most likely it will grow up democratic and one more person to attempt to keep abortion legal .
Not really . It is just another matter that you spoke with authority about without actually learning the facts .
You actually think Evolution works by what creatuers want ? You think they just got up one day and said , `` ya know Bob , I wan na evolve . '' ! ! Oops , there goes my tail ! ! One want an organism can change is due to being in a different environment , isolated from the previous group . Mutations can occur , and if they are n't killer , they are passed on . Changes in genetic material through mutation add to the gene pool and are passed on through mating . If you are an isolated group of animals , and you have enough mutations and mating , you will change over time . The environment , through one process , can choose who succeeds and who does n't . It 's natural selection . There are other mechanisms , of course , so that 's not the only one . We already know that Human brain development could possible have occured due to a new diet , in a new area . Meat allowed for a larget brain , which in turn allowed for better skills , compared to other animals . Humans used tools as well , which was aided by using hands . Eventually , these animals descended from the trees and ceased to be arboreal creatures , because they needed to use their hands for tools . You ca n't do that that well if you are swining in a tree .
** Which is why you darwinists , for all that you parade yourselves as 'scientists ' , are really nothing but 'true believers ' , intent upon evangelizing your core ideology , materialist atheism .

And can you provide a citation from the Constitution that supports the notion that a President can send the military half-way round the world without a declaration of war from Congress ? Come now . To call an issue `` settled law '' is , as someone else pointed out , to emphasize stare decisis , i.e . `` to stand by what has been decided , '' i.e . to recognize the binding nature of precedent . This is why , in those rare cases where long-standing precedents are overturned , it 's such a big deal : the court essentially admits that it had been wrong . As to so-called `` judicial activism '' -- and again as someone else pointed out -- to emphasize stare decisis is preciesly the opposite of `` judicial activism . '' With regard to Roe itself , what I find remarkable is that the court exercised so much restraint : the justices explicitly refused to make a declaration about when life begins . They explicitly claimed not to have any qualifications to make such a decision , and they noted that even those who examine the issue thoroughly -- scientists and physicians , theologians and philosophers -- are nowhere near a consensus on the matter . So they decided not step in and settle such metaphysical questions . Indeed , it is ultimately individuals whom the court allowed to make this decision as they see fit . And so , they based the decision on the right to privacy . Said right is not explicit in the Constitution , but that does n't matter ( see the Ninth Amendment for why ) . And said right is also not absolute ( as the decision again explicitly says ) : it is limited in this case by the state 's compelling interest in protecting prenatal life ( a point which is often overlooked by all sides in the abortion debate ) , and that interest is directly proportional to the viability of the fetus . But what Roe clarified is that any law establishing the protection of prenatal life as an unconditional trump of the mother 's right to privacy is unconstitutional . Within reasonable limits , she herself gets to decide when life begins , and to act accordingly . Like I said , judicial restraint . And a stunning example of defending the individual from government interference or social discrimination in matters of conscience , to boot .
And no , Simone , a market is a metaphor for countless individual relationships . To say it should be regulated is to say the government should interfere with consensual relationships.. To say that consensual relationships are immoral and that interfering with them is moral is turning morality on it 's head ; .
While this is true , the number of abortions at or after 21 weeks is not insignificant . According to the Guttemacher Institute , 1.2 % of abortions occur at or after 21 weeks . That translates into about 15,480 abortions . This thread , of course , is talking specifically about those 15,480 abortions .
But that is your goal whether you want to admit it or not . And that is your sole way of defending creationism as you have admitted you can not argue creationism based on its own merits . Creationism is wrong independent of Evolution . Even if you somehow manage to disprove evolution ( along with every science ) you still have to even take a single step towards proving Creationism .
Well either way he did n't answer the question . I saw the video . I saw and heard his responce . He ca n't squirm his way out of the fact that he did n't know the answer . The internet site also quotes :
The difference is subtle , but I do n't `` believe in '' science , I believe it . It is the best explanation for observed reality . Of course , there is no problem with challenging science . But `` believing in '' mythology is n't a challenge . That 's why you have been asked for evidence . That 's why you have been asked to support your assertions . I suspect that what we will get from you as `` proof '' will be scientific sounding statements based on no evidence , that have no predictive value , and have n't been tested - that is , challenged . I suspect that we will find that you will `` challenge '' us `` evos '' with information that you have n't challenged . It will be a statement by some religious guru making religious claims . You will `` believe in '' it - you will accept it without challenge .

First : `` ... maybe not random at all . '' Next : `` so since variation is not random ... '' One error found . Conclusion : `` all members of a population will change at the same time . '' Two errors found . Environmental cues will not cause a specific change . Selective pressures , on the other hand , will support a specific change ( or multiple changes ) .
It is not speculation . When the 2nd Amendment was written , modern military weapons were flint lock rifles . The whole purpose of the 2nd Amendment was so common people could fight off a state armed with modern military weapons . Today the weapons have changed , but the need or the intent has not . The 2nd Amendment does not mean we fight a tyrannical government with flint lock rifles .
EXTREME minority . Pandions ascertations are rediculous . In the end , the decision will be made based on the accuracy of the proposal , nothing else . Back in 1999 when they removed macro evolution from the curriculum requirements , they did so because their science advisory board , a board composed of college professors from our state colleges , including a couple of folks who are cinsidered some fo the top biologists in the world , told them unanimously that while macro evolution was the best theory we currently have , it may be wrong . Apparently while there is a huge amount of data and emprical evidence to support micro evolution , the same body of evidence does not necessarily prove macro evolution . Panion is simply a zealot on the other side of the issue from the YEC folks . He/She sees gloom and doom for anybody that dares approach the theory . This kind of thinking is what sets us back to the middle ages . If we do not present the holes and weak spots in the theory , how are they ever going to be filled ?
You are exactly right and I believe that is Gods intent . When it comes right down to it , each person must make his peace with God . It is our responsibility and our right as individuals . We have the freedom to choose . It is our God-given right to decide what we will do with God and Christ .
So now the definition of evolution is 'pre-existing genes switching on and off as needed for various environments ? ' It is these kinds of articles that are so transparently silly that really irritate me . An evolutionary mutation of a gene is : a new and useful gene that never b4 existed , bring new body structures and functions that never b4 existed . Switching genes on and off is why built in redundancy has generated such a wide variety of creatures in such a wide variety of environments . There has NEVER been 1 example of a newly created gene that provided a new beneficial function based entirely on new information forming on the gene . The mutations are ALWAYS a net loss of information and as the genetic load continues - eventually all life will morphidite and die out . The propaganda of the antibiotic resistant `` Superbugs '' was the biggest bunch of lieing nonsense of its time . There are still people who believe that too . They do n't think - they believe .
Well , if they 've re-established control in New Orleans ( and it seems they have ) , then taking a gun away from someone carrying it on the street would be what the police normally do in any city . If they were taking it away from peoples ' homes , and not letting them keep them , that would be over and above what they normally do . ( I 'm very pro-2nd Amendment , so do n't get me wrong here . I 'm just pointing out that taking guns away from people happens in every city every day ) I also think that it 's kind of disingenuous to complain about the military coming in -- just a week ago everyone was criticizing the govt . for NOT sending in the military . Now people are criticizing them for doing it ? ? ?
Well said , SP .
Typical little child , all he can offer is condescending insults while never daring to refute the arguments made . But you 're in good company as that is all your cohorts can do also . You must reject and denigrate that which is just as reasonable an explanation of the available evidence as your side offers . That 's why it 's a waste of time going around in circles with you guys . But I 've made my point . Again , What is shown very clearly from all of these scientific interpretation of the same evidence is that there are two ways to interpret it . But for you evos to claim victory based on your interpretation which is as biased as ours is , is the epitome of arrogance . We may have to agree to disagree peeling , but do n't you dare just assume you 're right and the debate is over because you have proven nothing absolutely .
Still it is a good example for a flaw in our body that God would n't have put there for any good reason other than to cause pain and death in the unfortunate few .
Your concept of there being no God is an irrational claim , that leads , inevitably , to a string of reason based firmly on an irrational or illogical premise . I copied your words as it may be easiest to for you to understand the point I am trying to make . The use of God is a rational assumption . Your use of there not being a God is an assumption . By definition of reason , it is the intellectual faculaty by which conclusions are drawn from premises . On the existence of a rational Creator who made us in His image , our `` intellectual faculty '' would also be made in His image . Thus it is rational and logical . Hence , the conclusion that we come to from the premise that God exists is rational and logical . While evolution says we are accidents , and hence , our brain patterns that governs our logic and ability to reason must also be accidnets ( i.e we would be irrational and illogical ) . After reasoning , the conclusions we came to would be most likely irrational and illogical . As you can see from the definition of reason , it depends on your starting faith or belief systems as to what conclusion you will come to . Another word for this faith is assumptions .

Where has this been shown ? Darwin did marry his first cousin and his offspring did n't seem the worse for wear . Two of his sons were knighted ( Sir George Darwin , F.R.S. , and Sir Francis Darwin , F.R.S . ) and they lived to be 67 and 77 , quite respectable ages for their time . Sir George was a mathematician and astronomer and Sir Francis was botanist . Notice that both were fellows of the Royal Society , a distinction achieved by only the most respected of scientists . Additionally , supersnort does n't seem to be aware that all of our domestic animals were produced by inbreeding . That 's why they are called `` pure breed '' or `` thoroughbred '' . And then there is the case of the Hawaiian royal family . When Europeans first got to Hawaii they found that the royal family was easily recognized because they were taller and more robust than other Hawaiians . The reason was that royals always married royals and that children with any imperfections were killed at birth . Does n't speak too well for your `` hypothesis . ''
Again , it 's not the point . There are many who do n't deny evolution , they believe it was guided . Showing examples of guidence - through artificial selection supports this theory

But , of course , this is true of any test question in any science class . No test question in science ever asks for an opinion . They all ask for answers that confirm a knowledge of the science . The law is meant to intimidate teachers . But if a student expresses a religious opinion on a biology test , that opinion is actually irrelevant . The only consideration in grading the test is whether or not the correct answer was provided . The student may also give an answer based on religious mythology , but as long as the correct answer is given , the student passes . However , if a student answers all questions in a class of earth science or life science with religious mythology , that student fails . He/she is n't being penalized because he/she expressed his/her religious mythology , he/she is being penalized because he/she did n't answer the question correctly . Students are not asked to express opinions , religious or otherwise , on tests of knowledge of science . They are required to confirm that they have a grasp of the science .
Is supposed to be logical but is a fallacy oft repeated to lure unsuspecting readers to your conclusion without any factual evidence . It is similar to the claim `` stricter gun laws prevent suicides '' . We know this is false from Japan 's history and statistics . We also know from criminologist and sociologists that method substitution does nothing to prevent suicides . In fact , in kanada , suicides increased with stricter gun laws ... another failed experiment . YOUR hint of `` developed nations '' is misleading and by presentation you try to lure the reader into thinking that gun control only exists in `` developed nations '' as if there is a superiority in people who inhabit them . Tell you what star gazer , list the `` undeveloped nations '' . I would say your nation is barbaric and undeveloped At the very least , you demonstrate it is uneducated
and what would that be ? Would it be a violation of the laws of physics , whatever that is , if I could think or believe myself into healing a disease or various medical condition ?
And as such , the term as you use it is utterly meaningless as it could be applied to any cell or sell remnant of human origin .

No , it was n't . Given the number of scientists one might assume that at least one would confuse his science with his religion . It seems that according to AIG , 182 actually do . I really have to commend AIG in that they did not list `` Dr. '' Kent Hovind , `` Dr. '' Carl Baugh , `` Dr. '' Don Patton . However , the AIG does list Thomas Barnes who 's highest earned degree is an MS in physics , his Sc.D being honorary from his undergraduate , Christian university . Clifford Burdick has a `` degree '' from a non-university ( as described in the mimeographed bulletin of the `` University of Physical Sciences '' , from which Burdick claimed his degree : `` 'The University is not an educational institution , but a society of individuals of common interest for the advancement of physical science . There are no campus , professors or tuition fee . `` ) . Harold Slusher has an honorary degree from a Bible college with only a 1/2 man graduate science department in addition to his `` degree '' from Columbia Pacific University a non-accredited correspondence school that promises a degree in less than a year . I do note that Clifford Burdick is listed on list of deceased scientists who believed in a creator . I presume that the rest of the `` scientists '' listed by AIG actually have the PhDs that AIG claims of all 182 listed . I invite you to compare that list to the Steve list , now at 720+ scientists named Steve who accept evolution as the correct explanation for the observed diversity of life . The name `` Steve '' ( and variations thereof ) comprises about 1 % of the population . The percentage of qualified scientists with that name can not be far from the norm . The Steve list was initially composed of scientists with PhD degrees biology , geology , paleontology , or a related scientific field . However , there are also scientists in fields such as cosmology and astrophysics that are signatories as well as other fields with an interest in evolutionary theory . For example , Stephen Hawking has signed the Steve list . I invite you to find bogus and inappropriate degrees on the Steve list . I am sure that the NCSE would be appreciative of your efforts . Hopefully you will have a more difficult time than I did in identifying bogus degrees . Oh , yes . In my experience , creationist scientists were always creationist long before they were scientists . On the other hand , there are lots of scientists who were once creationists , before they became scientists . As many polls have shown , the more educated a person becomes , the less likely it is that he/she is a creationist .
So you actually have no answer but insult ? It would be nice if you could respond with some intelligence just once .
Because if you let gays marry because it is an alternitve way the equal protection says that if you let one happen you have to let the others have that right to . But that is not really my point my real point is that if we let this happend it will ruin marriage in this country , marriage is a bond between a man and a women and if we let gays marry this country will be ruining that tradition thus making this country more secular then it all ready is . AND WE HAVE TO STOP THAT .

Worse , as Plato said , it is like a disease in the brain . When Christianity , or the Politicalzation of Religion has gone wrong , there is a standard , a moral standard , that declares this wrong . Consider , Nuremburg Trails , when the Nazis said , they were just answering to a higher authority and follow Party power , the judge declared , that they broke their own Laws , and they would answer to a HIGHER POWER - GOD . Case closed , we over road their relativism , or Nazis morality and condemned many to death . So , in every case , when Christians , or those foolishly acting in the name of Christianity have gone wrong , they are condemned by an objective moral standard . Athiesim has no such standard , and I do n't want to hear about relative `` ethics '' that mean nothing , or have no longevity , or change with the winds .
Oh really ? Then what is it ?

Well I ca n't really refute that , now can I ? Congrats for your one paragraph and your God given common sense debunking the last 50 years of molecular biology . Please refer to any highschool biology text to confirm the study that has been proven time and again that DNA allows for the creation of protiens that make up our body . It is the kind and number of these protiens and enzymes that determine what we look like , what instincts we have , etc .
No , I mean evolution , in which statistically random variation is but one factor . It 's a terrible mistake to equate evolution with pure chance .
Only those ignorant of science and evolution think that `` evolution '' has anything to do with the Bible . I guess that 's because creationism is an attempt to pretend that mythology is somehow scientific and makes silly statements about science . It seems that science is somehow anti-Bible in that case when science debunks ignorance .
Yes , it does have value only if the woman wants it , in the early stages , when it does n't have sentience , only potential and DNA . Because then it has value only because of a woman 's wants and choices and her dreams for the future . Nothing else gives it value .
Now you 've ruined it ! You 're not supposed to mention god . That 's the whole idea . ID is stealth creationism . XXXXXX pretend that there is some scientific basis for the assertion that there is some sort of magical designer that is responsible for everything , but they do n't say it 's god . If they did that , then ID would be religion and introducing it into schools would be unconstitutional .
But I think he likes you . My bad on the name though - my only excuse is that by thinking of him as Sspurt , it keeps me from calling him something worse in type . However , note that I did n't say he was philosophically identical to you - I just said that the two of you are left with denying and obfuscating , a charge that I stand by .
And how did the Wise Creator come into existence ? All that wisdom and creativity can not come to existence accidentally or spontaneously ...
It is more along the lines of tree dwelling to prairie . Take a look at how the current tree dwelling primate loco move , then look the mammals that live on the plains tend to stand up to peer over the grass to see if enemies are coming .
Well , I`ve always seen denmark to have a rather high level of political , economic , social and religous freedom ( the only real detriment is high taxes , but some would argue that high taxes coupled with a large amount of income distribution actualy increases economic freedom , so its kind of ambigous ) . This being mixed with relative socialistic and prosperous economy makes Denmark a good contestant for the title `` the land of the free '' .
All you have said is there are two apples . I noticed you said describe , I can describe what a chair is , but that description is not the chair itself . Are the apples the `` law of non-contradiction '' ?
Actually , there 's a birth every 8 seconds , and a death every 11 seconds , which means the population of the earth grows less than 1 % each year ... so , even with those aborted babies , the world would NOT be overpopulated .
I think that you 're right to point out that both human DNA along with consciousness is necessary since there is life that is conscious but does n't have human DNA ( dogs , cats , etc . ) and there are bodies that have human DNA , yet are dead ( we 're buried with our human DNA intact ) . But I actally disagreewith `` consciousness '' being a necessary quality of `` human beings '' , since it 's unreasonable to believe that we stop being people when we go to sleep . But maybe you have a more nuanced definition of `` consciousness '' .
Well , yes , but this begs the question of whether , even assuming epigenetic inheritance is real , all individuals would experience the same epigenetic alterations . Now , I have no problem with the concept of epigenetic inheritance . But even if it were true it would n't do away with natural selection . Just as with basic genetic mutation , which is n't going to go away , one would expect some individuals to exhibit epigenetic alterations and others not to . This still means a population containing a range of variants that natural selection can act on , preserving some epigenetic alterations as opposed to others . Of course , if the claim is that epigenetic alterations are somehow directed by the environment , i.e . are teleological in origin , then the onus is on the advocates to demonstrate how this direction occurs . Until they do , there is no reason to suppose there is any direction at all .
Not aware ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Not aware of what ? Shoot a gun behind them and they will flinch . They are aware of loud noises . Throw them wildly into the air and they will cry . They are aware of their own movement . Pinch them , they will cry . They are self aware as they chew on their toes . And of course puppies are aware as well . Unless of course I do not understand what you mean by aware .
And you did a quite poor job at it too .
So what you are saying is that the actual purpose of prison is to be raped in the shower by some 400 pound guy called Betty ? Or brutalised by a guard with an inferiority complex ... and these do n't strike you as cruel and unusual ?
And I once had a discussion with a YEC who was a degreed chemist who actually knew what science is and how it works . We had a lengthy discussion about the fossil reactors at Oklo . He limited himself to what he knew - chemistry . The discussion became one of the solubility of various salts and oxides . The chemist could find no information while I did .
That question is a product of flawed reasoning . It is like asking the scientific researcher to test his vaccination on himself . Do you apply that standard to all of your actions and thoughts ? For the scientist it is bad science ; for a thoughtful person it faulty reasoning .
So as a gay man I should be forced to accept hetero marriage . If I am forced to accept hetero marriage they should be forced to accept gay marriage . What part of equal protection do you not understand ? I personally would like to see all displays of all religions wiped fron the public square . No one is going to dictate to me how to live my life based upon some outdated religious belief that I do n't subscribe too .
Then what 's your justification for wanting to make it harder for good people to have access to firearms ? Do you fear something in particular ? Or do you just not like how some people choose to exercise their rights and want them curtailed in a way that makes you feel better ?
Yes , according to JimmyJ . God , the laws regarding murder from all over the world , have absolutely no impact upon the holy proclamations emanating from JimmyJ .
What 's that ? Campaigning and use of taxpayer funded facilities like transportation for political purposes ? I suppose they paid the cops for going out of their jurisdiction too ?
I think he agrees with the `` then '' part because it is a somewhat good description of natural selection . Who knows about the `` if '' part . Could you provide a link ? Also , what is `` 143-142 '' supposed to mean ? Do we read the pages backwards ? I suppose that would explain why you are so confused ...
Well , actually there is . Bat wings for example are one of the easier problems for evolution to solve ( we can even see potential transitional stages in other animals like the flying squirrel ) . The co-option of existing structures is the bread and butter of evolution . Now , if bats and birds had four legs and wings , that would be more of a head-scratcher .
yet cancer cells are not a human being ... good fallacy though . A unique group of cells with a unique DNA would be a human being though ( assuming human DNA ) ... .such as the embryo . You also have it backwards ... giving people the right to live is an american value ... .taking away the want to kill someone is an american value .
Crappola ! I say `` bless you '' when someone sneezes and often identify myself as Catholic as I am from a Catholic family and am in fact `` confirmed '' . That do n't me I actually buy any of it . Do n't try to make Freud out to be a member of `` the flock '' later in life . That 's pure nonsense . Do you know what a figure of speech is ?
Yes , but gays would also want laws changed to accomodate THEIR form of marriage as well . The fact that one requires less change than the other should n't matter , should it ? Should having to do more reworking of laws and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality ? It seems to me your argument boils down to `` polygamy requires more work to make the laws accomodate it . '' Yeah -- such is the price for marriage equality . Let 's face it -- if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for opposite-sex couples which comprise most relationships , they could pull it off -- polygamy , gays , letting 17 year olds marry , etc . All those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed . Means could be set up to determine inheritance , for example . Laws can be worded to do it .
Then you should n't have any problem backing up your claims with some invoices , requests and approval and any Constitutional evidence that you are correct . The fact is , as stated by CNN , Fox and other media is that 14 SCHOOL BUSES were used for transportation . I suppose that would make the school liable if anyone was injured also ? Seems like you are the one with baseless claims ? There is n't anything LIKELY but your desire to support thugs .
But I thought it was the easy gun laws in the U.S. that made Mexico 's cities a shooting gallery ? Same as L.A. and less than D.C. ? Amid Drug War , Mexico Less Deadly Than Decade Ago
So youre saying we would not have clindamycin without the ToE ? The ToE is supposed to be defined as changes in alleles , not changes in anything someone wishes to assign it to . It seems that in addition to the term evolution being broadened to mean just about any change , it is also substituted for the word science at will . Notice how it was done in post # 2 above . The word evolution was dropped , and the word science replaced it . What are the possibilities that evolution is brought in as a narrative gloss after a discovery , rather than being a cornerstone of all of biology , or all of science ? CSC - Why Do We Invoke Darwin ?
Oh . I know it 's not new . Being old does n't make it any more legitimate . Real science can tell the difference between valid and invalid .
It can go both ways . We all doubt . It is what you do with it that matters . [ quote=gnojek ] If a child grew up never hearing the words religion , gods , spirits , etc . would this child still have faith of some sort ? Is faith some innate human tendency ? It could be seeing as how there is the `` god spot '' in the brain , but maybe the god spot would n't develop as fully in the child that was never exposed to religion or thoughts of the supernatural.QUOTE ] Look around . Faith did not spontaneously generate out of thin air . It is obviously part of our psyche . Every civilization throughout history has felt the need for some type of faith . Even on different sides of the planet . It 's as natural as the sun rising .

Abortion does not fit the definition of murder .
Well I do n't believe Jesus said anything directly about abortion but I 'm pretty sure that Jesus would not support abortion since it is murder . To further support my point on this as proving that the child developing inside the mother is not part of the mother but an individual life please click here to read a very important article discussing this issue . -theo
Just an add-on and hopefully thought-provoking .
And the UN seems to feel it 's necessary to spell out that you have the right to marry and have a family .
Maybe someday it will be possible to bridge the gap of time from embryo to the viability of the fetus outside the womb .
And guess who cardinal Joseph Ratzinger is today . Pope Benedict XVI . He was known in the Vatican as `` The Enforcer '' . If you think that the Vatican is giving a free pass to wayward pedophile priests , you 're sadly mistaken .
Good . But seeing how this was proposed over a century and a half ago by Darwin , what took the creationists so long to catch up ?
First , why do n't you do the calculations yourself and tell me the answer you get . The current rate of change of the earth 's rotation is about 2 milliseconds per day per century . US Naval Observatory Please note that this rate is high at the present time because of the current arrangement of the continents . Will get to the rest later
But did n't you know ? The USA is a CHRISTIAN NATION and all other beliefs are subservient to that . They do n't get it , they actally believe that they 're doing good and are also doing it for our own good as well . It is n't terrorists , or any other outside force which are a threat to American rights and freedoms , it is those like the Christian right who you truly have to fear . Those like Pat Robertson , or Jerry Falwel who have influence and many others as well like your President . How many other Judges feel and believe the same as Judge Moore in Alabama did ?
Let me try explaining this another way . According to the logic presented in the original article : Gun Owners : discrimination by gun control laws : : Serial Rapists : discrimination by anti-rape laws You see , it 's the RELATIONSHIP that I 'm comparing . That 's what an analogy is . I 'm NOT comparing the gun owners to the serial rapists , but rather the RELATIONSHIP between discrimination and gun owners as presented in the original article and the RELATIONSHIP between discimination and serial rapists .
They do it on purpose , alright . But not because it 'll be shot down -- in at least one state , the Supreme Court decided that similar legislation did not address more than one issue . The reason they put them together is that , in most states , a ban on civil unions would FAIL .
I believe that a system of rights is superior to a system of democracy . The US by the way , was never intended to be a democracy , but a republic - the difference being that in a republic an individual has his rights respected , while in a democracy the will of majority is the law . The `` right to vote '' or `` right to democracy '' is perhaps the greatest offender in the drama of conflicting rights such made up rights create , because where the will of the majority is law , no other rights can possibly exist .
True . There 's the interpretation that assumes the outcome and then looks for evidence disregarding all that does n't agree . And then there is the interpretation that looks at the evidence and then makes conclusions based on that evidence . You abide to assume the outcome , look for evidence . And you have constantly asserted with absolutely no evidence , that your religious interpretation is correct . Essentially you are soapboxing as nothing you 've said has any empirical basis whatsoever .
I 'm confused by your rationale in your post as it is basically all over the place- perhaps you could clarify your position better . I disagree we are debating philosophy here but discussing far less abstract real world issues and how they relate to the matter of abortion .
I suppose the correct terminology would be that G. fortis evolved a smaller beak due to competition from a larger billed recent imigrant . I suppose that we just are n't subjected to the same word selection pressures this side of the Atlantic . To Ooaman ; This is evolution as observed across a span of a couple of generations , which is the unit that evolutionary change occurs . Obviously a generation of a small bird is n't as long as it is for us , for example .
I know you keep claiming that , but that is not an accurate depiction of reality .
And instead place my faith in the mythology of nomadic herdsmen ? It is much more logical to believe in some all knowing but unknowable magic being who poofed everything into existance and then created all of the evidence to make it appear as if he did n't .
You know I 'm not saying that . Is there no alley you 'd avoid given the chance ? Was she looking for trouble ? Police would certainly want to know what she was doing there .
What if pigs had wings , they would make huge birds . But what do `` what ifs '' have to do with what really happened ? The child did n't die and if it had , it would n't have been an abortion , it would have been between murder at the most , and negligent homicide , if not manslaughter , but not an abortion by any stretch of the law 's interpretation since abortions are legal . And had the fetus died , the cops would have been charged with a crime . This is what 's wrong with the premise of antonia 's thread subject here , yet she could n't discern that before posting this since she was intent on finding an avenue to attack pro-lifers with . And you are as irrational as she is for not seeing through her fallacious argument . After all , she ca n't even see how utterly hypocritical it is to blame pro-lifers for what occurred in this article while remaining oblivious to the carnage her pro-death ideology is responsible for to the tune of 1.4 million innocent children being killed each year in the USA alone .
We could ask you the same thing . Why do you constantly try and oversimplify things by claiming that gun control will work , while at the same time not discussing matters relating to income , surroundings , upbringing , recidivism rates , prison sentences and other such matters ?
So , any creationist want to tell us why these people are so wrong ? Is the international committee a sign of a conspiracy ? Are they trying to hide the fact that radiometric dating techniques do n't work ? Is there really a strong causal relationship between the environmental changes recorded in the rocks and the fossils found there ? Is there really `` missing time '' or was the 85 million years of the Ediacaran Period really contained in 100m of rock ? Is atmospheric oxygen a result of tectonic forces ? Well , what part of this article do creationist object to ?
Here in the Midwest , large numbers of diehard black Democrats voted for Kerry and against gay marriage . It truly was a cross-over issue that transcended party politics .
Are you saying that an argument that is inconsistent with science should not be called unscientific , or are you saying that it should not be rejected because it is unscientific ?
So you subscribe to the inaccurate idea that Irish people are part of a different group to the English people ? Genetics indicate that the UK is made up of a fairly homogenous group of people stretching back for thousands of years ... .
Just because the bible is over 2000 years old does n't make it unreliable , I mean your placing all your money on a billion year old one cell organism . You do n't have any absolute proof and neither do I .
I see that you missed to point . I was correcting you lack of knowledge about carbon 14 dating . You think that you can date fossils of this age with carbon . You also seem to think that you can date rocks with carbon 14 . You ca n't . Time after time you reveal your ignorance by your inability to respond appropriately . KNM-WT 15000 was dated from stratigraphic studies of the area and dating of specific , appropriate rock samples from above and below the fossils .
Well , answering you seems to be a waste of time . You ignore/reject any attempts at explaining the things you clearly do not understand , and youlater bring up the exact same things that you have had explained to you as if the subject was never broached before . You are incorrigible and uneducable .
And once again , is this a strong enough rebuttal to assert proof ? no , Behe assumes that a biochemical system that exists today can not have a precursor , or less complex state of existence . Clive did a good job of demolishing this notion with the mouse trap example he lin the debate thread .
www.you'realiar.com says I 'm right . I 'll respond to the sole credible one you have . http : //www.anth.ucsb.edu/faculty/walker/classes/anth121/121archaic.pdf # search='rhodesian % 20man % 20400 % 2C000 % 20years ' 300,000 It says at least 300,000 years and the rest of your argument supports evolution , even stating some are transitional fossils . Well , you did n't read your article .
You have to remember that those christians believe that the laws of God superceed those of man . That thier allegiance is to God and his laws above those of the constitution . They also believe that all should be subject to Gods by force if nesesary .
You are joking right ?
But your own link says that the rise in crime was partially explained by the new system the UK police were using for recording crime and that the British Crime Survey showed a decrease in crime since 1997 .
What 's a `` kind '' ? Of course , evolution is a slow process so only a fool would expect to see one `` kind '' of animal change into another `` kind . '' But there are some quite good examples in the fossil record . The horse and the whale are two . And the dinosaur to bird line is getting better all the time .
For all we know if the kids in the classroom had guns then this never would 've happened because the shooter would 've known that he 'd be met with a hail of bullets the second he brought out his own guns . This kind of # # # # is what everybody says will happen , but it never does ! Everybody seems to think that it 's best the nobody but the shooter is armed because that 'll somehow yield less deaths than somebody being able to kill the school shooter .
I 'm sure it is many a doctors ' spiritual duty to relieve suffering , just as Jesus healed the sick . Besides , who wants to go back to 40 year average lifespan , like they have in Afghanistan ? Not me .
I know that . Evolution releases itself from its foundation at will . When it wants to speculate about things like abiogenesis and claim it to be science , it allows itself to do that . It 's that interchangeability thing you spoke of above .
Is George Mason some kind of anarchist ? It seems to me that the por-gun people are more and more pushing towards the 'every man for himself , the government can´t protect us , we have to defend our property and way of life ' . Shouldn´t the government be improved instead ? Besides , where I live we have very restrictive gun-laws and I´ve never feeled 'enslaved ' in any way . Ok , a comment to these 'myths ' . First of all , where did you get these facts ? Second of all , no matter how you try , now matter how much statistics you dig forth , no matter how many references to the constitution you do , you can never , ever convince me that harsh gun-restrictions would not reduce the amount of murders and the amount of armed crime . Besides , all people doesn´t share your attitude of : a good criminal is a dead criminal , so those arguments get a bit meaningless .
Your stated stereotype of the person in the story is racist . It 's a racist stereotype and you know it . You 're so entrenched in your own world and nothing outside of it , you would n't know the `` truth '' if came into your face like a lemon meringue pie .
Probably because the 'hate ' is directed at the gun , not the person . Are you defending the rights of racists to exercise their free speech ? I thought 'slander ' was against the law in the US .
well , then why are the doctors trying 2 also test the embyonic cells ? what 's their reason then ? we do n't know , because the doctors might not want everything that they 're doing be on the front page of every newspaper . they have their reasons for their actions , and they just do n't want people like you to know about them . or ... they already have their reasons published and everything and you 're just 2 close-minded 2 take the information in .
And yet now we have returned to a faith-based view of the universe that relies on a Creator acting illogically ( read : deliberately fabricating a false version of reality , with ( for example ) light from the stars sped up in order to reach earth in time ) in order to work . I ca n't help but feel that some of us have moved backwards .
Intelligent design is a recent concept ( not associated with any one religion ) and it has n't had over 100 years to be studied . Why not start now ? It ca n't happen if we block it from future generations . Why not give it a chance , study it , search for evidence , and offer it up for peer review ? What are you afraid of ? That it can mathematically rule out previous evolutionary theories ?
depends on what you consider proof . A beliief that they are is rubbish as it can not be proven . A argument based upon behavior , history and countless examples , well it seems you do n't consider that you be of any use . That sentence does n't even make sense ! I wo n't go into arguing that your claim is right because I do n't believe it .

To which Cone raised an objection similar to :
ADF : NH gov 's proposed revisions to marriage redefinition bill fail religious freedom test - Alliance Defense Fund - Defending Our First Liberty And there it is ... The repeated demand from the anti-gay for SPECIAL PRIVILEGES for the `` religious '' detractors . I fully support CHURCHES and PASTORS from being exempt , but it 's not necessary . Currently , our RELIGIOUS discrimination protection is much stronger than our gay discrimination protection , but do you see churches being forced to perform inter-religion marriage if the church doctrine is against it ? NO ! Do you see atheists saying `` I like the look of this church . I do n't belong , but I 'm going to force you to rent the church for my wedding party anyways . '' ? ? NO ! The existing language and constitutional protections are good enough . But when given more explicit ( redundant ) wording , what do the anti-gay marriage organizations demand ? Something NO GROUP HAS EVER HAD before . They want BUSINESS OWNERS to be free to discriminate if they have `` religious objections '' ... What if their objections are NON-religious in nature ? Why is the religion supposed to get the special perk ? ? ? And as mentioned , NO GROUP HAS EVER HAD this . There were plenty of religious interpretations against black equality and interracial marriage . But did we give THEM special privilege to ignore and discriminate against interracial marriages ? NO ! The really refreshing part of all this ? These whiny temper tantrums just do n't matter ... If the NH legislature includes the religious exceptions ( if they are just reconfirming that churches / pastors do n't have to perform ceremonies they do n't want to ) , then the governor WILL sign it .
What you are talking about is irreducible complexity ; it is the only argument against evolution that appears to be totally immune to rebuttal . I have thought this issue is far over debated like gay issues but perhaps that are because I have an objectivist view point . I do n't suppose any evolutionist have realized that all the evidence for evolution is also evidence for ID . They often talk about the mountains of irrefutable evidence , but the fact that the sun rose and set every day was evidence for the sun orbiting the earth , but it 's also evidence for the earth spinning . Likewise all the evidence for evolution can be condensed into one statement `` life forms are similar to other life forms '' , This is predicted by the intelligent design hypothesis as well . Direct evidence for ID that would not support evolution would be irreducibly complex biology , direct evidence for evolution that would not support ID would be more than just adaptation , it would have to be original useful DNA , or a simulation showing that coherent structure can be achieved without intelligent design by randomization and elimination .

But thats not what unkerpaulie was getting at . Contraceptives deny the possibility of life , just at a different stage . There should be no mystique over conception as a substantial percentage of fertilized embryo 's ( a human life in your estimation ) are going straight down the toliet when nature is left to take its course . At least the Catholic opposition to contraception can be viewed as being morally consistent , ie . there is no man-made intervention permitted in the human reproductive process .
So you are saying that the democrats have no choice but to inaugarate Brown and let him stop the bill ? You suggest that whatever option they pick will be political suicide .
But at least Evolutionist can give physical proofs for their beliefs . It is right that nothing is completely sure and clear , but Evolutionists and Scientists have shown a lot more evidence that shows that Evolution is right , Creationists just ca n't show enough ... ( my opinion ) And it 's right that most stuff Evolutionists are dealing with are millions of years old , but it still all makes more sense than some stuff in the bible ... There is no complete proof for any of the theories , but Evolution just gives more evidence ... And if Creationists just want some credit for their beliefs and work , they should n't want evolution to be deleted vom Education . No one knows what is right but right now the theories of Evolution just shows more evidence and is widely accepted and used ...
And you should be able to do this even if it might hurt someone else ... abortion kills another human , drinking and driving might hurt kill another human , firing a gun in the privacy of your own home might hurt someone but it is in private so I do n't give a damn what someone else thinks . -- -- Anyway , I see you guys still wo n't admit that Planned Parenthood is wrong about the facts and is misleading women everywhere ... but thats ok because you like these facts .
And more importantly , where 's my damn prize ?
I googled your signature , and I found this just before your quote mine : `` Some of the most mythic of scientific notions lie in the realm of evolutionary biology . Evolution  the proposition that all organisms are related  is as highly verified a thesis as can be found in science . Subjected to close scrutiny from all angles for over a century now , evolution emerges as the only naturalistic explanation we have of the twin patterns of similarity and diversity that pervade all life . The basic notion that life has evolved is as certain as the existence of gravity or the idea that the earth is spheroidal . We call such highly verified notions facts when they consistently escape all attempts to prove them false . Evolution is no myth . '' Finally , please present evidence .
Then you need no other reason . The only reason I need to have any kind of legal firearm is that : I want one . I need no other reason .
Are you sure ? Love is an emotion . Do my cat and my dog love me ? They certainly have emotions . Tell you what . Why do n't you propose a method by which `` love '' can be quantified . That way there would be no question as to whether it was scientific or not . I think that it comes back to your constant insistance that science denies anything that is non-material just because science admits a lack of tools to study the topic . Put up or shut up . How can I measure the love for my wife and children and quantify it . Do I have a limited amount of love such that I love my wife less because I also love my children ? Do I love one child more ? How is this scientific ? Are you so unable to grasp the ideas expressed that you still have n't realized that naturalistic science does not deny that there are things that can not be measured by science . Science does not deny any god . Neither can it support a god .
So why are you so afraid of it ? If it is bad you will have a choice to go to a private insurance company .
No thanks . There are other ways to meet dates . It 's very easy for gays to meet dates that are not officially gay .
But you still feel they have the right idea when it comes to firearms ?
Just be like the Jews and Christians and steal the idea ! A lot of their mythology is n't original : it was stolen from other people who thought it up first .
What is information ? Natural selection is one of the most important mechanisms of evolution . You see , there is no requirement in evolutionary theory that there be an increase in information . Someone lied to you and you did n't know enough to realize it . You just took it because it is what you wanted to hear .
Well then the courts must be insane . Because I 'm sure there are some gun control laws that they 're struck down due to their ineffectiveness .
It is ALL repeated time after time , and time again then again . But you are correct . Here is one of the links to those studies . The Continual Appearance of the Slippery Slope Fallacy But what do we do about this ? http : //works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcon ... dennis_culhane Which is a study of criminals shooting criminals but it is hoped that people will think it is about Law Abiding Concealed Carry . This is NOT representative of Law-abiding Concealed Carry or legal gun ownership in any way . And we have this . Guns and Death - Firearms Research - Harvard Injury Control Research Center - Harvard School of Public Health So lets look at the actual crime figures to see if any of this holds water . According to this 1999 article there were 250 million guns in circulation in 1999 . Total NICS Background Checks November 30 , 1998 - June 30 , 2009
Actually , creationists have n't studied this further . That would imply actually condisering the evidence . The creationist stories you will find wo n't be `` study '' but just ad hoc stories with no more foundation in fact than the Bible myths themselves .
This is not true or requires at least more justification .
So how are those gun free zones working out for you ?
Now everyone will know Marc was right all along -- that there is an atheist science conspiracy .
Makes about as much sense as saying many of the car hating crowd ( people who support such laws as car registration ) also own cars . More evidence that your handlers have trained you to see the world in black and white .
She made no such `` declaration '' . I suggest you re-read what was reported , and consult a dictionary .
Okay , you are right ... we need a definition for a 'hole , ' as it is a bit of a subjective concept . Allow me to define 'hole ' like this : The void created by the intentional destruction of something already in existence . Using 'hole ' with this definition makes Alcorn 's statement ( minus the word 'terrible ' ) a true fact in the physical realm . And it precludes any of your other ideas from creating 'holes , ' since they all deal with potentiality , not reality .
The prediction was NOT made based on the theory of evolution , but on the fact that there were fossils up until a certain time , then there were no more fossils and nobody had seen the thing . What 's so hard to understand here ?
Look , bub , if you 're trying to paint nonbelievers and unfair because we accept Homer as the author of epics while rejecting Moses as the author of the Pentateuch or Matthew as the author of the book of Matthew , then you 're lying : we put equal scrutiny into these questions , and -- as you can see , despite your claims to the contrary -- we do n't swallow the claim that Homer wrote these epics the way we know people write books and poems today . More importantly , there are n't ( as far as I know ) absurdities that make it obvious that Homer did n't write the Iliad or The Odyssey . This is n't true of the Bible : How could Moses have written that no man as humble as Moses came before or after Moses ? ( And would n't that be pretty damn un-humble for the humblest man ever to say ? )
I think it would be an exception as well . But if you see an indicator that might point to an `` exception '' , I think the question should be asked . Consider the flip side of things . The question does n't get asked . If Skip had been the type of man to let a gay couple 's house burn to spite gays , do n't you think that the gay couple would have had grounds to sue the city in such a situation ? Part of this is just the city covering its own XXX . If they ask the question , and the guy lies , they have helped to cover their own XXX by asking the question .
I 'm not familiar with the book , so ca n't comment upon it first hand . However http : //www.ncseweb.org/icons/ appears to have a detailed critique of the book and may be of interest to you too . As I say I have n't read the original so can not judge the quality of the link I 'm supplying , so apologies in advance if it grossly misrepresents Mr Well 's case .
Are you sure ? VOR is a 14 year old kid from Florida . His IP is squarely from a ISP from Florida . If he is retired , he is the first person I have ever heard who was 60+ that used slang normally reserved for street gangs . Not to mention that his war stories place him in two different seas at the same time . Somehow 2 tours turned into 4 , midlevel ship officer turned into high ranking military advisor . All in all , VOR is far more of a liability to any of his allies because of his lying , lack of education and reading comphrension problems .
See above .

Ok , if Max is a hillbilly for his punctuation , then you , Ray , aspire to hillbilly-hood ! Max hitting some typos while talking about other 's intelligence was funny . You going after someone 's English is just plain ludicrous ! Do you really not know how awful your writing is ?
Just in case you missed it :
But it should be the job of science to establish a clear line between just where established fact stops and philosophy starts . There 's no indication that they 're getting it done .
No need for further evidence why this law would be dangerous to those who do not think exactly like you do ! Instead of calling it a government terrorist watch list , we should just drop the pretension and call it what it would be come . The Democrat Political Enemies Terrorist Wish List ! : lol : Bloomberg : Deny Second Amendment to People on Terror Watch List
How do you `` interpret '' all those extant historical records bracketing the `` flood '' date by several hundred years , as shown by sinjin , which record no such event ?
My bet is that it wo n't be natural selection .
Oh yes , the 'subtext ' .
Who said anything about banning it ?
Exactamundo , finally the ignoramus gets something right .
I believe prochoice people support choice . I do n't know what proabortion people support . I 've never met one .
How else should it be done ? It is a constiturionally protected right . To eliminate that right , the constitutional protection must be removed first , is the removal itself , becomes unconstitutional .
Actually I think it is defined by the creator who created all women But in reality your opinion is gibberish . Equality is , like every other word , defined by the people who use the language . Currently it means `` the same '' . People are n't equal because they are not all the same . Any attempt to argue otherwise is a display of gross stupidity .
That , of course , is the logical fallacy known as 'Personal incredibility '' . The concept he promoted of `` irreducilble complex '' has been shown to be devoid of any meaning . All example he showed of 'gaps ' in systems he proclaimed to be 'irredibly complex ' have been shown to be reducible . Some were even found to be reducible even BEFORE his book `` Darwin 's black box ' was published . Those gaps in knowledge were filled in . What Behe was basiclaly saying is 'Gosh , we do n't know , it must have been God ' . We found out . God retreats . Yes , there are unknowns , and probably always will be . But our ignornace is not evidence of an intelligent designer . To promote an intelligent designer as a scientific theory , you have to have evidence FOR an intellient designer , rather than gaps in the knowlege of how biochemical systems formed . Believing in a God is fine , but it is n't science .
It logically follows from the moral foundation set up but you made to important claims or `` proclamations '' as you called it . 1 ) Treat others as you wish to be treated ( golden rule ) and 2 ) Mental existence is required to have value My morality was already nicely summed up by you ( atleast part of it )
And teen sex does n't , by the very nature of it 's action , result in ending a life that would grow into a toddler , a child , an adolescent , and an adult -- basically the action of killing someone .
Was n't sinjin crowing about his plans to take the family , wife and children , to the fair this weekend because it `` was so safe since normal folks could n't carry in that gun free pardise ? '' Insane killer escapes on field trip to county fair - Yahoo ! News
Hi Smallax , welcome to the forum . I did a search and have found some products which might give you an idea about costs and concepts for performing such an experiment . It sounds interesting by the way . First , I found Glass Bell jars that are safe at high pressure . https : //www1.fishersci.com/wps/porta ... =y & amp ; fromSearch= Here 's a Nalgene vacuum chamber as another option to the Bell Jar depending on the pressure you 're going to use . https : //www1.fishersci.com/wps/porta ... =y & amp ; fromSearch= Here 's a motor driven vacuum pump : https : //www1.fishersci.com/wps/porta ... =y & amp ; fromSearch= Here 's a precalibrated absolute zero apparatus : https : //www1.fishersci.com/wps/porta ... =y & amp ; fromSearch= This link gives a wide range of products that you might want to be aware of for a wider selection of potential equipment : https : //www1.fishersci.com/wps/porta ... & amp ; catCode=SE_SC Here 's a fiber optic system which is interesting and utilizes natural light : Huvco Daylighing Solutions | Parans Fiber Optic Systems | Tubular Skylights | High Performance Skylights Here 's another design but is a different company : SUNLIGHT DIRECT Keep us informed if you run the experiment . I 'd be interested in the results .
