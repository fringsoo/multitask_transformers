I said the Brady Campaign and other gun control groups made the statement of California being safe . Their message is that gun control makes people safer . They gave California an A rating for their high levels of gun control . Putting those two facts together they 're endorsing California as being a safe state .
I have never , once , seen a Creationist actually make a list of what the kinds are , and what animals belong to them .

On this 35th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision , I would like to share my views on the issue of abortion . Life begins at the point of conception . No one can deny that after a human being is conceived it will develop into the very same being as those debating this issue . What astounds me is that those who favor abortion went through an identical development stage as the being they are condemning to death . Would these very same people agree that a similiar choice should have been made about their own existence ? Abortion today is used primarily as a birth control of convenience because people are too self-centered to take precautions . They prefer their own pleasurable self-indulgence over the care and sanctity of the life they created . What ever happened to taking responsibility for one 's actions in this country ? Is it too much to ask a woman who has conceived to place the child into adoption ? Nine months of discomfort is nothing compared to life in prison for voluntary manslaughter ! Does the father of the child have a say in this ? And what about the constitution of the United States ? Are not all people conceived in this country deserving of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness ? I believe abortion is a crime against humanity and should be outlawed . We need to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision and get back to cherishing life in this country . For a country that murders it 's children can not be far from self destruction .

Why not read `` The Science of ConsciousnessThe Next Scientific Paradigm '' by William A. Guillory , Ph.D. which states in part ... `` The Science of Consciousness is essentially the study of the non-material world . It is the study of metaphysical phenomena that , for the most part , are not subject to the theories and laws of Newtonian-Cartesian science . However , the human implications of the results of studying consciousness , beyond the physical realm , are immense . '' http : //creativityandinquiry.org/Scie ... ciousness.html Consciousness is non-material . Perhaps reading `` Empirical Evidence for the Non-Material Nature of Consciousness '' by Juleon M. Schins might shed some light .

If you want to see whether guns save lives , you need to look at their impact on total killing rates , not only their impact on gun-killing rates . The fact you choose to examine a misleading statistic indicates to me you are aware that you are wrong .

PLANET OF THE APES THING= Unfortunatly for us , yes . And very likely if we just disappered . RELIGION THING= As I said humans follow three catgories , self-preservation , the soical thing , and the need to continue or better the species . We see in the very long term , and have high orders of reasoning that allow us to get what we want . That is how we got here , but we see death as something outside our long-term ability to plan for , and that just messes with the need for self-preservation . So , because we are creatures that need to have answers ( not because god said so , but because creatures that want the answer on how to get that peice of fruit up in that tree to fall down , will do better then the creature that dose n't care ) , we create eloborate teachings that allow us to incorporate death into our long-term plans , and that takes away from the whole self-preservation fear . No offense to religious guys , but seriously if you think about it , is n't it convinent that god will let us into heaven . Every culture has some version of eternity written into its teachings , weither it be heaven , rebirth or some nature thing it is what we want to believe . I admit in my weaker momments I have really wished I did believe in some kind of god , but the fact remains , most of our lives we act on complex instinct . The thing that seperates us now that we have got metaphorically `` Situated '' as a civilization is the few moments we walk in to transedental territory . That time we figure out the math problem , that time we figure out the riddle , that , more then anything , is the definition of consiousness I go by . Everything else in life , religion , love , hate etc . are just things we use to satisfy our base needs ( re-read my first post for clarification ) but those seconds , when we finally grasp an idea , when it dose n't change us in any way , but we feel profoundly happy at our own ability to grasp the riddle , math problem , board game etc . is something no other animal feels . They may feel happy at having , going back to the fruit in a tree example , knocked the fruit out of the tree , and are happy now because they get to eat the fruit . Humanity is `` sentient '' because we enjoy the fact that we knocked the fruit out of the tree more then we enjoy the fruit itself . Atleast thats what I think defines consiousness I could be wrong , but I know for sure what dose n't and religion is something any animal with enough reasoning and foresight would invent .

Hydrothermal vents [ 4 ] are described in two books of the Bible written before 1400BCmore than 3,000 years before their discovery by science .

Imagine being one of those guys in the Alien movies and you 've got a chestburster in you that 's gon na kill you once its fully gestated , but you 're not allowed to have an operation to have it removed from your body because of an intergalatic treaty declaring that all life is precious and must be observed .
Third , the violinist illustration is not parallel to pregnancy because it equates a stranger/stranger relationship with a mother/child relationship . This is a key point and brings into focus the most dangerous presumption of the violinist illustration , also echoed in McDonagh 's thesis . Both presume it is unreasonable to expect a mother to have any obligations towards her own child . The violinist analogy suggests that a mother has no more responsibility for the welfare of her child than she has to a total stranger . McDonagh 's view is even worse . She argues the child is not merely a stranger , but a violent assailant the mother needs to ward off in self-defense . This error becomes immediately evident if we amend Thompson 's illustration . What if the mother woke up from an accident to find herself surgically connected to her own child ? What kind of mother would willingly cut the life-support system to her two-year-old in a situation like that ? And what would we think of her if she did ? Blood relationships are never based on choice , yet they entail moral obligations , nonetheless . This is why the courts prosecute negligent parents . They have consistently ruled , for example , that fathers have an obligation to support their children even if they are unplanned and unwanted . If it is moral for a mother to deny her child the necessities of life ( through abortion ) before it is born , how can she be obligated to provide the same necessities after he 's born ? Remember , Thompson concedes that the fetus is a person from the moment of conception . If her argument works to justify abortion , it works just as well to justify killing any dependent child . After all , a two-year-old makes a much greater demand on a woman than a developing unborn .

Very interesting Matt . A little confused are you ? What on earth makes you think that a gay men could succeed in seducing a straight man , and a lesbian could seduce a straight woman . Of course there always are exceptions . Some people will do anything for money .
First thing I want to say is that I dont want to offend anyone but for me abortion was the best option . I also want to say that I love Christ will all my heart . He has forgiven me for my sins and because ive had an abortion does not mean im not a Christian and yes I was a christian when I did have an abortion . I had an abortion just this past june . ... I grew up in a christian home and was anti abortion most of my life but honestly I felt so relieved after having the abortion .
The biggest thing that really # # # # # # me off though are the carry laws where I live ( california ) . Essentially , you ca n't get a concealed carry permit in California ( I say essentially because technically they are allowed to issue them , but it 's essentially only for celebrities and political figures ) . so ... let me get this straight ... I can own my handgun for self-defense , but it 's illegal for me to carry it to defend against a threat . But then again , the muggers wont have concealed weapons also , right ? Of course not , because it is illegal to carry it with you , and muggers and other criminals have a high amount of respect for the law .

Yes , it is interesting how we draw an arbitary `` legal line in the sand '' with regards to determining how late into a pregnancy an elective abortion is available .

A lot of people feel safer when they have got a gun in their home , cause then you always can use it , even when you are drunk or something like that .

In principle , there is no difference between the two as the result is the same , a dead baby . I 've always disliked this line of logic because it implies that the value of somebody 's life depends on their relative accomplishments and it invites the counter argument that the unborn in question could also become a criminal . Indeed , it has been argued that abortion has reduced crime , poverty , overpopulation and the depletion of natural resources .

Premise 1 : God lives in another universe ( Heaven ) and therefore can not be detected in this universe . ( Definition of God ) Premise 2 : If something exists , then it can be detected/sensed . ( Definition of Existence ) Contrapositive of Premise 2 : If something can not be detected/sensed , then it does not exist . Conclusion : God does not exist . The reason that this doens't prove Atheism is that it can not disprove the existence of , say , the Hindu gods , which are defined as beings in this world that can be seen . It just disproves theism .

Sorry , I also meant to talk about safety , not control . But I don´t think that zero-gun-tolerance at schools would be a conflict to gun-safety courses . If the teachers of this subject start with something like `` I´ll tell you about safety but a gun is evil , evil ! `` , then it there would be much sense . Imo the goal of the subject had to be that children know about the dangers of guns . Idiotic parents forget to keep away their guns from kids too often . At least the kids should know about that `` chrome toy on the table '' .

Of course , no species of coelacanth living today is like the ones found in the fossil record . The fossil coelacanths are small , freshwater fish .

Certainly most people accept 'evolution ' per se . The OP stats for the USA , I suspect , apply not to 'evolution ' in se , but rather to the darwinian RMNS explanation for it . Whether that is the case or not , there is absolutely no law in science that a person doing a certain job has to pay more than lip service to any metaphysical postulate seemingly required for the job . If RC priests can spend their adult lives saying mass , hearing confessions , and buggering little boys , then its no big deal for biologists , let alone any other scientist , to just pay the required obsequities to RMNS , stuff it on a mental back-shelf , and just get on with what they do everyday .
I am personally saddened that the Pope would take the words of fallible man above the Word of God for whom he serves . Is this not putting man 's word ( who was n't there ) above God 's Word ( who was there ) ? I am just thankful that we have ministries like AiG and ICR who stand up for God 's Word - The Bible - and defend it from the very first verse .
That would most likely ( imo ) reduce the number of abortions performed . It would depend , I think , on how viable it is to transfer the embryo into the artificial womb . Forced surgery would not be an option if I had anything to do about it .
That would be beating the bejesus out of a kid as opposed to teaching him or her how to govern his or her impulses by themselves .

Not really , this case was different in that the state was the guardian . Although I am sure it has happened before . As for three reasons ... 1 ) The state of Florida does n't believe a 13 yr old can have sex ( consent ) so why couold she be able to cosent to an abortion ? 2 ) The State is the guardian and they should be able to say where she can and ca n't go as a parent would be able to do ... .and the state has a law against taking kids to abortion clinics . 3 ) ABORTION IS KILLING A KID . Maybe that does n't matter for most : -/

And there it is in black and off-white : you ca n't find any fault with common descent or evolution , so you shoehorn in something to which evolution does not speak .
This would also explain why evolutionists can not give us any example of random mutations that could lead to cumulative selection -- because they do n't exist .

If the child is to be born into a poverty stricken part of the world and is expected to die by the age of 7 by either disease or lack of food , why not spare pain and abort ?

Court : Seattle police OK to stun pregnant woman By GENE JOHNSON & # 8232 ; ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER SEATTLE -- Three Seattle police officers were justified when they used a stun gun on a pregnant mother who refused to sign a traffic ticket , a federal appeals court ruled Friday in a case that prompted an incredulous dissent . Malaika Brooks was driving her son to Seattle 's African American Academy in 2004 when she was stopped for doing 32 mph in a school zone . She insisted it was the car in front of her that was speeding , and refused to sign the ticket because she thought she 'd be admitting guilt . Rather than give her the ticket and let her go on her way , the officers decided to arrest her . One reached in , turned off her car and dropped the keys on the floor . Brooks stiffened her arms against the steering wheel and told the officers she was pregnant , but refused to get out , even after they threatened to stun her . The officers - Sgt . Steven Daman , Officer Juan Ornelas and Officer Donald Jones - then stunned her three times , in the thigh , shoulder and neck , and hauled her out of the car , laying her face-down in the street . Brooks gave birth to a healthy baby two months later , but has permanent scars from the Taser . She sued the officers for violating her constitutional rights , and U.S. District Judge Richard Jones allowed the case to continue . He declined to grant the officers immunity for performing their official duties and said Brooks ' rights were clearly violated . But in a 2-1 ruling Friday , a panel of the 9th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed . Judges Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain held that the officers were justified in making an arrest because Brooks was obstructing them and resisting arrest . The use of force was also justified because of the threat Brooks posed , Hall wrote : `` It seems clear that Brooks was not going to be able to harm anyone with her car at a moment 's notice . Nonetheless , some threat she might retrieve the keys and drive off erratically remained , particularly given her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation . '' They also noted that the force used was n't that serious because the Taser was in `` touch '' mode rather than `` dart '' mode , which hurts more . They reversed the lower court 's opinion and held that the officers were entitled to immunity from the lawsuit . The officers ' lawyers , Ted Buck and Karen Cobb , said the officers made the right decision under the circumstances they faced . `` Police officers have to have the ability to compel people to obey their lawful orders , '' Buck said . That 's all the court recognized today . The 9th Circuit just applied the law instead of getting caught up in the otherwise unfortunate factual circumstances . '' The majority 's opinion outraged Judge Marsha Berzon , who called it `` off the wall . '' `` I fail utterly to comprehend how my colleagues are able to conclude that it was objectively reasonable to use any force against Brooks , let alone three activations of a Taser , in response to such a trivial offense , '' she wrote . She argued that under Washington law , the officers had no authority to take Brooks into custody : Failure to sign a traffic infraction is not an arrestable offense , and it 's not illegal to resist an unlawful arrest . Berzon said the majority 's notion that Brooks obstructed officers was so far-fetched that even the officers themselves did n't make that legal argument . To obstruct an officer , one must obstruct the officer 's official duties , and the officers ' only duties in this case were to detain Brooks long enough to identify her , check for warrants , write up the citation and give it to her . Brooks ' failure to sign did not interfere with those duties , she said . Furthermore , Brooks posed no apparent threat , and the officers could not have known how stunning her would affect the fetus , or whether it might prompt premature labor - another reason their actions were inexcusable , Berzon said . Brooks ' lawyer , Eric Zubel , said he would ask the 9th Circuit to rehear the case . `` This is outrageous - that something like this could happen to a pregnant woman , in front of an elementary school , at 8:30 in the morning , to someone who posed no threat whatsoever , '' he said .

SIOUX FALLS , S.D .  In the fight to preserve the toughest abortion ban in the nation , the talk is not of a fetus ' right to life . It 's of a woman 's right to motherhood . Antiabortion activists here deliberately avoid the familiar slogans of their movement . They do n't talk about the `` murder of innocent babies '' or quote the Bible on the sanctity of life . Instead , campaign manager Leslee Unruh has taken what she calls a feminist approach , arguing that legalized abortion exploits women and  for their sake  must be stopped . ADVERTISEMENT The bumper stickers and T-shirts that fill campaign headquarters spell out her message , in pink and blue : `` Abortion Hurts Women . '' `` We women buy the choice line . We 're panicked , or we 're being pressured , or we 're ashamed to have a child outside marriage , '' Unruh said . She speaks from personal experience ; she had an abortion nearly 30 years ago and said her life since has been darkened with regret and longing . `` If you do n't do your job right as a mother , '' Unruh asked , `` what good is everything else ? '' Abortion-rights supporters call such rhetoric patronizing and presumptuous ; they say many women find that ending unwanted pregnancies brings relief and the freedom to pursue other dreams . But they acknowledge that Unruh 's tactic is effective  and that it has thrown their campaign off balance . `` Historically , this debate has been focused on fetal rights , fetal life . We have a lot of language about that , '' said Sarah Stoesz , president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood of Minnesota and North and South Dakota . `` This adds an element we 're not accustomed to . It 's a different line of debate . And that is something we struggle with politically . '' The ban , passed overwhelmingly by the South Dakota Legislature in February , makes it a felony to help any woman terminate a pregnancy at any stage , unless an abortion is necessary to prevent her death . Women would not face criminal charges , but their doctors could get up to five years in prison . Rather than challenge the law in court , Planned Parenthood chose to put it to a public referendum , gambling that people would vote to repeal it on Nov. 7 . ( South Dakota law permits interest groups to refer legislation to the ballot if they can collect enough signatures . ) If voters reject the ban , abortion-rights advocates hope it will deter states such as Ohio , Indiana , Missouri , Georgia and Rhode Island , which have been considering similar measures . If the ban is upheld , Planned Parenthood will challenge it in court . Antiabortion leaders would welcome that battle . They hope the U.S. Supreme Court will use the case to overturn Roe vs. Wade , the 1973 ruling that found a constitutional right to abortion . Both sides call this election crucial and are putting out urgent appeals to raise millions of dollars for the fight . But if this is the frontline of the abortion wars , the guns sound oddly muted . Attuned to the values of this very conservative state , abortion-rights activists have decided not to make a stand on a woman 's right to choose . The big poster outside their campaign headquarters makes a much milder point : `` This law simply goes too far . '' One of their TV ads starts out : `` South Dakotans agree , honor and protect human life . '' The ad goes on to affirm support for reducing the number of abortions , but argues that the law is too inflexible . The only exception in the law states physicians will not be prosecuted for procedures `` intended to prevent the death of a pregnant mother . '' Even then , however , doctors must try their best to save `` the life of her unborn child . '' A provision allows women to use the morning-after pill , which can prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours of sex . But under South Dakota law , pharmacists are not required to dispense the pill  or refer women to a pharmacy that will . And the Legislature has repeatedly voted down a bill to require emergency rooms to stock the contraceptive . Walking a neighborhood of gracious homes the other day to rally voters against the law , Emma Tupper , 20 , made just one pitch , again and again . `` Our main concern is the lack of exception for rape and incest , '' she said . Some residents nodded and pledged to vote against the ban . Nearly as many politely said they would support it . `` Even if there 's no exception for rape and incest ? '' Tupper asked one elderly man . `` I 've looked at the bill pretty closely , and I feel comfortable with my decision , '' he replied , and closed the door . Tupper  who came from Seattle to work on this campaign  walked on , crunching through drifts of yellow leaves . `` It 's a tough state , '' she said . An independent Mason-Dixon poll in June found voters opposed to the ban , 47 % to 39 % . But a Zogby International survey last month , commissioned by an antiabortion group in Washington , D.C. , found that gap had narrowed to 47 % to 44 % . In another unsettling sign for abortion-rights supporters , four Republican state senators who opposed the ban lost their seats in the primary election this summer . `` I do n't know if I want to say we have a lot of momentum , '' said Jan Nicolay , a former Republican legislator working to overturn the ban .

The New Haven , CT plant that produced the Gun That Won The West closed . The venerable Winchester line of guns is no more , despite a heroic two month effort to find a buyer . I have a hard time believing someone will not try to resurrect the name , but perhaps it 's best to let it die away . Certainly , it should not suffer its name on inferior product lines . We 've allowed other great names , like Spencer , to become extinct . But what exactly killed it ? Just another American manufacturer unable to compete ?
From a Biological standpoint life begins at the moment of conception . So abortion is in fact killing off life . Have any of you ever seen a partial birth abortion ?

1 ) It 's hardly `` solved '' .Same-sex marriage is not legal in France . As of 2006 , one same-sex marriage ceremony has been conducted in France and was declared void . France has a statute authorizing civil unions , known as PACS , between same-sex and unmarried opposite-sex couples . Same-sex marriage was an issue in the 2007 presidential election , with the Conservative UMP opposing it and the Socialist Party supporting it , though both candidates support civil unions ( PACS ) . ... . On June 5 , 2004 , former Green Party presidential candidate Noël Mamère , Mayor of the Bordeaux suburb of Bègles , conducted a same-sex marriage ceremony for two men , Bertrand Charpentier and Stéphane Chapin . Mamère claimed that there was nothing in French law to prohibit such a ceremony , and that he would appeal any challenge to the European Court of Human Rights . French Justice Minister Dominique Perben had stated that such unions would be legally void , and called for judicial intervention to halt the ceremony.Same-sex marriage in France - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia What France has is `` well , both the blacks and the whites can enter by the side-door , but only the whites can enter by the main door '' We would n't find such an `` acommodation '' satisfactory for blacks . And furthermore , I think you would find that it 's the ANTI-GAYS who have the problem with this . If Obama is able to try to put up `` civil unions '' on the federal level , you can bet dollars to doughnuts it will be the religious right who fight him . Not the gays ...
A consequence of the pro-choice position would mean the man does n't pay child support unless he wants to . It is irrelevant who carries the child . Maybe he is not ready for a child ... this is the same excuse allowable for women under the pro-choice argument . So he should n't have to pay it if he does n't want to . In fact , alimony she go the same way under the pro-choice thinking . If not then you just look like a hypocrite .
You 're an extremist of the most dangerous kind Brady , and you have lost all credibility as an objective concerned citizen who is seeking balanced gun policies . You have an anti-constitutional agenda that works to disarm honest people in favor of criminals who will never obey the laws to disarm if you ever succeeded in you goals . In my opinion , you and your ilk are as dangerous a threat to America as the terrorists who have openly vowed to destroy us .

Another thing that is quite clear ( or at least should be ) is that there will never be a way to `` fight '' TOE with God - it 's just not gon na happen ... ever .

I find one comment extremely absurd , by a board member who voted for the new standards : `` It gets rid of a lot of dogma that 's being taught in the classroom today , '' said board member John Bacon .

You know , I think that you are rather an evil person , trying to create guilt where no guilt exists , where no guilt is necessary . Someone made a very important decision at a critical point in her life which made her life better and averted the consequences of a stupid mistake made by a youth . It was not an easy decision for her to make but she made it and it 's well in the past , except for the people who want her to feel guilt and trauma about it .
Because if evolution can not explain all changes it is false , Unless you propose some creatures evolved and some were specially created . Is that what you mean ?
First of all , is evolution defined as the development of new body parts on organisms ? Define evolution before you start arguing about what constitutes as evidence for or against it .
2 ) The term `` marriage '' is not exclusively reserved for a union between man and woman . The term can also describe the joining of anything ( ie . `` the marriage of words and music in a hit song '' , `` new lipstick is a beautiful marriage of fragrance and texture '' , `` marriage of these companies will be successful '' , etc ) . Is it not possible marriage can also be used to describe gay unions ?
The problem is that the US has , in the past , refused funding to any organisation that , even as part of its activities , offered advice to women regarding abortion . Even when the women in question are on their 7th or 8th pregnancy and their husband refuses to use a condom , and the kids they already have do n't have enough to eat .
I accept that the theory of evolution explains the observations both gentically represented and those of the fossil record .
Nice job moving the goalpost , and changing the subject also . Show where in BCR 's post which you quoted above , he said even spoke to the issue of genes ? He said no new functions have evolved in a population in which it has n't existed before . And regarding your fallacious example regarding nylon eating bacteria , are you suggesting that the chemical ingredients that make nylon never existed before man combined them to create nylon ? The bacteria works on a microscopic level and could n't care less what product we have made from those chemicals which it thrives on . So your example is both fallacious and moot .
I agree ... it 's just too bad sometimes with young adults they do n't think about what might happen , they just respond with natural urges . And this results sometimes is someone becoming `` with child `` even though it was not what they set out to do ! So should we force them to have the child and put it up for adoption ? If so consider there are lots of children waiting to be taken in and most of them are n't infants .

Many evolutionists are pretty bright , yes , No one can deny that .
I do n't know if I can accept `` creationist science '' as a true form of science . True science involves developing explanations for phenomena based on ALL available evidence gathered . Creationists pick and choose little bits of science that supports their claims , all the while ignoring the evidence that discredits them .
Oh it will and from what I have seen of the arguments the court will strike down prop 8 and every anti gay marriage amendment . I have seen the reinactments taken from the trial record .
I did n't go into enough detail with respect to unmarried hetero couples . Right now , most states have `` common law '' marriage statutes in which a partner of the opposite sex can lay claim to a portion of their unmarried partner 's property if they 've lived together for a defined period of time . Allowing gay marriage without also rewriting common law statutes discriminates against unmarried heteros living together . Without legal gay marriage , gay partners do n't have to worry about common law statutes being used against them by their partner . Does that explain it better ?
I think you are entirely correct . From the page VOR linked : There is no evidence ANYWHERE that the second ammendment is a collective right . We ghave been over this multiple times , and the evidence simply does not exist , and an organization like the ACLU should be well aware of this .

I was requested to start a new thread in which pro-gay and anti-gay marriage positions could be debated without posters being called `` homophobes '' , `` gay bashers '' and `` bigots '' simply because they do n't favor gay marriage . While I '' ve already stated why I 'm against gay marriage in previous threads , I 'll reiterate them here for newbies and for simplicity sake . 1 . Gay marriage creates a new dependent class of citizen 2 . It is an unfunded mandate and therefore , illegal 3 . It forces additional costs on an employer via healthcare benefits 4 . It adds costs to the court system via increased litigation over custody , property , inheritance , etc. , 5 . It allows more people to lay claim to finite SS and other entitlement benefits 6 . It establishes a loophole to transfer property without payment of inheritance taxes . 7 . It establishes a mechanism to bypass the payment of taxes on life insurance payouts . These should be enough fodder to get the ball rolling .
I find it interesting that the stars create the clouds and inturn the clouds form into stars . One vicious cycle with no begining . In a forum devoted to origin you offer the explainiation of no origin at all but rather meaningless existence . This is the main problem I have with evolution and it 's application to physical sciences . A cycle with no begining has indeed no forseeable end . Therefore on a personal level I have no hope of changing anything . Things were , are and will continue to be this cycle of events . As this applies to biology any other life sciences . My actions are only the result of my animal instict . I am not playing the inner - child but rather the inner - beast . No law is passed to keep a beast in submission to another beast . Governing bodies fail if there is no accountablity . That is the cruix of the discussion . I am accoutable to God . If I am wrong about creation , I have only missed out on a lifetime of animal behavior . If you are wrong about evolution , then I fear you are far the worse off then I .

The following is summarized mostly from an article by George Cook in the December 1999 issue of the Quarterly Review of Biology . Many of the details of the research that ruled out Lamarckianism are no longer taught to Biology undergrads because the old controversies are no longer in the slightest bit controversial , and the field has moved on to much more interesting debates . The students are simply taught that Lamarckianism is an egregiously failed concept . Back in the 1890 's August Weismann and Herbert Spencer argued at length over the possibility of Lamarckian evolution ( Spencer for , Weismann against ) . Supporters of Herbert Spencer , notably the paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn , realized that this issue could only be settled experimentally , so he and his colleagues called for an institute to be set up to run the appropriate experiments . This ultimately lead to the Station for Experimental Evolution at Cold Spring Harbor in New York , and it also persuaded a lot of biologists of all stripes to research the controversy and run experiments . Ultimately this all came to naught after 15-30 years because even the most ardent supporters of Lamarckian evolution recognized that they had had no successes in demonstrating Lamarckian evolution For example , Bumpus 's four famous studies failed to detect any self-adaptation in transplanted stocks of animals . Specifically , Bumpus ( 1898 ) found increased variation but no beneficial self-adaptation in stocks of birds transplanted to new habitats where they lacked their previous heavy predation . In a subsequent study he transplanted both groups ( the old original and the more diverse offshoot group ) to a third location , and showed that each group continued true to type , notably including the higher variation of the group that had been released from heavy predation loads . This showed that the initial change had been evolutionary in nature , and that the creatures were unable to quickly modify themselves to a new ideal . ... ... ... . Starting around 1909 , Francis Sumner was able to produce different development of traits in originally identical Peromyscus mice that were reared under highly dissimilar conditions . He even thought for a while that he had showed a degree of inheritance of these acquired characteristics . However , he realized after a long while ( 1932 ) that his results were unltimately far more easily explained as a result of mendelian genetics . All this and much more were viewed as absolutely devastating to the Neo-Lamarckian cause , and the whole field was transformed and replaced by the advent of the neo-Darwinian synthesis , as Fisher and Wright and others demonstrated how natural selection was consistent with mendelian genetics , and how the Cold Spring Harbor work was so much more easily understood by reference to Mendelian genetics . However , the effort to demonstrate Lamarckianism by carefully designed and cleanly performed experiments set an extremely important and beneficial standard for experimental biology thereafter .
Perhaps it is just semantics here , but a place that tells a mythical tale rather than relating reality does n't have the right to call itself a museum . It is a theme park .

That is not necessarily true . I have known girls who have gotten pregnant and wanted an abortion but the fathers of the babies told them they did n't want them to have an abortion so the did n't and now the baby is healthy .
Laci Peterson 's pregnancy was far past the point of viability , so she would not have been able to get an abortion unless her health was in danger . Also , an abortion is a legal medical procedure , while cutting a fetus out of a woman with a knife is not . If I ran up to you and knocked you out and then performed some pseudo medical procedure on you , I 'd be arrested , regardless of whether or not you could get a legitimate version of that procedure on your own .
According to this , there are 1,531,764 crimes stopped by guns this year ( and it 's not even the end of the year yet ! ) . It also gives a reasonable explanation of why you do n't see this on the news every day . It also says that legal gun owners account for almost 0 % of all gun crime . So if you want to ban guns , 1,531,764 people will get killed or injured , and you 'll only take guns out of the hands of those who do n't even commit gun crimes .
Pure ignorance here , everybody take note . In Heller v. DC , in 2008 , the SCOTUS reinterpreted the 2nd amendment and invalidated DC gun laws .

So what . Congress can pass any law it wants . Does n't mean it will stand up in court . The first portion , `` A well regulated Militia , being necessary to the security of a free State , '' is a qualifier to what follows `` the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed . '' It seems pretty clear to me . But I 'm not one of the Justices . This decision has been made , although I do n't like it or agree with it . I do n't see where today 's hobbyist meets the intent - most especially in the well-regulated part . But there comes a point where what the dead guys thought just does n't matter that much . It is 200+ years later . They left us with the ability to adjust with time and we 've done that . They recognized their own shortcomings which might have the the wisest thing they did . The current interpretation is clear . We look at the last portion of the statement only . I do n't think that , as I said before , a little common sense , is going to alter the interpretation in any meaningful way . After all , I could easily argue ( if I was totally stupid ) that my front yard is the perfect place for a working cannon . We both know that is n't going to fly . Just where does the armament argument end . With a cannon ? Or with a Nuc . Let 's face it . They said arms and they meant arms . Not guns . They 'd probably let me have the cannon . The founding fathers never envisioned the kind of weapons we 'd have available today or what they 'd be used for . That 's why their thoughts are purposely criptic and open ended . Since we will always draw the line someplace , why not draw it at a good compromise between you and me .
Vermont legalizes gay marriage -- chicagotribune.com chicagotribune.com Vermont legalizes gay marriage The Associated Press 6:57 PM CDT , April 7 , 2009 MONTPELIER , Vt. -- The marriage proposal came not over a candlelit dinner or on a scenic mountaintop ; instead the couple were surrounded by a throng of gay rights supporters outside the Vermont House chamber . `` We have n't decided who 's going to propose to who yet , '' former lawmaker Robert Dostis said as he stood next to his longtime partner , Chuck Kletecka . `` But we 've been together 25 years in September , and I think September 14th would be a nice wedding day . '' `` Sounds good to me , '' Kletecka replied . `` I accept . '' The exchange came just after the Vermont House narrowly achieved the two-thirds majority necessary to overcome Republican Gov . Jim Douglas ' veto of a gay marriage bill . Vermont was the first state to give gay and lesbian couples legal recognition with its civil unions law in 2000 . It jumped to the lead again Tuesday : After courts in three other states had legalized gay marriage , Vermont became the first to have its Legislature do so on its own . Bills to allow same-sex marriage are currently before lawmakers in New Hampshire , Maine , New York and New Jersey . The three other states that allow same-sex marriage -- Connecticut , Massachusetts and Iowa -- moved to do so first through the courts , not their legislatures . `` For a popularly elected legislature to make this decision is a much more democratic process '' because lawmakers have to answer to the voters every other November , said Eric Davis , a retired Middlebury College political science professor . Courts typically deal with arcane points of constitutional law . While legislatures debate some of the same principles , the process may become much more personal . In Vermont , some of the most gripping debate came when gay lawmakers took to the House floor last Thursday and told their own love stories . Getting gay marriage approved in a political , rather than purely legal , forum is a big step , said Boston University law professor Linda McLain , an expert on family law and policy . `` What may give courage to other legislatures is that this legislature managed to do it , '' she said . She added that using the civil rights language of equality -- the measure in Vermont was dubbed the marriage equality bill -- could help make gay marriage more acceptable elsewhere . Opponents said they , too , believe activists will be emboldened in other states and could attack the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act , which defines marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman and provides that states need not recognize the marriage of a same-sex couple from another state . The Vermont action comes just days after the Iowa Supreme court ruled that not permitting gay marriage there was unconstitutional . `` To the millions of Americans who care about marriage , we say , 'Get ready . President Obama and Democrats will use Vermont as an excuse to overturn the bipartisan federal Defense of Marriage Act , ' '' said Brian Brown , executive director of the National Organization for Marriage , which waged a radio campaign against the measure . `` The next step is to ask the Supreme Court to impose gay marriage on all 50 states . '' To date , the same-sex marriage movement 's main gains have been in New England , which some attribute to Yankee liberalism and the gradual acceptance of gay relationships after Vermont 's groundbreaking civil unions law took effect in 2000 . Douglas had announced his intent to veto the gay marriage bill two weeks ago , saying he believed marriage should be limited to a man and a woman and calling the issue a distraction from more important economic and budgetary issues . In Tuesday 's vote , a yes was needed from two-thirds of those present to override the governor 's veto . The goal was easily achieved in the Senate , which voted 23-5 , but in the House the vote was much closer , 100-49 . The speaker 's announcement of the results to a packed Statehouse chamber set off whistles and cheers among supporters whose hopes had been temporarily dashed when the governor announced he would veto the measure if it passed the Legislature . Among the celebrants were Kletecka and Dostis , who recalled efforts to expand gay rights dating to an anti-discrimination law passed in 1992 . `` It 's been almost 20 years to get to this point , '' Dostis said . `` I think finally , most people in Vermont understand that we 're a couple like any other couple . We 're as good and as bad as any other group of people . '' Craig Bensen , a gay marriage opponent who had lobbied unsuccessfully for a nonbinding referendum on the question , said his side was outspent by supporters by 20-1 . `` The other side had a highly funded , extremely well-oiled machine with all the political leadership except the governor pushing to make this happen , '' he said . `` The fact that it came down to this tight a vote is really astounding . '' The measure had only 95 yes votes when it passed the House on Friday . But some changed their votes Tuesday . Rep. Jeff Young , D- St. Albans , who voted no twice because he 's philosophically opposed to gay marriage , joined most other Democrats in voting to override Douglas ' veto . `` I think if I wanted to continue my career here and have any chance of being effective , I had to vote with my caucus , '' he said . `` You have some pet projects , you think you can help your district back home with things that need to happen . I want to get a railroading bill through . I would n't even have had a chance to testify , let alone get it through . Now , people will listen to me . It 's the way the political game is played .

1 ) All organisms tend to produce more offspring than can possibly survive . False and that does n't invalide evolution given how it 's a misrepresentation of one of the statements in the theory .

Third , it is most tiresome to see all the horrors of the world ascribed to atheism when atheism has nothing to do with them . Atheism has nothing to do with the nationalism of the Nazis and Fascists , has nothing to do with the cult of personality established by various dictators and similar . And do n't even try to claim I do n't know any of it . I LIVE in the area you claim as `` Tito 's slaughterhouse '' . I KNOW what it was all about . And atheism did n't get even nearly close to the true causes .
Surely the theory of evolution can not predict whether a species is extinct or not !
Guns do make killing a relatively impersonal matter , do n't they ?
Show me comparable figures for the US , and include ALL violent crime rather than picking one isolated stat . I 'll take a slight increased risk of being attacked at home if it means a large drop in the risk of being gunned down in the street . Even if the claimed figures are correct , it represents a rate of less than 4 in 10 000 people every year . That 's one in every 50 people in the entire course of their lifetime . And that 's before we get on to what is considered violent crime . Pushing someone out the way while attempting to escape is a violent crime under UK law . Is that worth shooting someone over ? Despite the illustration of the article , I think you 'll find virtually none of the burglars was carrying a gun , and if any householders were killed it is a tiny number .
Today modern military assault weapons are M-16s and AK-47s . When the constitution was written modern was a musket . The next dictator that this country will see will also be using modern military weapons . The militia will need modern military weapns to fight for freedom . If that means nukes , then so be it .
That was the whole point of asking the questions , to prove evolution is n't an absolute truth

Since you brought up the questions , I wonder what your answer would be to that second question : `` Can one girl kill herself or do harmful things to her body if she chooses ... even against the other heads will ? '' Along those lines , do you support people 's rights to kill themselves ?
the former because it 's always a handy and ego-inflating explanation for disagreement and you do n't have any respect for other people 's intellect anyway ,

Then you freely admit that you lied when you said this , and I quote : People like Arch are setting it as opposed to science and in that position it will be doomed to fail . AND Arch is doing nothing but distorting the very thing he holds so dear , I mean , how is accurately quoting passages from the bible distorting it in any way ? You do nothing but post drivel which makes no factual statements at all . And you call that debating ? So , we are debating creation , yet you do n't consider quoting the bible , the single most important original proponent of the creation account and to you , it does n't qualify as a source for what is being discussed here ? You say this and expect to be taken seriously ? Really ? What book is that , because I have seen no quotes or links to any source of any info at all from you anywhere above on this page . So once again accipiter , what in the world are you referring to ? You and the obvious child oughta get along fine since you both offer nothing more substantial than personal attacks which are based on your own warped beliefs and corrupted interpretations of that which you disagree with . Here 's my original post again , I challenge you to explain how these alleged stone age sheep herders whom you scoff at and mock described contemporary living creatures which paleontologists today identify as dinosaurs , from skeletal remains ?
Walking-fish : The fact that I referred to social darwinism as a pseudoscience speaks for itself . Even though you speak against social darwinism , you still buy into the notion that it is an outgrowth of Darwin 's theory of natural selection .
Hi Lisa - I disagree with you . Babies ca n't be helped while trivializing and restricting mothers and not recognizing their needs . There are reasons women choose to abort and those need to be addressed and there will also be cases where women need to abort ( health concerns , rape , etc . ) .
The Bible only refers to `` high hills '' , and the mountains today wre formed only towards the end of , and after , the Flood by collision of the tectonic plates and the associated upthrusting .

That 's what bothers me so much about the pro-choice position on personhood regarding a fetus : there is an obvious double-standard . They seem to have no problem with the idea of it being a person when a murderer is convicted of two murders in case of killing a pregnant woman , but they refuse to allow for personhood with the fetus when it comes to the abortion issue . At least they could be consistent .
This is wrong . You yourself find `` mental existence '' to be `` sacred ' in a way . There is no rational argument for mental existence being the point of obtaining rights ... no matter how hard any of us try

I do n't think we have any , sorry . Our gun control advocates have surrendered , finding that their argument is so flawed that it is absolutely insupportable . Those who advocated less than lethal weapons have also been proven fools . Less than lethal weapons have been proven to be less than effective weapons . If you are in a situation where you have to use a weapon , you want a weapon that you KNOW will stop the bad guy , not a weapon that you think has a high probability of stopping the bad guy .
Ok I 'm put out , I just spent an hour replying to your original post bootfitter and somehow lost it . I 'll sum up . It seems that you would be willing to grant that and unborn baby has the same rights you have , if one could prove that the baby is 'human ' well I could go into the week by week day day thing of how the baby developes . Or I could just ask you . What do you consider to be the reason the baby is NOT human until birth ? or the third trimester or some other point
Waiting until they are born likely gives them no more chance of surviving than killing them in the womb . What chance does an unexpecting child have against a grown person intent on killing him ?
The government was right to tighten up the law governing the ownership of firearms after the 1996 Dunblane massacre . But Derrick Bird met the new criteria in the 1997 legislation and duly held licensed weapons . Comments by those who knew him centre around a common theme : it was totally unexpected . That nice , agreeable man simply flipped . But if the post-Dunblane legislation failed to prevent someone like Bird from holding firearms legally , then it is equally clear that it has had no effect on the supply and availability of illegal guns , including automatic rifles and other repeat-action weapons that are used routinely in gang activity in urban areas . Even if , as a result of Cumbria , the government were to make it virtually impossible for farmers and other rural folk to own guns , it would have no impact whatsoever on our efforts to tackle gun crime in urban areas . We would succeed in widening the divide between the two societies , but we would fail in keeping more of our young people alive . And we would only lend credence to those who suggest that the gang members who make guns their weapon of choice are simply congenitally prone to commit violent crime . The real killers in our society are those dealers in death who put illegal firearms in the hands of our young people .

True . My problem is that when someone , for instance Halton Arp , or Robert Gentry and others comes up with a well thought out arguement based on the evidence they are silenced because it goes against the main stream . Science is supposed to encourage challenge not suppress it .
Nope the simple concept of genes in a simpler era is dead . Its been dead a long time and the concept advances with our continued scientific progress . Such is the way of the world and it always has been . After all the original concept of gene was totally abstract and not linked to any molecular architecture at all . It was an element of inheritance and it still is !

The `` Big Bang '' theory is just a story that somebody made up ... there is no proof of it .
The theory of pangea ( One continent Earth ) fits the Biblical early Earth .
When Chicago passed a ban on handgun ownership in 1982 , it was part of a trend . Washington , D.C. , had done it in 1976 , and a few Chicago suburbs took up the cause in the following years . They all expected to reduce the number of guns and thus curtail bloodshed . District of Columbia Attorney General Linda Singer told The Washington Post in 2007 , `` It 's a pretty common-sense idea that the more guns there are around , the more gun violence you 'll have . '' Nadine Winters , a member of the Washington City Council in 1976 , said she assumed at the time that the policy `` would spread to other places . '' But the fad never really caught fire  even before last summer , when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the D.C. law and cast doubt on the others , including the Chicago ordinance before the court Tuesday . The Second Amendment may kill such restrictions , but in most places , it was n't needed to keep them from hatching in the first place . Maybe that 's because there were so many flaws in the basic idea . Or maybe it was because strict gun control makes even less sense at the municipal level than it does on a broader scale . At any rate , the policy turned out to be a comprehensive dud . In the years following its ban , Washington did not generate a decline in gun murders . In fact , the number of killings rose by 156 percent  at a time when murders nationally increased by just 32 percent . For a while , the city vied regularly for the title of murder capital of America . Chicago followed a similar course . In the decade after it outlawed handguns , murders jumped by 41 percent , compared with an 18 percent rise in the entire United States . One problem is that the bans did n't actually have any discernible effect on the availability of guns to people with felonious intent . As with drugs and hookers , when there is a demand for guns , there will always be a supply . Who places the highest value on owning a firearm ? Criminals . Who is least likely to fear being prosecuted for violating the law ? Criminals . Who is most likely to have access to illicit dealers ? You guessed it . If we were starting out in a country with zero guns , it might be possible to keep such weapons away from bad guys . But that 's not this country , which has more than 200 million firearms in private hands and a large , perpetual supply of legal handguns . Only a tiny percentage of those weapons has to be diverted to the underground trade for crooks to acquire all the firepower they need . While gun bans greatly impede the law-abiding , they pose only a trivial inconvenience to the lawless . This is especially true at the local level . Banning guns from one city makes about as much sense as banning them on one block . It 's hard enough to halt the flow of guns over international borders , where governments police traffic . It 's impossible to stop them from crossing municipal boundaries  which are unmonitored , undefended and practically invisible . Tens of thousands of cars enter Washington and Chicago each day from places where guns are easily and legally obtainable . Any of those vehicles could be transporting a carton of pistols to sell to willing thugs . If you 're on an island , you 're going to get splashed by the waves . The proponents obviously knew all along this city-by-city approach had serious shortcomings . But they figured it was bound to curtail gun availability somewhat . They also hoped that by prohibiting handguns in one place , they were beginning a bigger process . First , they expected that other cities and states would follow suit . Second , they wagered that strict controls at the local level would acclimate Americans to new regulations at the national level . But things did n't work out that way . The persistence of crime in supposedly gun-free zones did n't build support for broader gun control by showing the limits of piecemeal legislation . It weakened the case , by proving that such regulations have little impact on the people who present the biggest danger . Instead of a broad upward avenue , it was a dead end . Gun control supporters fear that if the Supreme Court invalidates local handgun bans , the consequences will be nothing but bad . That would be easier to believe if the laws had ever done any good .
If you ca n't see the difference between gay marriage and murder then you need your head examining . In a society based on the right to `` life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness '' what is the overriding need that means the rights of gays to the latter must be sacrificed .

Let me get this straight . We ca n't force a woman to give birth if she does n't want the child , but we can force the father to pay for the child 's care regardless of whether he wanted the child or not ? Interesting .
Obviously I am saying that we do not know whether it is a person or not `` morally , '' as you describe it . Yes , this does suggest a universal moral code .

: . . . One more thing & # 8212 ; one more thing I forgot to mention . One other thing we can do is to track the weapons that we have in Mexico . If we manage to detect weapons sold illegally in the United States in violation of this law on the control of weapons exports , or if , in the United States , they can have & # 8212 ; probably move forward on a good registry of armament or on the prohibition of certain massive sales of weapons , for example , to a hunter or to a common citizen & # 8212 ; we know that these people do not usually buy hundreds of rifles or assault weapons or grenades & # 8212 ; if we can move forward in those areas , I do believe that security both of the United States and Mexico will improve because those weapons are pointing against Mexican people and Mexican officials today .

Hello all . I am new here . I 've been lurking a bit and wondered why homosexuality is even an issue for heteros ?

What if you have a non-christian living here in America ( that would be me ) ... do you require them to live their lives the Christian way ? Please explain . Thanks , Ladywolf
The difference , and I think it is a significant difference , is that Omegamon spoke of feeling the threat of potential harm . I believe that understanding the risks that are faced every day does not require being fearful of those risks . Nor does it require being stupidly fearless . We all take reasonable steps to reduce our risk of danger every day . To me , the use of a firearm to reduce risk does not seem all that reasonable . The intent of my opening post was to find out why Omegamon and others feel differently .

Nothing other than natural selection which man has been aware of for thousands of years has been proven .
So the start of personhood for a particular person is a variable , based on that individuals memory . Twenty years ago I could remember events at my fourth birthday , but today those memories are gone . For a while I had personhood at 4 years of age , but today , looking back , I did not have personhood until I was 6 . As I age and my memory fails , it may turn out that I did not have personhood until I was 21 years old . Personnhood comes and goes . Do I have it right ? Not aware ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Not aware of what ? Shoot a gun behind them and they will flinch . They are aware of loud noises . Throw them wildly into the air and they will cry . They are aware of their own movement . Pinch them , they will cry . They are self aware as they chew on their toes . And of course puppies are aware as well . Unless of course I do not understand what you mean by aware .

One idea is that organisms are equipped with the flexibility to change their physical or other features during development to accommodate environmental changes , a phenomenon called phenotypic plasticity . The change typically does n't show up in the genes . For instance , in social bees , both the workers and guards have the same genomes but different genes get activated to give them distinct behaviors and appearances . Environmental factors , such as temperature and embryonic diet , prompt genetic activity that ends up casting one bee a worker and the other a guard . If beneficial , this flexibility could be passed on to offspring and so can lead to the evolution of new features in a species . `` This plasticity is heritable , and natural selection can favor different kinds of plasticity , depending on the range of environmental conditions the organism encounters , '' Pigliucci said .
Originally posted by Pie Hmm , just found this . Turns out that the theropod theory is n't as solid as it seems . If this is incorrect , and you can prove it ( this pertains primarily to Lurch ) try not to get your panties in a twist , okay ? There are a couple problems here : -There are supposed `` inherited similaritys '' in the forelimbs of birds and theropods . Both have a three-fingered `` hand '' , but embryological studies indicate that the `` hand '' of the bird consist of digits II-III-IV , but theropods have I-II-III . This is very contrary to the view that theropods evolved evolved into birds . ( Burke A.C. and Feduccia A. Developmental patterns and the identification of homologies in the avian hand . Science , 24 October 1997 , Volume 278 , 666-668 ) . -A second problem is the structure of the lungs . When studied , Sinosauropteryx revealed that in theropods , the thoracic cavity is seperate from the abdominal cavity near the diaphram . Birds have no such separation . There is no clear way that this could change without debilitating effects to the bird . ( Ruben J.A. , Jones T.D. , Geist N.R . and Hillenius W.J . Lung structure and ventilation in theropod dinosaurs and early birds . Science , 14 November 1997 , Volume 278 , 1267-1270 ) . -Finally , the hips are a trouble spot . While birds are `` bird hipped '' ( duh ) the theropod dinosaurs were `` lizard hipped '' . If evolution is true , then birds should have evolved from the ornithischian dinosaurs , whom were bird hipped .

Perhaps an analogy . Lets say for the sake of the argument you do not smoke or drink ( personally against it , for whatever reason ) . However , you believe others should have the right to drink and smoke if they so choose . So , you are personally against drinking and smoking but you are `` pro-choice '' in that regard ( meaning you believe every person should make that determination for themselves ) . Pro-life would be : You do n't drink and smoke ( morally against it perhaps ) and you are going to make sure that no one else is able to either .
there is nothing surprising about my being able to think for myself and reject the religion of evolution .
: It probably would have been better if Scalia had said to himself when the case was brought before the court , `` There certainly is no consensus about the meaning of the Second Amendment and I , as an amateur historian , am certainly not going to force my own personal views on others . I will let the people decide through their elected representatives how much gun control is necessary in their own communities . '' Nice interpretation by Dennis Henigan of HCI . He would have loved that but pretending it has n't been ruled as an individual right by the 82nd Congress , the DOJ in August 2004 with all the history and also by 35 Supreme Court rulings and TWO CENTURIES of lower court cases that fills a 660 pg . book with majority opinion , he is either deaf/blind or outright deceitful ... I opt for the latter . He and they know full well that all the courts now are bound to consider any Second Amendment case as a civil rights issue thanks to this ruling . `` letting people decide '' has already been done , once when the Constitution was ratified with the BOR and again when the XIVth Amendment was passed . He may as well say race issues will be decided by elected representatives the racial balance necessary in their own communities '' He is completely dishonest and knows full well that this is a Republic based on the Law of the Land , The Constitution and not a democracy as he suggests . One may as well follow the Piper over the cliff like a herd of lemmings to not recognize this time worn tune played by the gun grabbers .

I do n't have a large amount of interest in this topic and thus have n't heard alot of argument for or against it . I do n't have an opinion and stand no chance against those who know beyond infinite times more on this topic than I do . But regardless , I still have a question . Maybe I 'm wrong but , is n't lowering shootings a siginificant point in those who want to ban guns ? So they want to make the guns illegal and thus the only place they would be available is in the `` black market '' . Now we all know that guns in cases serve as a form of self protection from other people who would want to commit harm to the indiviusal . It is simply an average law abiding man who wants to have this pistol or handgun to protect him and or his family from those who would want to bring harm upon him family . The illegalization of these handguns would make it virtually impossible for those law abiding to get one of these guns in hopes of protecting his loved ones . I suppose a hope for those for the illegalization is that this would keep guns out of the hands of criminals . But that does n't make much sense . Making it against the law to own a gun is not going to stop the selling , posession and illegal use of them . Instead it only takes protection out of the hands of those who who only want to use it for `` good '' and does not do alot for those who would use it for `` evil '' . Like weed , making guns illegal would not lower the crime rate , but instead may very well increase those innocent dead because they were without protection .

This is a statement written by someone who obviously has not read scripture . One of the most astonising `` proofs '' if you will , that the Bible is of supernatural origin , is predictive prophecy . Science can not , as you claim , `` explain '' everything , and it has no natural explanation for the predictions made in scripture . How can science explain through statistical probablity the over 600 prophecies in Biblical writings that have come to pass ? Also , how can it explain how supposedly uneducated people ( uneducated in the ways of modern science ) wrote about astronomy as if they knew about the universe as we do today . How could they have described the hydrological cycle as we have only come to know it recently ?

Yes . I believe it 's a matter of personal individual freedom . If purchased legally , and not used to commit a crime , what harm comes from handgun ownership ? I do n't own one , but I own many other guns . If they can ban handguns , what 's to stop them from banning shotguns , or even BB guns ?

Upon Thee I was cast from birth ; Thou hast been my God from my mother 's womb . ( Psalms 22:9-10 ) For Thou didst form my inward parts ; Thou didst weave me in my mother 's womb . I will give thanks to Thee , for I am fearfully and wonderfully made ; Wonderful are Thy works , And my soul knows it very well . My frame was not hidden from Thee , When I was made in secret , And skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth . Thine eyes have seen my unformed substance ; And in Thy book they were all written , The days that were ordained for me , When as yet there was not one of them . ( Psalms 139:13-16 ) Thus says the LORD who made you And formed you from the womb , who will help you , `Do not fear , O Jacob My servant ; And you Jeshurun whom I have chosen . ( Isaiah 44:2 ) Thus says the LORD , your Redeemer , and the one who formed you from the womb , `` I , the LORD , am the maker of all things , Stretching out the heavens by Myself , And spreading out the earth all alone , ( Isaiah 44:24 )

It does n't matter if it 's 'earth shattering ' or not . By admitting that we hold different standards for the Bible proves my entire point : hypocrisy on the part of skeptics .

What the writing says is irrelevant to its authenticity !

I am more confused how Libertarian ideology can be used against abortion rights . However pro-life laws often lead to tyranny .

Well , I would agree that as many constitutional ammendments probably would not have passed , but I certainly do n't think they all would not have been passed , and I do n't think that Massachusettes allowing same-sex marriage was a bad thing . Constitutional ammendments are difficult to overcome , but no one can ever change a law if people are n't willing to take a stand and fight for it . Can you tell that I love the quote in Jyoshu 's signature ?
Fortunately , the Bolshevik Revolution failed . 1989 , the Berlin Wall came a-tumbling down , along with Soviet Ideology . Communism is a failed philosophy and the free world has soundly rejected it .
What a condescending attitude you have . In case you have n't noticed , you are a very small part of the human race that you smuggly hold in contempt . ( Thankfully small ! ) Your mission should be to improve it , not to stand back and claim you are better than everybody else , as you seem to do .

See the comments section on the blog entry I linked to , particuarly Stuart 's own comments ... `` Yes , you registered online , but the initial invitation was by invite only . You registered who was coming in your invited group , not just first come , first serve. There 's a lot of discussion there on that issue . But it really does n't matter -- a private screening of a film is a private screening -- they can boot anyone out that they want . I did n't say anything about anyone 'breaking the law . ' I 'm just showing you a different perspective of the events from a witness -- you know , giving you MORE information from which to draw conclusions . Or did you only WANT your information limited to one version of the story , mainly from the account of the one who got booted ? ? I think it was simply a private screening , and the people running the private screening did n't want them there . That 's their prerogative , as it was obviously a private screening and that 's the way it works . Again , read the comments on the blog I linked to as they include comments from people who were there , including more from Stuart and at least one by PZ Myers himself .
Not ALL of them ? ! ! ! Come on , Simone , it 's doctors like Tiller that slaughter thousands , not their typical adversary .
You sure can . A mass murder of at least 13 children was committed with a knife . That has happened before even in Japan as well as other countries including here . No conclusion to be drawn . It happened , it is history and now a well known fact .
I 'm really not so sure about Obama 's healthcare plan , when I read it it seems kind of wishy-washy ... # like what does `` Reform the insurance market to increase competition by taking on anticompetitive activity that drives up prices without improving quality of care . '' actually mean ? # In practice ? # I 'm more interested in the Health Care for America plan more , it & # 8217 ; s a proposal put together by the political scientist Jacob Hacker with the support of the Economic Policy Institute . I & # 8217 ; d suggest reading Thinking Big to get a better idea of the plan , but the basic idea is that employers pay money into a public fund , enough to cover their workers. # The public fund should have quality coverage for all , including preventive care. # Workers get to choose - keep your insurance , choose a different private plan , or join a public health insurance plan without a private insurer middleman , pick your healthcare providers and doctors. # Employers choose too . Those who prefer not to shoulder the burden of providing coverage as good as the law requires can decide to enroll their workers in the public plan at a modest cost. # HCFA and Medicare would function as a single nationwide insurance pool covering close to half the population . So basically either the public plan attracts most Americans , and our system gradually evolves into single-payer or because the floor prevents a race to the bottom , the public-private competition raises the bar on care and efficiency , improving quality and cutting costs , even in the private insurance plans. # The standards would be kept by a strong government watchdog. # What do you think ?
How can something come out of nothing ? It seems that before that first thing that existed something had to exist before that .
No , because 2+2= 4 if you agree with it or not . Its a concept that is not dependent on man to agree with it .
If I was to ask a religious person of a provable way that he found out about his belief he would have to say that he was told . If the person that told him was asked the same thing he would have to say the same answer . Now of course it can go back wards like that for ever , it has to go back to three possible beginnings : some one lied , some one was insane/delusional/ect , or there was divine intervention/ect .
A lab in Washington State was able to mineralize wood in matter of days , not the millions of years scientist claim it takes to occur . Not to mention a new onslaught of YEC 's saying , 'See , I told you so . '' I bet Kent Hovind is folding this information into a new presentation as we speak .
For those that think the title is justified , what about the two beliefs do you find similar enough to class them as the same idea ?
how is disproving the best explanation scientists can come up with for the diversity of life without divine intervention not an argument for divine intervention ?
Actually , the title is a little deceptive , however I have noticed that one verse in his new song `` Runaway Love '' , one of the verses brings up something relevant on the abortion debate . Verse 3 goes of the song , I noticed goes : `` Little Erica is eleven years old She 's steady trying to figure why the world is so cold So she pops x to get rid of all the pain 'Cause she 's having sex with a boy who 's sixteen Emotions run deep and she thinks she 's in love So there 's no protection he 's using no glove Never thinking 'bout the consequences of her actions Living for today and not tomorrow 's satisfaction The days go by and her belly gets big The father bails out he ai n't ready for a kid Knowing her mama will blow it all outta proportion Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion Erica is stuck up in the world on her own Forced to think that hell is a place called home Nothing else to do but get her clothes and pack She say she 's about to run away and never come back . '' I know its not completely relevant to the abortion issue , but it is very relevant to the lives of little girls living in poverty and being abused . I would like to know what your opinion of the verse is .
Okay . Most botanist are evolutionist but facts are often confusing to evolutionist .
Materialists : believe that lifeforms are evolving upwards from something ugly ( bacteria , fungues , etc ) by way of a purely physical mechanism ( no thought or intelligence required )
I don & # 8217 ; t know why you are having such a hard time making sense of my quotes .
Of course , by that logic , we ca n't prove that the laws of physics exist even though we observe them all the time . The same applies to the existance of other stars , the theory that bacteria and viruses cause disease , and , of course , the existance of a god . Not only that , but you ca n't be sure that you are even on 4forums debating ; you might be drugged or in a VR machine . no , my logic has nothing to do with the above paragraph .
No , it does n't . Not the mistaken view you have given , anyway . If you look in the literature for signal transduction or transcription control , you see that your mistaken view of the Razor is completely discarded .

what do you have against abortions ? Assuming you can not simply get off by saying the Bible says this or religion says that , what else can you say ? The fact is that abortion does not affect you .
In fact , it is in contrast to generally accepted biological rules ( life does NOT come from nonliving matter ) .
or bs .
Sorry , but you ca n't have your cake and eat it too -- you ca n't separate issues regarding homosexuality from religion questions as far as many people are concerned . You do n't get to simplify a complex issue so easily . Homosexual issues ca n't be adequately discussed outside a context that includes religion .
`` The gun lobby , however , didnt count on an uprising among African-Americans in Congress who favor gun control .
All those things would just ask for trouble just as putting up the no guns sign could . There is no benefit to them . I do n't know how this seems logical to you that people should be willing to put up these signs if they do n't have a gun . I 'm sure you would n't put up a sign saying you were not home or put up a sign detailing your computer 's IP address and its security system or lack thereof . It takes about one ounce of intelligence to realize that it would be stupid to do this . However , you can have no gun in the house and use the same signs that Kelvin mentioned . This is no different than a person putting up a sign showing what security system is protecting there home even if they do n't have a security system . It is the poor mans security system . So since we are on the topic of using signs to encourage or discourage violence , would n't you agree you can play on criminal 's fear of guns without actually owning a gun ? I would say that you can .
We explained to you ( more than once ) that federal law ( which says otherwise ) always trumps local law .
Good , then you go back to the first point , which is that you can not rationally claim to have knowledge of the unknowable . So yes , you 're back to either being rational and not accepting god , or being irrational and accepting knowledge of the unknowable . I do n't make the rules Jim .

Because if you are I 'm sorry someone else will have to do this . '' This idea that someone 's political and/or ideological view on a public referendum issue should have any bearing on whether he should be allowed to do other things is scary , if you ask me . It 's stepping into the realm of thought-police fascism .
The reason his sentiments confirm the worst fears of creationists is n't because Lewontin alone has those sentiments , it 's because creationists can clearly see those sentiments in the NY Times editorial board , CNN , ABC , Dan Rather , Handgun Control , The Sierra Club - the list is almost endless .

What makes you think doctors are paid badly in a national healthcare system ? GP salaries in the UK average GBP100 000 , that 's US $ 200 000 , around 4 times the median income in this country .

Not to rain on anyone 's parade : `` The liberal hysteria about the tea parties and town hall protests , kicked off by the Obama administration & # 8217 ; s issuance of a Homeland Security bulletin warning of right wing terrorists and extremists , has led to a lot of hyperbole on the left about how , well , extreme and terrorist-like the right is becoming . And to be sure , there are some nuts who are politically active on the right who should probably be locked up for their own good . But there are plenty of nuts like that on the left as well .
What 's your definition of pure ? Has it ? This says different : http : //skepdic.com/homeo.html I do know of recent studies that show that minute amounts of toxic substances are beneficial and therapeutic .

If someone comes up with something that works can they just call it homeopathic medicine and say that homeopathic medicine works ?
Like I said , Catholic school . Or it could be that you 're like 80 years old or something , because nowadays , if you talk about God or the Bible , then you do n't get in trouble , you get criticized and made-fun-of , not only by your peers , but also by teachers .

The bottom line : Evolution can not be disproved as it has already been proven . Creation can not be disproved except in regard to errant conclusions related to the timing of events . Evolution is the method that God used to create all things .

On this 35th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision , I would like to share my views on the issue of abortion . Life begins at the point of conception . No one can deny that after a human being is conceived it will develop into the very same being as those debating this issue . What astounds me is that those who favor abortion went through an identical development stage as the being they are condemning to death . Would these very same people agree that a similiar choice should have been made about their own existence ? Abortion today is used primarily as a birth control of convenience because people are too self-centered to take precautions . They prefer their own pleasurable self-indulgence over the care and sanctity of the life they created . What ever happened to taking responsibility for one 's actions in this country ? Is it too much to ask a woman who has conceived to place the child into adoption ? Nine months of discomfort is nothing compared to life in prison for voluntary manslaughter ! Does the father of the child have a say in this ? And what about the constitution of the United States ? Are not all people conceived in this country deserving of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness ? I believe abortion is a crime against humanity and should be outlawed . We need to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision and get back to cherishing life in this country . For a country that murders it 's children can not be far from self destruction .

First off , the comet impact which killed off the dinosaurs was millions of years before the ice age that humans lived through . There was nothing vaugely human around at the time . Secondly , there 's a growing body of evidence to indicate that dinosaurs may have been warm blooded as well . It was n't the cold per se that killed off everything , it was the fact that plants died off , disrupting the food chain . Anything that required alot of food , and anything human sized would have been included , was in trouble . As for the original question , it seems that even creationist have given up on persuing this line of inquiry . If creationists think something is too far fetched to consider , then you know it 's really out there .
It says had formed because the narrative is in the past tense . However , the preceding line says `` I will '' implying he had not made them as of that point .
Otherwise you would not so vehemently and tenaciously defend that metaphysic against any suggerstionthatits take on reality , its ontology/cosmoly , is incorrect -- even when , as in the case of EAM , that suggestion comes from a metaphysical quarter that has no ideological connection to any religious mythology , and in fact is also antithetical to those myths .
You say , `` The universe and earth are very old . We know this as a fact . '' What is meant by `` old '' ?
Studies of the origin of the first life form , of the origin of the earth , and the origin of the universe itself do not form part of the theory of evolution . Such studies are pursued within different scientific disciplines .
Very interesting , and I agree with you . However , one thing to consider while debating pro-lifers is that they generally do not care about women 's rights .
note : religion should not influence your decision in law making . only in personal moral decisions .
I saw Bowling for Columbine . It was excellent . It showed how many Americans have this idea that problems are solved with violence . That 's the way that problems are often dealt with domestically and overseas . That 's why America drops so many bombs on people in foreign nations and kills them . They interviewed some Canadians in the film and the Canadians says that they like to negotiate and work things out . That 's the way they solve problems- not through violence and killing people . I think this is very relevant to the gun culture in America . Those in the gun culture tend to have the attitude that problems can be solved with violence- thus the necessity of owning an instrument of death and destruction . I remember that Michael Moore went into the house of one gun owner and the gun owner showed him the loaded gun that he slept with under his pillow . I think that 's dangerous and totally stupid to sleep with a gun under your pillow . The film also examined famous people from the gun culture like Terry Nichols and Timothy McVeigh . Moore also accomplished some good things . He went to K-mart with some victims of Columbine and convinced K-mart to stop selling handgun ammunition .

Offspring vary among themselves , and are not carbon copies of an immutable type . Stop the Press ! Evolutionists often just glide over this very important point . Indeed , each creature in a population is not a carbon copy of the next ... .HOWEVER ... the notion that these differences can spell the difference between who breeds and who does n't is in huge error . Humans , for instance vary widely in appearance ... but does that mean that some of us will be genetically less likely to breed ? That makes no sense .

A women by the name of Mary Anne Warren said this The fact that restricting access to abortion has tragic side effects does not , in itself , show that the restrictions are unjustified , since murder is wrong regardless of the consequences of prohibiting it ; and the appeal to the right to control one 's body , which is generally construed as a property right , is at best a rather feeble arguement for the permissibility of abortion . Mere ownership does not give me the right to kill innocent people whom I find on my property , and indeed I am apt to be held responsible if such people injure themselves while on my property . It is equally unclear that I have any moral right to expel an innocent person from my property when I know that doing so will result in his death . What are you thoughts ? Is this just some pro-life nut that does n't know what she is talking about ?

From the article : `` A majority of registered Californian voters ... '' `` ... a growing number of Californians ... '' `` The poll of 1,052 registered Californian voters ...

The Gun Control Act of 1968 , which initiated the background check requirement , was written by liberal politicians ; the main people who support gun control laws . It was these same gun control nuts that chose to intentionally not require private transfers to involve background checks . You missed the opportunity back in 1968 , you have no room to gripe about it now . Shut up .
And on the `` taking to task '' issue , did you ever see the `` gay forum '' that was held for the presidential candidates ? Months ago when there were handfuls on both sides . The televised forum that ALL the Republicans refused to show up for . They WERE quizzed on gay marriage , and asked to justify their positions . It 's old ground .
As I understand , the Second Amendment was written as a protection against political tyranny . The Founding Fathers knew that the King of England had used a standing army to oppress the people in the past . The solution was a well regulated militia and to not limit arms ownership to those in the military . However , because of big advances in military technology it 's difficult to see how the kinds of arms typically owned by modern American gun owners would be very effective against the type of arms used by those in the armed forces . What use would a handgun be against a tank or F-16 Fighter plane ? I think a lot of people are uncomfortable dealing with this issue so they choose to focus a lot on personal self defense against criminals instead of what the Second Amendment is mainly or solely about . We saw this in the recent Supreme Court decision . They chose to focus a lot on the role handguns could play in defending house and home against criminals , but seemed to have no problem with a ban on machine guns- the kind of guns that would logically seem to be most protected by the Second Amendment because of their usefulness in military conflicts which would make them a better deterrent against tyranny than other types of firearms . Thus , the Supreme Court chose to `` strain at a gnat and swallow a camel '' to use a Biblical idiom in their treatment of the Second Amendment .
The problem with ID is that there is no evidence , and it is simply not possible to falsify it . If we were able to prove that our dating procedures were false and that really we stood on 2 legs back when the Earth was created and that the fossil record is not really as we thought it was , evolution would be falsified . Intelligent design can simply not be falsified because there is no supporting evidence for it . That is the line between religion and science .

Hmm , a peaceful world , largely , without the desolation of war . What an interesting proposition . Alas , it seems that Jesus did not come into the world to bring peace .

There is of course a more insidious uses of science .

You liked to David Icke - the guy who beleives that Giant Lizards are secretly running the world today ... you need to take this with a pinch of salt . Anyway , I honestly do n't really see a problem with salvaging things from the dead that are going to benefit the rest of mankind . It sounds icky , and is to a degree but seems better than feeding them to maggots or just burning them . Fair enough if you want have it as an option like Organ Donors but seems the same thing really to me , especially as there are babies that die because they need immediate organ or tissue donors after being born . Its the allegations of babies being killed to fund this I doubt , seems to be an attempt to sensationalise a piece of news . I stand by the original point that there is n't really a medical use for fetus skin as was claimed , some of the organs might be of more use but thats about it .

The zygote is the cell formed when the sperm fertilises the egg . The zygote has no brain , it has no conciousness . You have two tables , one with a small test tube which you know holds a microscopically small living zygote , and another table with a live baby . You are told that one of them will be destroyed and you have just two seconds to decide which , or both will be destroyed . Without a seconds thought I would immediately point in the direction of the zygote , and save the life of the baby . Extreme pro-lifers on the otherhand would probably end up killing the baby or both via indecision and inability to make a choice in just 2 seconds . That 's the morality of pro-life for you : the inability to realise that the chemical reactions that happen when a sperm meets an egg do not define a human person . Am I wrong ? I do n't believe so . The sperm meeting the egg is a really random point to decide the emergance of a human person . Why pick that point specifically ?
What amazes me is someone could actually believe a constitutional ban on gay marriage is in anyway a contributing factor to divorce rates .

Then there is n't a systematic way to look for these things , so any telescope time he applies for would be taken up by random searching , which is probably why someone else gets the telescope time .
Yes , common sense proves that is true .

Then why does n't He answer prayers like He says He will in the Bible ? So is Jesus , aka God , a liar ? Or was not even one of the millions of believers who prayed for Terri Schiavo 's life to be saved really God 's child ? Gee , I wonder how many people out there are being led by a pastor , priest , or what have you , that prayed but God did n't listen because that religious leader is a fraud ? Hmmm , maybe the or molestation of young boys , y , and so on , by religious leaders is more widespread than anyone could have imagined ? ! ? ! ? !

It is interesting to note that confidence in the system has improved as the debate over health care reform has moved to center stage .
Logical truths simply follow from the way in which concepts are defined . 1 + 1 = 2 is true and always true because of the meaning of ( 1 ) , the + sign , and = . They are not dependent on matter , nor are they dependent on god . It is true regardless of whether there is any matter which the number 1 can be used to describe , or regardless of whether any conscious being exists which can think it . These are not concepts created by man , but discovered by him .

The vast majority of proclamations and assumptions illustrating a cultural gap between science and Christianity , such as this post , are over emphasized and exaggerated as they focus on people who are expected to be out of touch ( ie . People educated in the 40 's and 50 's when higher education was less common ) or a very small percentage of Christians . Christians included in mass people of all academic backgrounds who find their paradigm consistent with their viewable ( and non-observable ) reality and by alienating them in mass by focusing on the minority of Christians you perpetuate falsehoods .
A very small fraction of our genetic material -- about 2 % -- performs the crucial task scientists once thought was the sole purpose of the genome : to serve as a blueprint for the production of proteins , the molecules that make cells work and sustain life . This 2 % of human DNA is converted into intermediary molecules called RNAs , which in turn carry instructions within cells for protein manufacture . `` And what of the other 98 % of the genome ? It has been assumed by many to be genetic junk , a massive accumulation of code that evolution has rendered superfluous . Now , however , scientists are discovering that the vast bulk of the DNA in our genomes , while it does not code for the specific RNA molecules that serve as templates for protein synthesis , do nevertheless perform various kinds of work .

Africa is not universally hot and arid . Surely you are n't ignorant of that ... The Pygmies are found in Rainforest which is characteristicly hot and humid . Hutus are not a race unto themselves , they are part of the Bantu group which is found chiefly across the Eastern side of the continent which is drier and less forested . This group emerged relatively recently but has been successful in displacing older groups such as the Pygmies and Bush men into less hospitable areas when they came into contact .
Firstly handguns held by criminals are illegal in UK so the fact that homicides have increased is irrelevant to the handgun ban . One could argue that without the handgun ban the accidental death rate would have increased . Personally believe that the UK handgun ban was too much hysterical overreaction but there . Secondly the ownership or not of handguns has no known connection to the increase of any crime whether in Uk , Australia or USA . Thirdly the ownership of guns in Switzerland relates to their military service requirements as Israel . Fourthly Not sure what doctors have to do with this anyway unless you wish to confie stats to gunshot wounds or the occasions when a doctor shoots their patient !
Also , I think that evolution in itself is sort of a religion , as it tries to explain the creation of the universe and of all life .

It seems the wars are repetitious and always involve a tyrant and his government and other wan na be 's like Vichy in France capitulating with Hitler . Most of the Free Army was composed of whom ? When did the resistance begin and are you making the argument that `` resistance is futile '' or that resistance is effective ? No doubt Sarge will have some insight on the sitop also ?
I find that very interesting that many Christians are so loudly against abortion , yet their own bible condones it .
Again , this is evidence only to suggest not prove . I can not prove nor can anyone else . However , to say that there is no evidence even to suggest it is way beyond the realm of logic .
If someone says the big bang people have to say the big bang and not the `` evolution of the universe '' because it will just waste time .
To re-iterate - the police face mandatory training and testing , continuous psychological and physical assessment and a character check before they even enter the force .

Hi SS . Causing trouble again ? The cat experiment you describe can not , unfortunately , be used to support Lamarckian inheritance , because all the animals were denied the same essential nutrients , both the parents and the developing cats in the womb . Logically , if lack of nourishment causes health problems in one generation it 's inevitably going to cause the same problems in the next even without any evolution taking place . As others have pointed out , this experiment is evidence that adaptation to that restricted diet was not happening . Had the cats initially suffered and then begun to get better , this would be strong evidence that adaptation was occurring . Similarly , if you were denied Vitamin C you would develop scurvy . If a pregnant woman was denied Vitamin C - well , it hardly bears thinking about , but the fact the baby - were it to survive at all - would undoubtedly also suffer from scurvy is readily explicable by the observation that it , too , was denied Vitamin C. Now , if the baby was born with a functional Vitamin C synthesising gene , that would be compelling evidence that organisms could intelligently respond to environmental changes .

Anti-abortion . Here 's why . Nobody can tell us with any certainty when a person becomes a person . Science ca n't , religion ca n't , and politicians certainly ca n't . Since an abortion has real potential to kill a person it should be illegal for the same reason dropping a brick from the roof of a building is illegal or speeding is illegal or firing a gun randomly in your house is illegal . Many of the laws in this country were formed to make it illegal to do things that might harm/ kill another person . When a inteligent person fires a gun for instance : he makes sure of his target , makes sure there is nobody in front of or behind his target , checks his backstop , etc . In other words the shooter takes precautions to insure that nobody will be harmed . Those types of precautions can not be taken in the case of abortion . I would ammend this with an exception for when a pregnancy to term would result in a previously unknown risk to the mother . Side bar : the terms pro-life and pro-choice annoy me to no end . I find them to be misleading and disingenuous . When debating you are either for a subject or against it , pro-abortion or anti-abortion . Happy Halloween
You 're the expert on that feeling ... ..
You have fallen into the same trap as the IDers . When we say `` designed '' there is an unspoken prepositional phrase -- `` by an intelligent entity '' . What is really meant by `` designed '' -- in both Paley and IDers -- is that plants and animals are manufactured . Just like the watch was manufactured .
The family is the foundation of any society . A healthy family is the product of a healthy marriage . Not all marriages are healthy , but help is out there for them too . Anyone can choose to go to counseling and choose to pray to God , and HE will most certainly heal lives and marriages . A country is only as strong as its foundation . Our country is great because of its strong moral foundation . Look at the countries that have collapsed after continually turning their backs on God - the evidence is right there ! The government HAS GOT TO PROTECT MARRIAGE , because if it doesnt , this country will crumble ! If we listen to anyone on this issue , we should listen to FORMER HOMOSEXUALS ! They will tell you for themselves how sick they were , and now have found release from the chains of bondage ! they now have healthy relationships with the opposite sex . If they were supposed to be gay , and `` born with it '' ... .then why are they so much happier and `` free '' now after saying goodbye to homosexuality ?
Sharron Angle may be giving the press the silent treatment now , but she has n't always been so tight-lipped . Think Progress ( via Alternet ) has dug up some eyebrow-raising audio of a radio interview the Nevada Senate candidate did with Bill Manders back in January . The subject : abortion . Her stance : disgusting . Manders asks her whether there is `` any reason at all for an abortion , '' and she answers : `` Not in my book . '' For clarity , he says : `` So , in other words , rape and incest would not be something ? '' And Angle replies with this reasoning : `` You know , I 'm a Christian , and I believe that God has a plan and a purpose for each one of our lives and that he can intercede in all kinds of situations and we need to have a little faith in many things . '' You see , God planned your rape and pregnancy . Is n't that reassuring ?

As shown above , our definitions were essentially the same .
`` Am I prepared to be a mother ? `` , who gets to answer it ? Is it the role of the State or of the Church to tell her what the answer to that question is ?
`` There 'll be cheering for our results on the pro-life side and denouncing us angrily on the pro-choice side , Neither of those positions is sound . ''
First of all , I am against abortion in nearly every circumstance , to save the mother 's life and rape or incest being the situations I deem it allowable . That said , the anti-abortion people where I live are beginning to get on my last nerve . Every week , they pick out an intersection and hold up gigantic graphic posters , close up bloody pics of aborted babies converted into 6 ft. X 3 ft. posters . Everyone who drives down the street gets these images forced upon them , adults and children , and I just ca n't agree with this tactic . Often when I am stuck at a red light one of the whackos will yell something my way ( little does he or she know my stance on the issue ) and I will generally yell something back like `` Get a f-kin job ya freek ! '' Stuff like that . They have now taken to knocking on vehicle windows at stop lights , attempting to pass out pamphlets - even though that is illegal by city ordinance . Standing on the roadside holding signs and distracting drivers apparently is not . Two days ago I saw the largest intersection protest I have witnessed . There must have been fifty to one hundred protesters holding the giant posters . Part of the reason it happens so often where I live is because we have an abortion clinic that serves most of northern Illinois outside of the Chicago area . The mis-named Northern Illinois Women 's Center is in fact an abortion mill located in a former school ( of all things ) . So that tends to rile folks up . That the owner of the building decided to name the building `` Fort Turner '' and put a large sign out in front ( Turner being the former name of the school ) did n't help matters . Bringing in a tanker truck with manure and threatening to hose down the protestors - now that was funny . Once , a Catholic priest rammed his car into the building to gain access then got out of the vehicle and started chopping the place up with an axe , until he was arrested . Needless to say , the abortion `` clinic '' has been a flashpoint in the community since it was opened at least 20 years ago . Now there are always protestor 's walking with signs in front of the abortion mill , and I can certainly understand that . IMHO that is where they SHOULD be protesting . But , I am becoming more and more perturbed with the people forcing these disgusting giant photo 's on the public in general at public street intersections . Does this sort of random street protest happen elsewhere ? ? ?
like i said , i am not exactly a scientist so i just wanted to clear something up that confuses me . it is a scientific law that `` matter can neither be created nor destroyed '' correct ? but doesnt this contradict what you said about particles appearing and disappearing ?

... Wow . You think creationism has hard things to explain ? Not near as hard as evolutionism . But I 'd love to hear the attempts .
And no country in the developed world has such a system . Take your strawman elsewhere . In any case , if such decisions are made I 'd rather have them made by democratically accountable government than private corporations . I live in a country with a very good , though not perfect , public healthcare system , and the system proposed in the US is not government run , by any stretch of the imagination . The government will not own the hospitals , employ the medical staff , pay for most of the medicine , that will all be done by private insurers and private hospitals still . My maybe vote therefore means I think the US system needs to be nationalised , it 's much more efficient to do that .
Yet another false assessment . Why is posting Christian historical context `` anti-Christian '' ?
As I see it the problem in this country is not guns . The problem is that our society has gotten soft on crime and pretty much gotten to the point of `` no one is responsible for their own behavior '' . Take the law suits against the gun manufacturer 's . Colt comes to mind . Someone used a Colt firearm in a murder and the victim 's family sued Colt for the wrongful death of a family member . The court 's basically said that colt should have known that their products may have been used in a crime and not sold them to someone who could have used it in the commision of a crime . That being the case , why ca n't the auto manufacturer 's be sued when one of their vehicles is used in the commision of a crime ? Why ca n't Ford or Chevy be sued when one of their vehicles is used in a DUI vehicular homicide ? The reasoning I have read is that the auto maker 's are unable to control the end use of their products . So how can one manufacturer be held responsible for the end use of their product and not another ? Another case in point . Less than a hundred years ago , if you were convicted of a murder you were sentenced to death and the sentence was carried out . Now if you murder somebody , you can plea bargain it down to involuntary manslaughter , get sentenced to 18 to 23 months , and be paroled in 9 to 12 month 's on good behavior . Now some would say the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment . To them I put this question . What do you call kidnapping a child from her bedroom , raping and sodomizing her , putting her on a hot engine block , then strangling her . Do n't know about the rest of society , but that qualifies as cruel and unusual punishment in my book . By the way , the guy that did this was sentenced to life in prison on the taxpayer 's dime . No longer does the punishment fit the crime in this country . We have put a price tag on human life and I must say it is a damn cheap one . Guns are not the problem in this country . The problem is a government who trying to erode our rights to further their own agenda . Now for those who say we have a police force to protect us , if you would actually read their purpose , you would see that the police force has no duty to protect the individual , only the public in general . I have quite a few friends at the local state police barracks and in general they are opposed to gun control . Most police organization who are for gun control who are for gun control are politically motivated . For those who are going to say I 'm a right wing nut job , I 'll give you this . I served my country in various special operations forces . I can not go into anymore more detail than i 'll give you here , so please do n't ask . Automatic weapons were designed for assualt purposes so I will give you that one . However , as a highly decorated combat veteran I will say this . The most dangerous and demoralizing weapon ever made was a sniper rifle . Death can come from anywhere at anytime . Most have an effective range well over any automatic weapon . Sniper rifles are basically modified hunting rifles that can be duplicated by any gunsmith worth his salt . The effective range on a 5.56mm round ( basically a .223 remington ) fired from an M-16 ( or An AR-15 ) is just over 450 meters . A 7.62 x 54 mm round ( a .308 , a very popular hunting round ) is about 1200 meters . To put this in perspective there is just over 1700 meters in a mile . I do carry a M1911 Colt .45 as a concealed carry weapon . After reading some of the other posts here , I must say I am deeply offended by someone saying that because I carry a CCW I 'm going to shoot someone over a fender bender . I will say that their are some who should n't be carrying a CCW . And I do take responsibilty for my weapons . Unfortunately . I have had to use my weapon on a couple of occasions . Most of the time simply brandishing the weapon and taking control of the situation is enough to end it in a positive way . Only once have I had to discharge my weapon in self defense . By the way , the criminal in on the receiving end of that one had a very long and violent criminal history . I have shed the same blood in the same mud as alot of others to insure that EVERYONE in this country has the freedom to have their own opinions about things . That is a right guarenteed in The Constitution of the United States . Just as it is a right for me to own arms of my choice . Some would say that my RKBA is outdated . To them I ask , what if I think your right to free speech or freedom to religion is outdated ? Should it be changed too ? There are no easy solutions to the problem we as a society are facing . But blaming guns or free speech for our problems is like saying flies cause garbage . It is easy to blame guns for our problems . But they are merely a tool , like a shovel , that unless put into use by a person or persons . it merely just sits there and does nothing . Our society has pushed the issue of not being responsible or held accoutable for your actions way to far . I do have a solution to these problems , but most would find it offensive . What the hell , I 've probably offended alot already , so here goes . We have a three time loser law , that if you have three felony convictions you are considered a career criminal . Now alot of those crimes involve firearms . So if you are convicted of three felony firearms crimes , you should get the death penalty to be carried out immediately . It will take some time to get the message across but iI do believe when the message gets out , firearms crimes will be reduced drastically . Well , I need to get some things done so I 'll write more later . Later all ... ...
Pro choicers claim they are for the rights of women . If that is true why do n't pro-choicer want the pregnant women who seek abortion to be informed . I read yesterday , how the pro-choice people are trying to block legislation that would help women make better CHOICES about their pregnancy . If I find the link , I 'll post it , but the legislation was anyone who seeks an abortion , must have access to a sonogram before the abortion . That having an abortion `` may '' cause post-abortion stress syndrome , which for some it does ! It 's sad , pro-choicer , do n't want women to be `` informed '' to the best of their ability . Sonogram can be helpful tool to the WOMAN in helping her make a better CHOICE , and are n't pro-choicers all about CHOICE . So why block this legislation ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? I do n't understand why pro-choicers have so much hate .

You mean where the judge did the job she 's paid to do by ruling on the constitutionality of a law ? Or is this only a problem when it 's laws that you like that are ruled unconstitutional ? This is Civics 101 . If the legislature writes a law that is unconstitutional , it 's the job of the judicial branch to strike it down . The legislature can then rewrite the law , or get the constitution amended . I 've yet to see you demonstrate this process being abused in the matter of gay marriage . All you 've done is point out rulings you do n't like .

That 's really simplified . It 's not like a woman 's body is a suitcase and the fetus is biologically self-reliant . It lives off her life processes - her blood , her immune system , her calories - it puts stress on her joints , muscles , heart , and bladder . Pregnacy can demand major sacrifices in behavior and diet - some of which can be detrimental . No a baby is n't the woman 's body - but a pregnancy IS .
Making abortion illegal goes against common sense ? I would say that making abortion legal in call cases makes no sense ... but ok. You also maintain that only religious people are against abortion ... I know this is n't true because many of my friends or family are not religious and are against abortion . Not only that , there is an organiztion called lp4life ( libertarians ) and many of them are not religious and they argue against abortion on non-religious grounds which is what many of us do here on the forum . Stop making baseless claims because you have a quarrel with religion . Your unwanted children claim is also baseless . There has already been a debate on this and it is very clear ( as he does n't respond anymore ) that abandoned babies will not increase due to abortion being illegal . Another baseless claim . I do n't understand why you just make claims and then never back them up eventhough you say you use logic and common sense . Is it logical to oppose abortion only because you are mad at a religion ?

It 's more of a confirmation of Rapid Adaptation rather than Natural Selection imo . It 's very similar to the Finches who , in a very few generations changed their beak lengths in response to the changing environmental conditions . Natural Selection implies minute changes over millions of years leading to new species . Not noticeable changes in just a few , or even 10 generations to guarantee the survival of a creature .

The European Union -- an area with a population approximately 25 % higher than that of the U.S. -- reported fewer than 1,300 firearm homicides for the same year . In Japan , the number was 22. sinjin - The US firearm homicide rate is more than 180x that of Japan .
Think about the following questions for a while : Why do we have an inbuilt sense of right and wrong ?
you do n't ... you break open the `` rock '' and carbon date the soft , flexible parts that somehow survived for 100 million years without turning to stone . ( It would also help if you broke the big bones open and looked for such tissue ... something science evidently never has done either until Mary S. did it a couple years ago .
Me personally ill go with what i see , not what i hear or read . And as far as gun laws and gun control goes , or any laws for that matter , do you honestly believe if guns were banned that criminals wont be able to get them anymore .
Termites produce two times the carbon dioxide that humans do ... let 's have a war with termites to get rid of some carbon dioxide . lol
But to atheists , telling the truth is neither right nor wrong , i.e . they have no basis for morality .
i can not prove 100 % that God exist , the atheist can not prove100 % that God does not exist because absolute proof is not posible .
Note this paragraph in the classical oath and its implication for doctors performing abortion and euthanasia : `` I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody who asked for it , nor will I make a suggestion to this effect . Similarly I will not give to a woman an abortive remedy . In purity and holiness I will guard my life and my art . ''
I would secondly say that saying that one has a constitutional right to marry is not the same thing as saying that one has the right to marry a person of the same gender .
( edited for brevity ) Abortion is the greatest moral evil of our time . Dr. James Dobson .
I find it interesting that the slippery slope fallacy keeps popping up again and again in the arguments of pro-gun activists even after the Heller decision . In that decision , the Supreme Court recognized an individual right to own guns but rejected the slippery slope argument that has been used by the gun lobby for years .

As long as abortion is legal , men can be denied the right to procreate ! If `` choice '' is to be applied fairly , men should be allowed nine months after learning of the pregnency to legally `` abort '' their relationship with the child . Otherwize , men are left with fewer `` rights '' and additional responsibilities ( for which he can be arrested if he does n't meet them ) . However , it would be much easier to consider intercourse the only time when any `` choice '' can be made .
but , thats not the point .
But it is n't , because of immigration , so what 's the problem ? Besides , our population should decrease . Either that , or people should consume far less . After all , in terms of environmental impact , you can fit twenty times as many Chinese or South Asian people as you can one American in a population .
Creationists have a theory . Evolutionists do n't know .
When was the last mass murder at a UK university then ?
Hey pandion , voting according to the rules of the California Constitution is not imposing any individuals will or morality on anyone .
Carmen , it 's senseless not to believe that Abortion is Planned Parenthood 's # 1 reccomendation . Does Planned Parenthood offer pregnancy support ? No . Do they offer ultrasounds ? No . Do they have maternity wards ? No . What do they do ? They give out pregnancy tests and do abortions . That 's where they get their money- a quarter of all their revenue is from pre 13-week abortions . This is not even countig their later more expensive abortons that are also so common ! They get $ 40 million a year for abortions alone .
`` It 's not helping . The guns these people have , they do n't register , they do n't care , they 're probably stolen , they 're probably obtained illegally , in many cases they 're prohibited , '' commented Chief Hanson . sinjin - What 's with the probably ( s ) ? Have they attempted to trace handguns recovered from criminals ? Wonder how many trace right back to the US ?
Is murder still illegal in your humanistic world ?
Just curious what the Poll results here on this forum will be . 1 ) Yes , I want the Bill to pass - as is . 2 ) No , I do n't want any kind of government-run , mandatory health care 3 ) Maybe , if it is tweeked
i 'm going to be a teacher because i love history and thats what i want to do . so why should i be punished for it ? why should i have to live in poverty for working just as hard as a billionare . i should be able to work hard at something and make a REAL contribution to society without being poor .
And in November the democrats will lose full control of the house and senate , and all of these obamanations will be undone one after another . The American people strongly opposed health care reform and spoke out loudly against it , and they were soundly ignored . No democrat is safe come November . They lost in 1994 , they 'll lose in 2010 again ... and this time it might take decades for them to regain any measure of control . Yes change is coming , the right kind of change . The change from liberal socialists to conservatives who will undo what went wrong .
These cells can not be anything or produce anything other than what they are ... in other words includes only the information to reproduce itself , ergo ... human skin DNA can not morph into liver DNA , so no fish forming legs , no apes flying planes or creating `` higher order '' intelligence .
Yet the very seat of Catholicism glorifies one of the absolute WORST offenders Explain .
I ca n't think of any good reason to qualify the delivery of healthcare other than need for a physician . Where one lives or does n't live , makes no difference , and neither does the fact that a person has broken the law . Health care is a civil and human right in a democratic society .
It is horribly oppressive of women , though , to oppose both abortion and contraceptives . That means that women will have no control over their pregnancies at all .
Lack of a Natural Mechanism . Charles Darwin , in his Origin of Species , proposed Natural Selection to be the mechanism by which an original simple-celled organism could have evolved gradually into all species observed today , both plant and animal . Darwin defines evolution as `` descent with modification . '' However , Natural Selection is known to be a conservative process , not a means of developing complexity from simplicity . Later , with our increased understanding of genetics , it was thought perhaps Natural Selection in conjunction with genetic mutation allowed for the development of all species from a common ancestor . However , this is theoretical and controversial , since `` beneficial '' mutations have yet to be observed . In fact , scientists have only observed harmful , `` downward '' mutations thus far . Time Constraints . Both Creationists and Evolutionists agree that if evolution is at all possible , there needs to be an excessive ( if not infinite ) amount of time . For much of the 20th century , it was thought evolutionists had all the time they needed . If the earth ever looked too young for certain evolutionary developments to have occurred , the age was pushed back in the textbooks . In 1905 , the earth was declared to be two billion years old . By 1970 , the earth was determined to be 3.5 billion years old , and by the 1990 's , the earth had become 4.6 billion years old . However , Young Earth advocates have identified quite a few Young Earth chronometers in recent years . Currently , there are approximately five times more natural chronometers indicating a `` Young Earth '' than an `` Old Earth . '' Each discovery is a separate `` Limiting Factor '' that places a constraint on the possible age of the earth . For example , moon drift , earth rotation speed , magnetic field decay , erosion rates , chemical influx into the oceans , ocean salinity , etc , all constrain the possible age of the earth . Each Limiting Factor is distinct . If one were successfully challenged , there is still the problem of all the rest . Furthermore , there are Limiting Factors constraining the possible age of the universe , such as spiral galaxies where they 're maintaining their spiral shapes despite their centers spinning faster than their extremities .
Voting on fundamental rights like marriage is fundamentally flawed in that it puts the rights of the minority up for the prejudice of the majority .

Reading the opinions in McDonald v. Chicago , you might think it was as much a civil-rights case as a gun case . In the ruling , the Supreme Court decided 54 that the Second Amendment applies to states and localities , not just the federal government , and struck down Chicagos handgun ban . The four conservative justices , along with Justice Anthony Kennedy , formed the majority . One of the conservatives , Clarence Thomas , also filed a concurring opinion . The main disagreement betwee the two opinions concerned whether the Fourteenth Amendments privileges or immunities clause or its due process clause is the best way for the Court to apply constitutional protections to state and local governments . But in the process of making their arguments , both opinions emphasize the racial history of the Fourteenth Amendment  the story of the postCivil War South and the federal governments crusade to ensure fair treatment for blacks therein . The heart of the problem was that , in an effort to stave off rebellion and maintain the racial caste structure that had developed under slavery , state and local governments refused to respect freedmens constitutional rights . Crucial to the Souths efforts were gun-control laws that applied to blacks and blacks alone . This does not show that modern gun controllers are racist , or even that the modern gun-control movement has racist roots ,  as some have suggested  the concerns that motivate Sarah Brady are neither the same as nor descended from the concerns that motivated racist southern governments . But this does show that when a government has the ability to forbid gun ownership , it has the ability to render groups it dislikes helpless to defend themselves . Regardless of whether modern gun control accomplishes its purpose of reducing crime  and for the record , there is no evidence it does  a free society should fear a government with such power . The Souths campaign against black gun ownership , not surprisingly , began long before the Civil War . Two slave rebellions in the 1820s stoked whites fears , and in response , many legislatures amended their laws prohibiting slaves from carrying firearms to apply the prohibition to free blacks as well ,  Thomas notes . Georgia forbade blacks to own , use , or carry fire arms of any description whatever. Florida empowered patrol [ s ]  of white citizens to search negro houses or other suspected places , for fire arms ; blacks caught with guns  whether slave or free  were brought to the nearest justice of the peace for whipping on the bare back , not exceeding thirty-nine lashes. ( They could escape punishment by providing a plain and satisfactory explanation . ) It wasnt just blacks , but also anti-slavery whites , whom governments tried to disarm . For example , during the Bleeding Kansas period  a series of violent skirmishes in the 1850s between pro- and anti-slavery elements in that future border state  there were attempts to take guns from the free-soilers. As the majority opinion in McDonald notes , the 1856 Republican-party platform described this as a violation of the right to keep and bear arms . When the war ended , fear of rebellion peaked , and southern governments ramped up their efforts . Some states passed laws banning black gun ownership or gun carrying , and there was a systematic effort to disarm the freedmen who had served in the Union army and then returned to their homes in the South . Roving bands of exConfederate soldiers , many affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan , took arms from blacks by force while official law enforcement looked the other way . In South Carolina , a group of black citizens wrote the following to Congress : We ask that , inasmuch as the Constitution of the United States explicitly declares that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed . . . that the late efforts of the Legislature of this State to pass an act to deprive us [ of ] arms be forbidden , as a plain violation of the Constitution. The problem wasnt just that the laws were discriminatory , forbidding blacks but not whites to own guns  it was that the government had the right to ban gun ownership by the law-abiding at all . Even if the South had banned all gun ownership , disarmed blacks would have had to deal with the armed and racist state militia and state peace officers ,  the justices note . They might have added that , without technically discriminating by race , the South could have used the techniques it later employed to keep blacks from voting  grandfather clauses , literacy tests , etc .  to exempt whites from facially non-discriminatory gun bans . ( We see a modern analogue to these policies in laws that prevent the poor from owning guns . It costs $ 340 , nonrefundable , just to apply for a gun permit in New York City , and the rich and famous seem to have a lower likelihood of being rejected . Also , the gun-control movement periodically goes after Saturday-night specials  that is , handguns cheap enough that the poor can afford them . ) It was gun-control laws  along with other laws that violated virtually every right blacks had  that led to the Fourteenth Amendment , which authorized the federal government to ensure that state and local governments respected citizens rights . The Freedmens Bureau Act of 1866 , passed just two years before the amendment was approved , made it clear that the right to keep and bear arms was an important right for freed blacks to have : The right . . . to have full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings concerning personal liberty , personal security , and the acquisition , enjoyment , and disposition of estate , real and personal , including the constitutional right to bear arms , shall be secured to and enjoyed by all the citizens . . . without respect to race or color , or previous condition of slavery. Advocates of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 cited the disarmament of freed blacks as a reason the law was necessary . These laws , however , didnt work . Southern governments refused to enforce them , and the Supreme Court  which was far less powerful then than it is today , anyhow  did not intervene . To drive the point home that the South had to respect blacks rights , including the right to bear arms , Republicans in Congress passed the Fourteenth Amendment ( they had the numbers to do this because they had refused to seat the Democrats the South had elected , many of whom were former Confederate soldiers ) , sent it to the states for ratification , put the former Confederate states under martial law via the Reconstruction Acts , and made their ratifying the amendment a condition of ending military rule . The Supreme Courts decision gives Americans a lot to think about  from the privileges or immunities clause to the Courts proper role in enforcing the Constitution . But whenever we discuss gun control , we need to remember that a government capable of gun control is capable of tyranny . Both the majority opinion and Thomass concurrence in McDonald  following in the steps of works such as Stephen P. Halbrooks Securing Civil Rights  perform the crucial service of explaining how important that fact was in the wake of the Civil War .
And all having a real , verifiable negative impact on society , which can not be said about gay marriage . Can we tone down the drama a little bit ?
So , you have no problem with the fact that this is abortion and was caused by god ?
So you claim not to know what my sources are ( why else would I have to provide them for you ? ) , but also claim to know that half of them are from blogs ? Not only are you logically inconsistant , you 're also wrong . I 'm talking about my four surveys from PubMed , the ones that yuou repeatedly tried to claim were from the UK wheras in fact they were all from the US . Remember ? Just for you , I 'll find them again . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . Various quotes - Guns are used to threaten and intimidate far more often than they are used in self defense . Most self reported self defense gun uses may well be illegal and against the interests of society . we find that criminal gun use is far more common than self-defense gun use . This result is consistent with findings from other private surveys and the National Crime Victimization Surveys Firearm self-defense is rare compared with gun crimes . A minority of home invasion crimes result in injury . Measures that increase the difficulty of forced entry or enhance the likelihood of detection could be useful to prevent these crimes . Although firearms are often kept in the home for protection , they are rarely used for this purpose . For full text of each report , just click the PubMed 'full text ' button on each page and follow links to PDFs .
Actually its not sickening in any way . These kids are at risk and need to know the resources available to them to avoid realizing those risks . Frankly I thinik its a good idea to trot them around to agencies and organizations which they may need to interact with in the future . Knowledge can keep them out of deep trouble . Ignorance will not do so .
as they to Have the wrong hands
Cone brought up a good point to me one time . He said that pro-choicers are scared of making abortion go on the ballot and scared of people knowing the truth .
My contention is this : since joining the forums , Chuz has posted ( 1 ) pro-life arguments based on the ( 2 ) initial assumption of `` the fact that a human individuals life biologically begins at conception '' .
That is not true you can believe in both . You can not believe in both if you believe in the literalness of the bible .
I also think it is noteworthy that the pro-life movement is really making a difference , if anything to hit the polls in elections and send the message that we are tired of a cheap view of life in this nation --
They only need 1/4 of the legislature , so they 'll probably get that . But if it actually gets to the polls ? The conservatives took a big hit when they ran around screaming `` If gays get married society will collapse and we 'll all be doomed ! ! ! 11 ! 1 ! ! '' and then nothing happened . And of course the most organized group in Mass . opposing gay marriage is the Mass . Catholic church , and people are n't going to take kindly to a bunch of child rapers telling them what 's right and wrong . The anti-gay side really does n't have much to work with ; it 'll largely be a contest of good will and common sense vs. scare tactics , and the scare tactics have already been proven wrong .
You talk about the Fourteenth Amendment and again claim that gun control is racist . If gun control is truly racist then it 's a wonder that the courts in areas with strict gun control laws have n't been flooded with claims of violations of the Fourteenth Amendment 's equal protection clause . Funny how only a few people on an online message board have managed to figure this out .
Since posts are disappearing anyway , let me add a new one . Now we all know that I am made in the image and likeness of God and since God is perfect , that image and likeness must also be , as a logical consequence , perfect . To state less would mean that God is not perfect . So if I am the image and likeness of God , then either I am perfect or God is not .
the laws of logic are non-material , universal , unchanging , and absolute
The empire you defend is tyrannical . They are responsible for the death of millions .
That has nothing to do with acknowledging or not acknowledging facts .

Your stats are n't broken down into meaningful groups , so nothing is learned WRT Muslims .
I should n't know , its never happened to me .
Interesting insight on the matter , foundit . I find it strange that no anti-gay marriage proponent has responded yet .
That you can not differentiate between ignorance and an unwillingness to be sucked into a battle of the facts against your cherrypicked denialism is no surprise . Mr Gore 's commentary is not germane to serious debate . While he is far more credible than Ben Stein , he is no more a climatologist than you are .
So if everyone had a sign on them and a water pistol then would you be happier or does everyone need to have a gun ? Should everyone who has a gun have a sign as well ? Is the deterrent of a gun diminished without the sign ?
But now we get to the actual definition of science . To me at least , science is how knowledge is acquired , different possibilities , and objectively examining these possibilities as well as publishing them to the public for scrutiny . So basically science is the answer to the question of why or how . Why is it that when an apple is dropped , it goes towards the Earth ? How fast does it go ? When I drop it does it really speed up as it goes along ? These are all matters of science , so basically almost everything in the world can be considered science , which is why I believe philosophy is considered a branch of science .
How did you come to that conclusion ?
Wonderful mumbo-jumbo I 'll agree . If that is the way you wish to order the events of evolution ( the process by which everything was formed ) then what exploded in the big bang ?
In short , I think this analogy needs to be reconsidered because of one important fact : a person who is brain-dead will never recover from that state no matter how much medical treatment is given , whereas an embryo who is `` brain-dead '' most certainly will fully recover from that state in a relatively short amount of time if left alone .

We 're off to quite a start , yes . When we `` extrapolate from the relativity intensities from the particular cells '' , we may have left the scientific world and entered the philosophical world . When we `` extrapolate '' , dictionary.com tells us that we ; `` infer ( an unknown ) from something that is known ; conjecture . '' and a conjecture is ; the formation or expression of an opinion or theory without sufficient evidence for proof . I 'm now slightly less confused about why I 've never seen this discussed before .
The difference in traits has nothing to do with mutations or new genes ... it has to do with gene expression ... ..
So how would you make a study that shows the benefits of gun ownership ? I don´t think there is any way to do this .
Oh well . At least from my studying it seems that the Christian worldview is not correct in any way , shape or form . But still , if anyone wants to convince me , please do .
ABC aired a special on the effectiveness of CCW on campus . They had a student take a concealed weapons class ( who had never fired a gun before ) . After the class , they put him in a classroom with 20 or so people dressed in protective gear and face shields . They armed him with a simunition pistol ( a pistol that fires non-lethal rubber projectiles used for training ) . In the middle of a simulated college `` instruction period '' , a police SWAT team member charged in and started shooting . This was to conduct an `` experiment '' to see if students carrying concealed weapons was an effective means of stopping a mass killer . Guess what happened ? When the `` shooter '' busted into the classroom , the armed `` student '' immediately went for his gun , got it tangled in his shirt tail , and was shot with a simunition round . The conclusion reached by ABC and `` proven '' was that CCW was ineffective in a mass shooting scenario . DUH ! ! ! What a surprise ! A complete novice with only three hours of basic firearms experience was instantly killed by the TRAINED POLICE OFFICER WITH 15 YEARS EXPERIENCE AS A SWAT TEAM MEMBER ! Yup . Having an experienced CCW holder who is familiar with modes of carry , clearing concealment garments during presentation , basic defensive firing positions , and has practiced extensively with his firearm go against an emotionally imbalanced , drug or alcohol affected , common shooter is n't a real test . You have to put a young , inexperienced , trainee with THREE WHOLE HOURS of firearms familiarity up against a DECORATED SWAT TEAM MEMBER . This is considered `` scientific proof '' that CCW is no good by ABC .
You will have to look at the big picture to understand my point .
or join the real world and become a free thinker . but do n't try to tell us evolution is wrong or has holes . its propsterious .
Abortion today is used primarily as a birth control of convenience because people are too self-centered to take precautions .
Ephraim is smitten , their root is dried up , they shall bear no fruit : yea , though they bring forth , YET I SLAY EVEN THE BELOVED FRUIT OF THEIR WOMB

Show me just ONE person anywhere who will admit that the environment working on individuals can give the illusion of populational adaptation or even long-term evolution . Show me one person who admits that a simple environmentally-induced phenotype could mislead paleontologists who dig up fossils .
This is what evolutionists believe to make a long story short ( and tell me if this is real science ) : nothing + nothing = two elements + time = 92 natural elements + time = all physical laws and a completely structured universe of galaxies , systems , stars , planets , and moons orbiting in perfect balance and order !
Up to now , still billions of people in the world believe in his lies ! !
Teaching students to be responsible !
I 'm pro-choice , but to say that having an abortion should not or will not effect EITHER parent is callous . You 'll , most likely , ( at minimum ) wonder regretfully what could have been . Choice in abortion is n't a small choice , like whether to wear a blue or black suit ( and should n't be ) . Nonetheless , it is and should be a tough choice that only the woman who must carry the child can make .
Just a word of advice . If you stopped doing all those stupid things with font size and color some people , me included , might give your posts more serious consideration . If you need to be `` clever '' in your presentation to get your point across then your point ca n't be all that well formulated .
this is my favorite one- 2e . Human beings should not be discriminated against because of their place of residence .
I did n't like that phrase `` evolution is all that is '' , but made an assumption as to your intent ( I 'm assuming that `` evolution has operated to create the diversity of species without the intervention or guidence of a creator '' and I voted accordingly .
But you can not prove a negative . Which is also why you wo n't be able to prove that creationism is wrong , and why we ca n't prove evolution is wrong .
To quote Scott Adams : WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU ! ! ! ! ? ? ?
What did we have when we first took the dogs to the environment ? Dogs ( varying in hair sizes ) . What did we get after a short amount of time ? Dogs ( only the long hair size ) . There is no evolution occuring here , we had dogs before , dogs after .

What a broad reaching generalization you have made . Since you are in the habit of naming logical fallacies , you should like this ... You are committing the fallacy of hasty generalization as well as the fallacy of using an unrepresentative sample . This is very disturbing for one who seems to have a handle on his logical fallacies . But kudos must be given out to you as you have managed to commit two fallacies in one sentence .

Care to post a link ? Because I googled `` Vitter admits to adultery '' and came up with zero results about this story . And can you show where he is a fundamentalist christian and not just a conservative Republican ? And I find it very hypocritical how frenzied your side can become at his admitted personal sin when in regards to your own personal values system adultery is n't considered sinning at all . If he admitted to sodomy , would you also make an issue of that which you consider totally normal activity ? And ca n't you see the hypocricy and double standard by throwing such stones in the face of seeking acceptance of your lifestyle ? If I were to put myself in your place , would n't it have made more sense to attempt to justify his actions as a non issue in order to show that we are all alike and criticizing any sexual standards of right and wrong is damaging to the human condition ? Again , I ask , where is the consistency in your thinking ?

But the training material does not have the honesty to inform docents about these resources . For example , the Guides resource list includes the National Academy of Sciences Teaching about Evolution and the Nature of Science ( 1998 ) , but it does not include any creation books , such as Dr. Jonathan Sarfatis Refuting Evolution , which ably demolished the bad logic of the book .

There is no reason to perpetuate these harms . I have heard many arguments opposed to same-sex marriage , but there is not even one of them that justifies these harms . In fact , I would even say that there is not one argument against same-sex marriage that makes logical sense at all . Thus , even if same-sex marriage brought no benefits , there would be no reason to keep it illegal ; a free and equal society does not deny rights or benefits to anyone , unless it has a very good reason to . And there just is n't any reason to deny rights and benefits to same-sex couples .
I happen to be a theology and philosophy major .
I do n't suppose any evolutionist have realized that all the evidence for evolution is also evidence for ID . They often talk about the mountains of irrefutable evidence , but the fact that the sun rose and set every day was evidence for the sun orbiting the earth , but it 's also evidence for the earth spinning . Likewise all the evidence for evolution can be condensed into one statement `` life forms are similar to other life forms '' , This is predicted by the intelligent design hypothesis as well . Direct evidence for ID that would not support evolution would be irreducibly complex biology , direct evidence for evolution that would not support ID would be more than just adaptation , it would have to be original useful DNA , or a simulation showing that coherent structure can be achieved without intelligent design by randomization and elimination .
Of course , we also need to note that the rise and fall of abortion rates are not necessarily linked to who is president at the time .
All they are really pressing for is basically for kids parents to tell their kids AT HOME that god guided evolution without it contrasting directly with what the kids are being taught at school . Personally , I see no problem with this , as long as they stick to the facts in any case . Just glanmcing over the proposed changes , I am not seeing anything that is factually incorrect .
Regarding the stars , I have a thought . We measure the distance of stars in light years , then try to predict their age . Perhaps when measuring the distance , that 's all we get is distance- not actual `` time '' , or age . If this were true it would explain the difference between the `` old '' and `` new '' earth theory .
why the comparison of gun owners yo violent killers and serial rapists ? What law have I broken ? Since we are doing comparisons your anti-freedom agenda is very similar to the bazi gun control laws of the 1930s , it is like the jim crow laws of the US . Your agenda is one of racism . This is insulting , ignorant , and shows your true colors as an enemy of freedom .
It is rather disrespectful but do n't think it is limited to one side . Most protestors on both sides are n't great .
I would call a fossil that had both reptillian and avian features a strange creature that God created at the beginning of time .
They have no imagination or sense of reason that allows them to create as we do so easily . After millions of years of so called evolution they are still monkeys and science is impressed that they have learned to use a stick to reach into an ant hill . What they ignore is that they learned to do that a thousand generations ago . Nothing new since then though where as Humanity has built up the World and conquered the Air , Sea and Space in that time .
Oh .
On the bright side , at least you 're right about being an unfit parent . I recommend that after you have done away with your current child that you avoid reproducing in the future .

It has been shown that life expectancy of such offspring diminishes by 10 years . This is because of the large number of genetic mistakes that happen within the genome  which essentially ages the individual .
Brooklyn , New York ( VBS.TV ) -- On January 22 , 2006 , the New York Times reported that all foreign journalists were being banned from Pakistan 's tribal areas , which has been called `` the most dangerous place in the world . '' A week before that , the CIA fired missiles remotely from a Predator aircraft into the Waziristan tribal area . They were hoping to eradicate a bunch of al Qaeda operatives . Instead , they killed 18 women and children . One week before that , I arrived in Pakistan to visit Darra Adamkhel , the massive open-air market located deep in the tribal areas , where a frighteningly high percentage of Islamic holy warriors goes to buy their guns . Gaining access to the tribal areas was next to impossible . It took months of pre-planning with the consul general of Pakistan in Montreal and top officials in Peshawar . They repeatedly denied us entry because , according to them , the Pakistani Army had too many `` sensitive operations '' going on in that region . Without my personal advantage ( a family friendship with the governor of the Northwest Frontier Province ) , we never would have gotten in . The government assigned me and my team a political agent named Naeem Afridi . He was born and raised in the tribal areas . He took care of us while we were there , and he was a godsend . You ca n't do anything in this part of the world without someone like Naeem . Our driver stopped at a security point just outside the town center , where we were introduced to the Frontier Agency militia , six angry-dad-looking guys with AKs and sidearms . They became our personal bodyguards , and followed us through the tight warren of gun shops and factories , barren little brick rooms where upward of 1,000 guns are manufactured every day . Most of the work is done by hand . The vendors are Pashtuns , who are basically the toughest people in the world . They comprised the majority of the mujahideen who kicked the Soviets out of Afghanistan in the late '80s . These days , the town is rumored to be completely overrun by the Taliban . They purchase the guns , then cross the border to fight the U.S. army in Afghanistan , or they drive through the mountains to the south to fight the Pakistani army . This summer , I went back to Pakistan , and found that the fuse on this powder keg has become even shorter . The Pakistani army has surged more troops into the tribal areas , attempting to eradicate the Taliban and al Qaeda . The U.S. and British troops are attempting to do the same thing on the other side of the border in Afghanistan . Meanwhile , Pakistan itself has seen violence spread to its major urban centers , where extremists have been detonating bombs and taking over police stations . But at the same time , there is a cultural explosion taking place , a vibrant art scene and metal and rock bands popping up everywhere . The whole situation has become ultra charged by the fact that there are tons of news channels operating uncensored by the insanely corrupt government . For Pakistan , it 's a volatile , turbulent , and fascinating moment in time .
This is so inane I dont know where to start . Firstly - If there existed an armed forces capable of destroying the US military , then an armed civilian population would be absolutely no barrier to them . Secondly - There is no single nation on earth that can move 200,000,000 men . Thirdly - How exactly do you propose China get its men to the USA ? Are they going to use their secrect commie teleporting machines ? There is no chance for them to cross the oceans , or deploy either north or south of the USA .

PENNSYLVANIA CONSTITUTION Section 21 . Right to Bear Arms The right of the citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State shall not be questioned . I do n't see the word `` qualified '' in there .
Evidence ?
SCHUMER : OK. Now , let me ask you this . When you wrote that statement , you did not -- as we discussed yesterday -- when you wrote that the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion , you had no exceptions . So that would mean , at least in 1985 , your view then , there would be no constitutional protection for a woman to terminate her pregnancy even if the termination was needed to preserve her future ability to have children , right ? ALITO : Senator , it was a general statement that did n't go into -- it did n't ... SCHUMER : But it had no exceptions . You did n't make that ... ALITO : It was one sentence , and it certainly did n't represent ... SCHUMER : There was no -- you did n't write any exception for that situation . Correct ? It just said the Constitution does not protect . It was without exception . And , yesterday , you did n't argue me when I mentioned that without exception . ALITO : I do n't recall your using the words without exception . SCHUMER : I think I did . ( CROSSTALK ) SCHUMER : If you believe ... ALITO : Could I just answer that question ? It 's one sentence and it certainly is not an attempt to set out a comprehensive view of the subject . SCHUMER : No , I understand that . But it was a very strong statement . It did n't talk about any exceptions at all . And the way I read that statement , even if a woman was raped by her father , she 'd have no constitutional protection to have an abortion and terminate that pregnancy . If you believe the Constitution protects no right to an abortion that would follow , would n't it ? ALITO : I think the statement speaks for itself , and it 's one sentence and it 's not an effort to set out a comprehensive view of ... SCHUMER : Knowing these examples , do you still refuse to distance yourself in any way from a broad , unqualified statement , without exception , that the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion ? No ands , ifs or buts , is my words . ALITO : What I actually said was that I was proud of my participation in the Thornburg case in which the government made the argument that it made in the Thornburg case ... SCHUMER : But you said in the previous sentence to that statement that you personally held those views . ALITO : That 's correct . But what I was talking about there was the Thornburg case and nothing more than the Thornburg case . SCHUMER : I understand . But you have n't rethought the position at all , even knowing these extreme cases and the hardship that it might cause ? ALITO : Well , what you have pointed out is exactly why , if the issue were to come up , and one were to get beyond stare decisis , the whole judicial decision-making process would have to be gone through . SCHUMER : You did n't think that through in 1985 ? ALITO : I was not involved in ... SCHUMER : When you wrote the statement . When you wrote that statement . ALITO : And when I wrote the statement what I was saying was that I was proud of what I had done in relation to the Thornburg case , which was to write the memo that the committee is aware of , which did not argue that Roe should be overruled , did not argue that the government should argue that Roe should be overruled , but that the decision should be challenged on other grounds that were quite similar . SCHUMER : I understand what you wrote , but you also -- we can bring the statement up here , but I do n't want to go over the thing of yesterday . I would just ask you to think of all the consequences of a broad statement , even from 1985 , that the Constitution does not protect the right to abortions . Not an exception of health of the mother , not an exception of rape or incest , not an exception of any of these others . I did n't see any of those in your job application . But I want to conclude on ... ALITO : Senator ... SCHUMER : Go ahead , please . ALITO : It was one sentence . And I think what you 're saying highlights the importance of not addressing this until the judicial process takes place where all of this complexity would be taken into account . SCHUMER : In all due respect , sir , I think it highlights the importance of an obligation to discuss it , particularly in light of a strong statement before . But we 'll have to differ on that .

Evolutionists have constructed the Geologic Column in order to illustrate the supposed progression of `` primitive '' life forms to `` more complex '' systems we observe today . Yet , since only a small percentage of the earths surface obeys even a portion of the geologic column , the claim of their having taken place to form a period of rock -- life -- time over the earth is therefore fantastic and imaginative thinking .
So I think this magical answer for the `` gaps '' in evolution theory deserves a name . I choose to call the god of time and chance The Almighty IT ! It has all the answers . In the beginning there was it ! And IT said -let there be hopeful monsters and there were hopeful monsters and IT saw that it was good . And that began and ended an undetermined amount of geologic time .
they believe they themselves are the only god of their body .

Over the years these educated people through the media as journalist and movie/television writers began sharing their preliminary understanding of evolution as indisputable fact .

Miller continues ; Evolution is not any of those things . It really is about science , and this means that the question of evolution is fundamentally different from issues of social and moral values . His mistake here , is that evolution is n't any of those social moral things because it should n't be . Yet he clearly shows , from Lewontin 's words , that it IS .
The `` truth '' about atheism is that it 's the only proposition that makes sense ( apart from agnosticism ? ) to people who conclude , as I do , that religious principles are not based on reason . I know it 's a bit unusual in a public forum but I 'd like to introduce a little personal history here by way of illustration of my path to atheism : I was educated during my most impressionable years ( 11-18 ) at a grammar school controlled by the Jesuits . All my teachers were priests and many were of formidable intellect . Every morning began with `` divine service '' , every lesson was started and ended with a prayer . At noon we sang the Angelus and at 3.30 in the afternoon we finished the school day with Benediction . We had at least one session a day learning and reciting the catechism - so we could be word perfect in our answers to metaphysical questions . Yet all this religious conditioning failed to arouse any spark of faith in me . Sure , I conformed to all outward appearances , but inwardly I rebelled and I did not believe . So why did n't I believe - because my clergymen teachers gave me no REASONS to do so . When , eventually , during my last days at school I chose to reveal my disbelief - the Rector said , `` Well , after all , faith is a gift from God ! '' , and I had received no such gift . Since , in my view , there is no reasoned evidence for God 's existence , why succumb to wish-fulfillment ? It 's less comforting but more honest to be an atheist .

To sacrifice the life of a mother in that situation to the life of a fertilized egg , an embryo , a fetus , is a heinous , anti-life crime . To demand such a sacrifice is to place families themselves on the altar of religious extremism , an extremism which denies women their right place in humanity , which sacrifices the welfare of children to a very narrow and restricted religious belief .
And if you want to go back to the earliest examples of horizontal transfer studies you need to study Crown Gall in plants caused by Agrobacterium tumifaciens . You can start here . http : //www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/44/4 ... e2=tf_ipsecsha Which is a later paper by A.C. Braun regarding is 1950s work on crown gall and his finding of the so called tumor inducing principle . Something that Agrobacterium appeared to transfer to plant cells which resulted in tumor like growth and so forth . He got a lot of funding by calling it `` Plant Cancer '' back then . What it turned out to be was transfer of plasmid borne genes to the plant tissue . Brauns work is absolutely classic . He got to the essential conclusions long before most of the tools of molecular biology were available . Think and experiment , use logic , do more experiments . He like Mendel managed to abstract what he was observing without being able to get down to the level of actual mechanisms . It turned out decades later that the plasmid in Agrobacterium forms a good basis for making genetically engineered plants . In the 1970s I had the pleasure of working with some of the people who uncovered the plasmid and watching the story emerge . Some of that story is told in the following by one of the Chiltons . I well remember some of the folks pictured in fig 1. http : //www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/125/1/9 And the following provides some laymen level information regarding crown gall in GE work . http : //courses.washington.edu/z490/gmo/natural.html

One thing that 's surprising about it is that gay pride proponents have been asserting , ever since Prop 8 , that public opinion was overwhelmingly on their side and that it would be voted away once another chance to vote came along . Yet not only did it not get voted down , it did n't even make it onto the ballot . But personally , I 'd rather see such sweeping cultural matters handled via the will of the people rather than an oligarchical court using judicial fiat to favor a minority over everyone else . Though I think the gay pride proponents would fail at the U .S . Supreme Court ( if it gets that far ) .
U.S. Supreme Court 319 U.S. 105 ( 1943 ) MURDOCK v. COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA and seven other cases , including JONES v.

But that is to disregard the nature of this tax . It is a license tax ? a flat tax imposed on the exercise of a privilege granted by the Bill of Rights .

Read the preceding verse . `` 18 The LORD God said , 'It is not good for the man to be alone . I will make a helper suitable for him . 19 Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air . He brought them to the man to see what he would name them ; and whatever the man called each living creature , that was its name . 20 So the man gave names to all the livestock , the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field . But for Adam no suitable helper was found . '' ( Genesis 2:18-20 )

I was watching the Bill Maher show today and they had Jane Fonda on . She mentioned that she has recently become a Christian and that HER god is one that supports a womens right to choice . Now there are so many problems with this that I do n't even know where to start . Not only that , I am saying this as almost a `` newbie '' Christian as in I do n't know everything there is to know about the Bible . However , I do know that the Christian God that is defined in the Bible is against abortion . Many argue that the Bible is not what the Christian God is because it has been translated into a meaningless document . How is this true when we have so many of the original scrolls ? Moreever , how can one claim what God thinks if they do n't have anything to base it on ? For example if you say the Bible is worthless , you are a Christian , and God believes abortion is ok ... then how did you come to this conclusion ? The Christian God talks about how one is created before they were put in the womb . God also talks about not killing . So if you wish to be Christian and for abortion you need to rethink one of those stances . God does n't conform to anyone .

We are separated by reasoning and compassion from the other animals . Theirs is a life based on instinct and a few learned behaviors . For every example you can give me of animals protecting their own young , I can likely present an example where the males ( sometimes the females ) will kill the young of their species just to keep down the competition . A domestic bitch , when presented with a weakling in a litter of pups , will eat the weakling .
The so called `` pro-choice '' movement is in fact in favour of only one choice , ie abortion . For example , a woman who telephones the `` British Pregnancy Advisory Service ( sic ) '' looking for help with a crisis pregnancy will not be given any help or advice . They only deal in abortions , performing over a quarter of all UK abortions . They will not even refer the woman to pro-life organisations such as Life . So much for choice !

What harm will come to society from the marriage of gays ? The most significant impact of legally recognizing same-sex unions would be more indirect . Expanding the definition of what `` marriage '' is to include relationships of a homosexual nature would inevitably , in the long run , change people 's concept of what marriage is , what it requires , and what one should expect from it . These changes in the popular understanding of marriage would , in turn , change people 's behavior both before and during marriage .

] How many different ways can ToE be invalidated ? In a scientific theory , there are NO exceptions -- exceptions mean holes -- holes mean trouble . The answer is none so far .

The memo is real , nobody has ever been able to disprove it . Handgun Control Inc. ( the people who later became the Brady Campaign ) have claimed that the memo is a hoax and that what was released has never been their official position . However them simply stating this , is no different than Obama making a statement on national news , and then several months later saying `` I never said that '' and trying to reverse his position . Until it can be proven beyond doubt as being untrue and simple propaganda , the memo is real and explains in detail exactly what the gun control groups are after .
First of all , we are supposed to be introducing ourselves , not starting up a topic . But let me kill two birds with one stone here . Hi everyone , I 'm new here . And I love to debate . I got kicked out of one debate , because I won the debate on linguistics , and the girl got mad , because she lost , and banned me from the froum . Hopefully no one here is as immature as that . But anyway , thats my story , I 'm glad to be here . And I 'm ready to debate . And here is my first victim . I 'm against gay marriages . Why ? ! Because in order to mantain a healthy environment for children . ( which they always seem to want to adopt ) there has to be a healthy relationship . Now a child grows up , and sees two men/women dating eachother . That can confuse the child as to whether they should also be gay . It is not only harmful to the family environment , but also to society . And do n't hand me that , '' My uncle is gay . '' Stuff . I had ( he passed away ) a gay uncle , have three gay cousins , and a gay aunt . Not my whole family is not gay , but it seems like I have quite a few in my family . Now I do n't support what they do . Even though I love them because they are my family , I would not support them if they were to marry .
What is the problem here ? Guns or crooks stealing guns ? They steal from all of society including LEOs , the military etc . not unlike the situation in Mexico .

First off this is not an accurate depiction of atheism . Atheism does n't dictate how the universe was created or what happens after death . It just says that there is no god . Other than that it 's up to you to think , use your brain . This is also why the thread title : `` I do n't have enough faith to be an atheist '' is not accurate . All you have to do is believe that we were n't created by God . It does n't in any way relate to evolution , the big bang , etc .
Please do n't neglect the importance of this question since it lies at the very heart of the pro-life view of the beginning of human rights . If you want women to give up their rights to their own bodies because of the significance of this transition ( i.e . conception ) , then it is critically important that you detail what it is in the transition that makes it so significant .
And you just sound ignorant . You would n't make this statement if you knew about how Britain 's current gun control laws came into existence .

As you noted , Supersport 's theory predicts DNA from extinct species to be the same as modern DNA .

What are the reasons which you would present behind the statement `` all human life is sacred '' ( or whichever similar statement you think is the core of your pro-life stance ) ? If morality is based only on arbitrary proclamations , then there is little chance of consensus because other groups or religions come up with other arbitrary set of rules and we are back to the situation of , in the worst case , chaos and , in the best case , a majority imposing arbitrary rules on an unwilling suffering minority . I suspect that a lot of people , if not most people , at least partially follow some version of `` treat others as you would have yourself be treated '' . When , as children , we were scolded `` How would you like it if ... '' that is a tactic of teaching this rule . For those who are religious ( which I only marginally , occasionally and hesitatingly am ) , even Jesus stated `` Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you . '' in the Sermon on the Mount talk ( as quoted by ShadowPikachu ) . Many world religions and philosophies seem to incorporate that general rule , which is partly why I think it has a reasonable chance at being incorporated as a global base of morality .

3a ) If you do the math , severe earthquakes ( caused by God ) could have very easily covered the Earth in approximately 2 miles of water at some points . Also , with these severe earthquakes , not all of the Earth would have to be covered equally at one time .

I believe that God made the Earth only a few thousand years ago , not that much geographically different from the way it is now .

This is , simply put , false . murdere is unlawful killing , so as long as abortion remains legal , it is not murder any more than killing in self-defense is .

When is enough enough ?
You folks ca n't box with God , your arms ai n't long enough . Many arguments are made about whether creation or evolution should be taught in our schools . I believe in creationism because I have never met an evolutionist who can explain where the very first sign of life came from . Can something not alive give birth to life ? Can something not alive change to be alive ? The answer to both questions is NO ! There are many things I do n't know , but two things I do know are science will never create anything from nothing and science will never create life from nonlife . I still think that it takes more faith to believe in evolution than it does to believe in our creator
Problem is , the child support is n't owed to the woman but the child . Before abortion , the child can not claim any rights on anyone as it is not accepted as a person . Afterwards , it is a different issue .

While Bush did indeed threaten to veto if there was no such amendment , I 'm not sure why he 's the focus here , or at least the total focus -- the House of Representatives is the one that voted 224-200 for passing this amendment ensuring federal dollars could n't be used . That 's right -- your Democratic-majority congress . ( http : //www.hrc.org/Template.cfm ? Sect ... entDisplay.cfm ) ( and given the numbers , obviously a lot of Democrats voted against the funding .

While most of the commonly held conjecture certainly fits the evidence at hand , there may be other explanations , explanations we have not even thought of yet , that also fit the evidence .

That is a lot , but I want gun control . I want : 1 ) Instant background checks . No waiting period . No cool off time . No central database of gun owners . 2 ) Larger budget for law enforcement for persecution of firearm offenders .

The book does n't address it at all , this book written by a `` Christian '' who claims to be attempting to find common ground between God and evolution . ... . If you had a book by a creationist who claimed to compare evolution and Christianity , and spent almost the entire book searching scripture and ignoring evolution , would you come to the conclusion that he rejects evolution ?
Only that many textbooks the over the whole world have used this famous example as proof of evolution . Many evolutionists have used this same argument .

`` Results . After adjustment , individuals in possession of a gun were 4.46 ( P < .05 ) times more likely to be shot in an assault than those not in possession . Among gun assaults where the victim had at least some chance to resist , this adjusted odds ratio increased to 5.45 ( P < .05 ) . Conclusions . On average , guns did not protect those who possessed them from being shot in an assault . Although successful defensive gun uses occur each year , the probability of success may be low for civilian gun users in urban areas . Such users should reconsider their possession of guns or , at least , understand that regular possession necessitates careful safety countermeasures .

Strange that you seem to miss the meaning of your own quotes . Of course the phrase , `` survival of the fittest '' is a tautology .
It is assumed here that this structure is the result of the hierarchical order of the interaction energies of the bases in codonanticodon recognition . The proposed structure demonstrates that in the genetic code there is a balance between conservatism and innovation . Comparing aligned positions in homologous protein sequences two different behaviors are found : a ) There are sites in which the different amino acids present may be explained by one or two attractor nodes ( coding for the dominating amino acid ( s ) ) and their onebit neighbors in the codon hypercube , and b ) There are sites in which the amino acids present correspond to codons located in closed paths in the hypercube . The structure of the code facilitates evolution : the variation found at the variable positions of proteins do not corresponds to random jumps at the codon level , but to well defined regions of the hypercube .

To you , it may be an incorrect statement . But if it is , you have to tell me what it is you kill and take the life away from when you abort the zygote . Not knowing if it is being killed or not knowing someone wants to kill it makes no difference . Injustice is still practiced there , and not even some abortion doctors realize it .

No you face it . Science has managed to show that life and non-life are not distinct and are indeed simply a continuium of molecular complexity and function . There is no clear difference which can separate life from molecules which are generally NOT considered to be living . There is only matter and energy found in configurations of widely differing complexity thats it so far as matter/energy at the basic temperature range we exist in . Nobody is stumped by this at all . Indeed one might well declare that life is dead - except it sounds strange .
Changing definitions just to satisfy the ego of any one group is patently ridiculous . One might ask why we ca n't call ourselves female when we are actually male or why males should n't be allowed to enroll in an all girls school .
Once again came from the article : Many biologists start with theories and then test them in the field . Majerus takes the opposite and less fashionable approach : `` There 's another way of doing science , which is first find your organism and look at it incredibly closely , for a long time , in great detail and see what questions it asks you , '' he says.
Since when has a big bang anywhere produced the order that we see in the Universe ? Big bangs can not produce the order that we see in the planets .
The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics began at the Fall . This law says that the entropy ( disorder ) of the Universe increases over time , and some have thought that this was the result of the Curse . However , disorder isnt always harmful . An obvious example is digestion , breaking down large complex food molecules into their simple building blocks . Another is friction , which turns ordered mechanical energy into disordered heatotherwise Adam and Eve would have slipped as they walked with God in Eden ! A less obvious example to laymen might be the sun heating the Earthto a physical chemist , heat transfer from a hot object to a cold one is the classic case of the Second Law in action . Also , breathing is based on another classic Second Law process , gas moving from a high pressure to low pressure . Finally , all beneficial processes in the world , including the development from embryo to adult , increase the overall disorder of the universe , showing that the Second Law is not inherently a curse . Death and suffering of nephesh animals before sin are contrary to the Biblical framework above , as are suffering ( or groaning in travail ( Rom . 8:2022 ) ) . It is more likely that God withdrew some of His sustaining power ( Col. 1:1517 ) at the Fall so that the decay effect of the Second Law was no longer countered .

Any random change in a complex , specific , functioning system wrecks that system . And living things are the most complex functioning systems in the universe .
It is now well established that the pattern of diversity at a molecular level conforms to a highly ordered hierarchic system . Each class at a molecular level is unique , isolated and unlinked by intermediates . Thus molecules , like fossils have failed to provide the elusive intermediates so long sought by evolutionary biology .
You are using the logical fallacy of 'equivication ' . While a scientific theory is an 'educated ' guess in some respects , it is much more than that . A scientific theory is a model to explain the observed facts , is testable , has been throughly tested , has explainatory powers , and has not been able to be falsified . That makes it much more than a mre 'educated guess ' .

Yep it is easy . Lizards did n't evolve an avian lung . This should be easy for the creationist : The avian lung is far more efficient than the mammalian lung .

... it should be banned . However , in the course of banning the right the choose abortion allowances must be made . These are in regards to providing for the pregnant couple the services they need . I also think some `` PR '' work would need to be done to accomplish the destigmatization of unwed mothers so they really felt like they could unshamefully carry a child to term . Of course , I understand some folks think that they should be ashamed to be having sex outside of marriage , but the point here is to decrease the need for abortions . Get rid of the reasons why people have abortions and then ban abortion . Anyone want to live in Utopia ?

Anyway , my perfect image of God has cost me years of pain with a more recent almost crippling of my right leg followed by 7 hours of surgery ( including 11 inches of surgical incision - front and back ) to correct my perfection by removing the debris left by two disintegrating disks and inserting two steel frame disks and screwing two steel rods into my vertebrae in the gutter on either side of my spine . The muscles that used to lie in those gutters are sutured over the top , and they are not happy with their new position .
funny that all proponents of abortion for unwanted pregnancies talk about abortion as if being a political statement : I control my body . Funny that they never think that the reason most women need an abortion was because they could n't control their legs and kept them crossed . They can not control their lust , so much for body control .
So , you think there is a God ? Bad design does not equate to no design . It really is a poor argument . Much of the force of Darwin 's arguments deal with bad design . I invite anyone to post any of Darwin 's arguments that specifically outline his case against design because of `` bad '' design . That said , consider this , your car is said to operate at 25 % fuel efficiency . One could claim then the car is 75 % bad design , therefore it is not designed , and if it is , certainly not by anyone of any intelligence . Your audio CD 's have Reed-Solomon error correction because the read/write process is full of errors that need correcting . Cleary this is `` bad design '' that engineers would create read/write heads that make so many errors in the first place . Same with modems and host of other devices . Clearly if in the remote chance these bad designs are evidence of design , the designers must be clueless ! Poorly designed dramas have villains and heroes . Clearly a drama ( even a divine drama ) is poorly designed if it has villains in the story . All the characters should be Pollyanna and there should be no great tragedies on the road to a happy ending . Life and the Divine drama , like CD 's and cars , are clearly not designed , or at least not designed by anyone with intelligence , because of all the bad design woven into the designs . The reason audio CD 's have so many read/write errors which are corrected Reed-Solomon error correction ( somewhat like us reading someone 's writing and mentally correcting spelling and grammar errors ) is that it is the most optimal way to get as much data on a CD as possible . The tightest packing of data implies the highest amount of errors based on the Shannon capacity theorem . The Mp3 's and JPEGS are even more `` error '' prone in that they are inexact representations of the original sound or picture , but the goal was not fidelity but compactness . A similar consideration is for the 75 % inefficiency for cars . The goal is for higher acceleration and agility and cost , etc. , not fuel efficiency . The point is `` bad '' design , in the grand scheme of things , might not be bad design after all . The high rate of sickness and death , the eventual death of the universe as predicted by the 2nd law of thermodynamics are not evidences that the Designer is unwise , any more than the many errors in the read/write process of audio CD suggests the engineers of those devices are incompetent . Origin of Species Chapter 13 : There is another and equally curious branch of the present subject ; namely , the comparison not of the same part in different members of a class , but of the different parts or organs in the same individual . Most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous with that is correspond in number and in relative connexion with the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae . The anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and articulate classes are plainly homologous . We see the same law in comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans . It is familiar to almost every one , that in a flower the relative position of the sepals , petals , stamens , and pistils , as well as their intimate structure , are intelligible in the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves , arranged in a spire . In monstrous plants , we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another ; and we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals , and in flowers , that organs which when mature become extremely different , are at an early stage of growth exactly alike . How inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation ! Why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone ? As Owen has remarked , the benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition of mammals , will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of birds . Why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the wing and leg of a bat , used as they are for such totally different purposes ? Why should one crustacean , which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts , consequently always have fewer legs ; or conversely , those with many legs have simpler mouths ? Why should the sepals , petals , stamens , and pistils in any individual flower , though fitted for such widely different purposes , be all constructed on the same pattern ? On the theory of natural selection , we can satisfactorily answer these questions . Homology was a pre-darwinian idea with the term coined by Owen who rather despised Darwin and his ideas . Darwin tries to argue why a Designer would not use the same for the same function . He says homology is evidence of an unwise design . The premise is a Creator would n't be so inefficient . But , unless one has a handle on the teleological goal , one is free to fabricate all manner of `` bad design '' arguments ( for example read/write errors in audio CD 's or fuel inefficient cars ) . The Biotic Message Theory suggest the teleological goal for biotic reality is to communicate to humans that there is one Designer and author of life , and that life could not have evolved . Like a great novel , the `` imperfections '' of biology are part of a larger plot . It is turning out , Darwin 's argument from homology is a concept in crisis .
Why not ?

The genomic origins and the associations of human nuclear and cytosolic polyadenylated RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides ( nt ) and whole-cell RNAs less than 200 nt were investigated in this genome-wide study . Subcellular addresses for nucleotides present in detected RNAs were assigned , and their potential processing into short RNAs was investigated . Taken together , these observations suggest a novel role for some unannotated RNAs as primary transcripts for the production of short RNAs . Three potentially functional classes of RNAs have been identified , two of which are syntenically conserved and correlate with the expression state of protein-coding genes . These data support a highly interleaved organization of the human transcriptome .

For obvious reasons we Christians have always been adamant supporters of civil liberties when it comes to freedom of religion . We have even managed to be consistent in this principle by not opposing the rights of Buddhists , New Agers , or even Satanists to meet , because we realize that to do so would equally undercut our own right to assemble . Perhaps the thought of undermining religious freedom sends through our minds flashes of those days when the Emperor Nero used to ignite Christians as human torches to light the streets of Rome at night . The persecutions against the early church have ingrained into our Christian consciousness the incredible value of living under a government that protects the interests of religion . But in the case of civil same-sex marriage , instead of recognizing the civil rights issue at stake here , we oppose the idea , quoting Bible verses and appealing to morals , nature , tradition , history , and the fear that Western civilization as we know it will come crashing to the ground . All of these arguments are related , of course . They are an appeal to that part of American society in which Judeo-Christian values are still deeply rooted . For even in America at the dawning of the 21st century , many people 's understanding of morality and nature still reflect the vestiges of the Western Christendom of our heritage , as do their ideas of tradition , history and an ideal society . We do not , however , argue against civil same-sex marriage in the spirit of calm persuasion . There is desperation in our tone . There is also a great deal of fear and mean-spiritedness in our rhetoric , to the point where we even accuse homosexuals ( without much proof , I might add ) of being child molesters and sexual predators , and of seeking to corrupt our youth by recruiting them into their `` lifestyle . '' There are probably many people who think they are justified in having such fears , but it seems to me it is more than just paranoia that feeds our frenzy . We feel deeply threatened , for we sense that we are losing the battle . Not simply the battle against homosexuals , but the battle to hang on to what we still think of as `` Christian America . '' At one time in this country we could count on quoting a verse from Genesis or Leviticus before Congress or the Supreme Court and that would be the end of the debate . No more . The consensus of common biblical values on which we had once depended is giving way to the pluralism of a postmodern society . And seeing the disastrous handwriting on the wall , we have become politically desperate , and so we lunge at the enemies of Christendom with a ferocity that rivals that of even the most radical gay activists .

Our country is bigger , has a bigger military , and we would now know if the Iranian military was attacking us before they left their own country . We no longer have to worry about `` invasion '' by another nation . IMHO , it is the the modern quasi-militia type people and those who are continuously stocking up on sterno , camo , ammo , and NBC gear that are the major problem in this country that makes everybody else wonder why we allow our citizens to still carry guns . You can own guns responsibly , the can be a source of entertainment , and a great hobby . But seriously guys ... what is wrong with someone questioning why we have guns ? Some of your responses make ALL gun owners look like paranoid , itchy people just waiting for the russians to come . GROW UP .

Is your point that citizens should be allowed to have guns to defend themselves from the government or that citizens should be allowed to have guns to protect themselves from other citizens ? As for protecting form the government , I highly doubt that the U.S. military would be used to massacre U.S. citizens because its actions are far too public . It certaintly is possible that a more secretive organization such as the NSA would be able to carry out plans such as the ones which you described in other countries . However , do you think it would be possible for ordinary citizens armed with firearms to stop the highly trained employees of the NSA ? As for protection from other citizens , I think that the government should allow this , but I also think that people should n't have guns . So if the number of guns owned by citizens in the U.S. were to decrease , I would want it to be a voluntary change , not one forced by the government . There should still be gun regulation just as there is regulation of any product on the market .

I really have to commend AIG in that they did not list `` Dr. '' Kent Hovind , `` Dr. '' Carl Baugh , `` Dr. '' Don Patton . However , the AIG does list Thomas Barnes who 's highest earned degree is an MS in physics , his Sc.D being honorary from his undergraduate , Christian university . Clifford Burdick has a `` degree '' from a non-university ( as described in the mimeographed bulletin of the `` University of Physical Sciences '' , from which Burdick claimed his degree : `` 'The University is not an educational institution , but a society of individuals of common interest for the advancement of physical science . There are no campus , professors or tuition fee . `` ) . Harold Slusher has an honorary degree from a Bible college with only a 1/2 man graduate science department in addition to his `` degree '' from Columbia Pacific University a non-accredited correspondence school that promises a degree in less than a year . I do note that Clifford Burdick is listed on list of deceased scientists who believed in a creator . I presume that the rest of the `` scientists '' listed by AIG actually have the PhDs that AIG claims of all 182 listed .

Dying Lesbian 's Partner Denied Access To Her by 365Gay.com Newscenter Staff Posted : February 22 , 2008 - 1:00 pm ET ( Miami , Florida ) Janice Langbehn and Lisa Pond had planned to take their three children on a family cruise . The Olympia , Washington couple had been together 18 years and with their children were looking forward to the holiday . But just as they were about to depart on the cruise from Miami , Florida . Pond , a healthy 39-year-old , suddenly collapsed . She was rushed to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami with Langbehn and the children following close behind . But once Langbehn and the children arrived at the hospital the hospital refused to accept information from her about Pondss medical history . Langbehn says she was informed that she was in an antigay city and state , and she could expect to receive no information or acknowledgment as family . A doctor finally spoke with Janice telling her that there was no chance of recovery . Other than one five minute visit , which was orchestrated by a Catholic priest at Langbehns request to perform last rites , and despite the doctors acknowledgement that no medical reason existed to prevent visitation , neither she nor her children were allowed to see Pond until nearly eight hours after their arrival . Soon after Pond's death , Langbehn tried to get her death certificate in order to get life insurance and Social Security benefits for their children . She was denied both by the State of Florida and the Dade County Medical Examiner . http : //www.365gay.com/Newscon08/02/022208fla.htm Note the above . She was informed she was in an `` anti-gay state '' ... 1 ) As I have pointed out before , some of the `` anti-gay marriage '' amendments go well and beyond just `` no gay marriage '' to antagonizing gays by stating in law that gays can not perform certain legal functions , regardless of whether or not it is called `` marriage '' . 2 ) Does anybody have any real doubt that if the two ladies had just walked in as `` friends '' , that this problem would not have happened ? 3 ) I think this furthers my point regarding how some people 's actions and statements FURTHER anti-gay bullying , and that refusing to acknowledge this relationship , or `` blame '' , is futile . The hospital perpetrated this gross violation of human decency invoking the STATE stance .

In fetal development , most major organs exist in rudimentary form by about 8 to 9 weeks . It takes several months for these organs to grow in size , complexity , and organization to the point they can function . For example , the myelin sheaththe insulating cover on nerve pathways that is required for efficient conduction of pain signalsdoes not begin forming around nervous system cells ( neurons ) in the spinal cord until about 24 weeks , and not till after birth in most of the cerebral cortex . [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] Although sporadic brain waves can be detected by about 21 weeks gestation , genuine continuous brain waves do not begin until about 28 weeks , [ 9 ] indicating that the nerve circuits needed to carry pain impulses to the brain are not fully connected till then . This also marks the beginnings of conscious awareness , which is generally considered a requirement for experiencing pain .
Taken to its logical extreme , we might argue that , just as a federal felon , serving time , has some First Amendment rights to the press , petition and religion , or Eighth Amendment rights not to be subjected to cruel punishment , so too , a prisoner might claim some second amendment right .

It was so held by this court in the case of U. S. v. Cruikshank , 92 U.S. 542 , 553 , in which the chief justice , in delivering the judgment of the court , said that the right of the people to keep and bear arms 'is not a right granted by the constitution . Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence . The second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed , but this , as has been seen , means no more than that it shall not be infringed by congress . This is one of the amendments that has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government ,
I must be VEEEERY mistaken then . Read my other post , no children are dying here .

You talk only of punishing pregnant women , when you do not talk of men .

Today , almost half a century after the publication of the encyclical ( Humani Generis ) , new knowledge has led to the recognition of the theory of evolution as more than a hypothesis . ( Aujourdhui , près dun demi-siècle après la parution de l'encyclique , de nouvelles connaissances conduisent à reconnaitre dans la théorie de l'évolution plus qu'une hypothèse . ) It is indeed remarkable that this theory has been progressively accepted by researchers , following a series of discoveries in various fields of knowledge . The convergence , neither sought nor fabricated , of the results of work that was conducted independently is in itself a significant argument in favor of this theory .

President Obama poses a real and present danger to the Second Amendment , and he 's working to pack the Supreme Court with justices who will undermine Americans ' gun rights . Mr. Obama did n't fess up to this radical agenda when running for the highest office in the land . `` I have said consistently that I believe that the Second Amendment is an individual right , and that was the essential decision that the Supreme Court came down on , '' Mr. Obama told Fox News in June 2008 . Despite the campaign rhetoric , Mr. Obama is appointing judges who strongly oppose that position . The most recent pick , Elena Kagan , ran much of President Clinton 's war on guns from 1995 to 1999 . When Ms. Kagan served as Mr. Clinton 's deputy domestic policy adviser , she was a feverish proponent of gun control . From gunlock mandates to gun-show regulations , she was instrumental in pushing anti-gun policies , according to the Los Angeles Times . Every court nomination counts . Two years ago , the Supreme Court barely mustered a narrow 5-4 majority to strike down the extreme District of Columbia gun ban . Should Justice Anthony Kennedy or one of the four more conservative justices retire or die while Mr. Obama is in office , the high court likely will undo such narrow victories for the Second Amendment . While Ms. Kagan was nominated to replace the liberal Justice John Paul Stevens , and thus wo n't swing the court in a new direction , her being there will necessitate that gun owners concentrate more than ever on fighting outright gun bans . Ms. Kagan 's defenders acknowledge her liberal political views but claim that as a judge , the former Harvard Law School dean will somehow manage to separate her judgments from her political opinions . The hitch is that her legal views correspond with her political views . When Ms. Kagan clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall , she wrote , `` I 'm not sympathetic '' to the claim that `` the District of Columbia 's firearms statutes violate [ an individual 's ] constitutional right to 'keep and bear Arms . ' `` Her memos to Justice Marshall foreshadow an activist judge who would n't hesitate to fall back on her own personal views to override policy decisions made by elected officials . She clearly counseled Justice Marshall on how he should rule based upon whether she thought policies made `` sense . '' Take her advice in the case of Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council , in which an appeals court stopped federal agencies from issuing a permit to build a ski lodge in a national forest . Ms. Kagan might feel that stopping ski resorts from such building makes `` policy sense , '' but that is n't the job of a judge . Ms. Kagan is Justice Sonia Sotomayor 's soul sister when it comes to gun control . Last year , during her confirmation hearings , Ms. Sotomayor insisted the Supreme Court had never found that an individual right to self-defense exists . Two of Justice Sotomayor 's own appeals court decisions came to the same conclusion . One ruling denied there is an individual right to self-defense . In another case , even after the Supreme Court struck down the District 's gun ban , Judge Sotomayor opined that any restrictions on self-defense would pass constitutional muster so long as politicians who passed it said they had a good reason . Senators must realize that a vote for Ms. Kagan for the Supreme Court is another vote against gun rights .

I think it 's fair . The pro-gun side has a consistent history of being in favor of protecting individual rights against collective entities like government and big businesses . The gun-ban side has a consistent history of being in favor of the removal of individual rights and trying to criminalize lawful behavior because they do n't like it . If you ca n't stand the heat then stay out of the furnace !

Evolution is not needed to explain such an event , as natural selection clearly accounts for it .
When I was in college a particularly difficult physics professor gave us the task of proving the existance of the wind . Interestingly enough , it can not be done . You can not see it , you can not catalog it , and you can not touch it . You can not measure it , though you can measure its effects . you can not write any proof for the existance of the wind . While many people may argue that you CAN proove the existance of the wind by observing its effects , this is not really a valid way to a proof in physics . In the end , it comes down to faith . We can see the effects of the wind , we can feel the effects of the wind , so we believe it is there .
Persoanlly , I think both sides are wrong . I think that the evolutionists have fallen prey to the arrogance of the soft sciences . In striving to understand something , they have taken a relatively small body of evidence , made up a big story around it , and told themselves `` we know it all now '' rather than accepting that their explanation may not be entirely correct .

This is yet another shameful example of the godless attitude of science .
Hello , Nu Leader . Nor was the peppered moth example ever meant to `` prove '' evolution .

The abilty to reason comes from the abilty to ask the question , why . A hunter animal sees its prey running and runs after it , it doesnt ask itself why it runs , a grass eating animal eats grass , it doesnt ask why it grows . The first thing a human thinks is why , then tries to reason to find an answer . If you combine that with natural instincts , you get a creature that slowly evolves by using reason . Humans maybe stubborn , they insist there is an answer to everything , and when they cant find that answer using reason and logic , they resort to `` escapism '' and answer such questions in a way that hides there lack of understanding , by creating gods to explain the yet unexplainable . Thats maybe why we pray .
If someone gives you an eye witness account of an event that happened before your time and all the evidence that you have collected does not contradict that account , is it no logical and rational to believe that eye witness ' account ? In a similar way , we have the Word of our Creator who does n't lie and who was there in the beginning . The actual physical evidence fits nicely with what we would expect if the Bible is right , e.g . fossils , mutations , the fact that there are billions of sea things burried in massive `` underwater graves '' all over the Earth - some while still eating or giving birth ( i.e . had to be rapid ) . So if the evidence that we have collected does not contradict what His eye witness account says ( i.e . Genesis ) than , is it not logical and rational to believe it to be true ? In fact , it would be illogical and irrational to not believe it !

Sorry if this is the wrong forum , but a weapon is a weapon so here I am . I am a photographer , and I photograph mostly landscapes and cityscapes . I have traveled to numerous cities ( LA , 'Frisco , NYC , etc . ) to photograph its buildings , culture , and people . The law regarding the carry and use of pepper spray does not make any sense to me . In all of these places , I am not legally permitted to carry pepper spray because of my age . In all three of these cities as in most states , it is illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to carry pepper spray . Are n't we the ones who need the most protection ? I 'm only 16 , and I 'm a little short and quite skinny . I seriously do n't feel safe marching around the city sporting expensive and flashy camera gear , but I do n't really have a choice . Some of the most interesting places to photograph are poverty stricken and usually unsafe . With child molesters , rapists , robbers , etc out there just waiting to take advantage of a minor because of his/her small size , would n't the carrying of pepper spray not only be legal but encouraged ? I do n't understand how any state could leave one of their physically weakest minorities so vulnerable . I can understand limiting the possession of knives and guns to minors , because those are both deadly weapons and , to be frank , some of my peers are numbskulls . But , both pepper spray and stun guns have been proven to do no permanent damage to the human body . By the time one is about 15 , one is responsible enough to know not to spray someone because `` he gave me a funny look '' , `` I do n't like him '' , or employ its use in a fist fight . If every child molester knew most teenagers were packin non-lethal weapons , do you think he would still attack ? Can someone please explain this to me ?
A little antiabortion propaganda for your commute Ads , paid for by a Roman Catholic group , that ask `` Abortion : Have We Gone Too Far ? '' are n't faring very well on the Bay Area Rapid Transit System , the San Francisco Chronicle reported Friday . `` One ad , headlined '9 months ' in large letters , features nine months of a calendar and reads : 'Because of Roe vs. Wade , this is the amount of time the Supreme Court says it 's legal to have an abortion , ' '' the paper reported . `` The other contains the message : 'The Supreme Court says you can choose : after the heart starts beating , after its arms and legs appear , after all organs are present , after the sex is apparent , after it sucks its thumb , after it responds to sounds , after it could survive outside the womb . ' '' The campaign , which began three weeks ago , and cost $ 43,200 , consists of 280 ads on BART cars and 48 larger versions in train stations . It was paid for by Respect Life Ministry of the Oakland Diocese of the Roman Catholic Church . BART says that it had to accept the ads , since they 're a form of free speech under the First Amendment . But the campaign is seeing some vocal dissent from BART riders : `` Critics of the ads also seem to be taking matters into their own hands . Hundreds of the ads have been defaced with markers , had stickers placed over them or have been torn down and ripped up , according to Monika Rodman , coordinator of the group that placed the ads . `` 'The defacement has taken to religious epithets , profanity , everything you can think of , ' she said . A billboard at the MacArthur station in Oakland was torn to shreds , she said , and mini-essays were written on others . `` So many of the ads have been destroyed , she said , that a supply of a couple of dozen extras has been exhausted , and the ministry has ordered reinforcements from its printer . The group , which funded the campaign through donations , according to Rodman , is also asking BART 's ad agency , CBS Outdoor ( formerly Viacom Outdoor ) , for extra display time to compensate for the vandalism . '' Let 's hope that the controversy over the defacement of the ads does n't help the Catholic group 's fundraising so Bay Area commuters wo n't have to put up with still more of this nonsense on the way to work . -- Katharine Mieszkowski

But when hundreds of loud and angry strangers are descending on your family , your children , and your home , a more apt description of this assemblage would be `` mob .

Playing God 's advocate here . Most , but not all , religions assume that there 's a special relationship between God and man . Almost symbiotic , although that does n't quite catch all the subtleties . If evolution is true , then the universe was around for billions of years , as was the earth , before people showed up . If we are God 's special interest , then he probably would n't have waited around billions of years for us to evolve . If we `` just happened '' then most religion 's idea that God cares about us in some special way is thrown into serious doubt .

No , he is right . You 're thinking about evidence after it 's been interpreted rather than the raw data available to all - which is not to say that it is equally scrutinised by all . The difference is that the interpretation of those facts that supports common descent is based on axioms that have many times proved their worth as accurate and predictive . That 's the part Ken does n't seem to appreciate : although axioms are indeed stated rather than derived or proved , where they lead you , the expectations they engender , can be compared with reality in order to see whether your axioms are congruent with those upon which reality operates .
Faith by definition is a belief without evidence .

Historically , the causes and origins of crime have been the subjects of investigation by many disciplines . Some factors that are known to affect the volume and type of crime occurring from place to place are : Population density and degree of urbanization . Variations in composition of the population , particularly youth concentration . Stability of population with respect to residents ' mobility , commutingXpatterns , and transient factors . Modes of transportation and highway system . Economic conditions , including median income , poverty level , and job availability . Cultural factors and educational , recreational , and religious characteristics . Family conditions with respect to divorce and family cohesiveness . Climate . Effective strength of law enforcement agencies . Administrative and investigative emphases of law enforcement . Policies of other components of the criminal justice system ( i.e. , prosecutorial , judicial , correctional , and probational ) . Citizens ' attitudes toward crime . Crime reporting practices of the citizenry .

Are you sure about that ? Heterosexual sex goes as follows : The female 's one millimeter hole gets a one inch hidious peg rammed into it , tearing the hole until it is big enough for the peg . Wow , how ... not physical damaging . I think lesbian activities are a lot less harmful .
And it also took an amendment to give the slaves rights , not a judge .
So why do some feel it necessary to deceive in order to `` put a lump in the throat '' of the American People ?
Er ... because it 's an important issue to you and he 's your candidate ? ? ? Or it is only an important issue to you on non-election years ? .
It is my understanding that the rules are if you 're banned , you ca n't simply create a new ID and return under it . This happened when Terral03 was banned and returned using a new ID .
... and will come again , so be good for goodness sake ...
One of the most basic reasons why society promotes child abuse murder via abortion is to assauge the cathartic rage , frustrations , hate etc of female citizen-slaves . I have no doubt that abortion acts as a legal violence outlet that would otherwise end up in other violence outlets deemed to be crimes by society .
`` If men strive , and hurt a woman with child , so that her fruit depart from her , and yet no mischief follow : he shall be surely punished , according as the woman 's husband will lay upon him ; and he shall pay as the judges determine . And if any mischief follow , then thou shalt give life for life . '' - Ex 20:22-23 this suggests that when an abortion occurs , the one responsible will be punished , but not by death unless the woman is killed . even the bibles says that the mother 's life is more important than the fetus .
Apparently Germany , Portugal and France ( plus the usual suspects : Denmark , Sweden , Finland , Netherlands and Belgium ) are all moving toward or already allow same sex unions . Looks like Europe is quietly adapting to the realities of the modern world whilst the USA tears itself apart over the issue yet again ...
I wonder how many are exaggerated .
I would n't like to credit an economy-wide change with benevolence . Were it a sacrifice avoid employing children , children-employers would have a competitive advantage . Yet they virtually died out in every developed market before any law was passed .
No , not COULD happen , it HAS happened already , this is the reality of the situation .
And as I said before . Bloomberg makes absolutely no recommendation for what to do with these 35 , supposedly , criminals sellers . He did n't want them charged with felonies , he did n't file civil suits against them , he did n't do anything . He just got the `` evidence '' he wanted and then he let them go scot free as if they 'd done nothing . Obviously New York City style catch and release justice at its absolute finest .
I think it 's nonsense interpretation developed by people who were afraid that if they fought for guns as valiantly as they did for free speech , they would n't receive any donations .
One item that shoud be mentioned is that this expidition set out in this area specifically to find the transitional form between land and water creatures . They went looking in this area because that had the right geology , with the rocks the right age . They found what they had predicted they would find.. and what they specificlaly were looking for .
What 's your point ? Of course they will be bound by Heller just as the courts are bound by Roe v. Wade . That point was n't in dispute . As long as you 're talking about 19th Century Second Amendment case law , I like The State v. Buzzard ( 1842 ) .
How many people would be capable of doing that to themselves ?

Maybe Massachusetts should allow for divorces via notarized mail by non-residents or whatever else is needed to make it easier to do so remotely and more timely , if someone has a serious need to get a legal divorce for such a marriage that only exists somewhere else .
what evidence ? like the beaks of finches growing a few centimeters ? ... like the color patterns on moths changing in just a few years ? ... .like size/color of fish changing accomodate their surroundings ? There is no proof of anything but the small stuff . There are no intermediates linking higher classes of animals .
It is much more important that you concern yourself with the destiny of your soul , not how many years you can stay on the earth .
It is legal for a woman to abort a fetus in the first trimester , and further along if there are complications . No repercussions , no trials for murder , just kill the baby , it is n't viable yet ... But on the other hand , a pregnant woman is attacked in her first trimester and her baby dies . Her attacker is charged with murder of an unborn child , or intentional/unintentional conduct against a pregnancy . A pregnant woman is attacked and murdered . Now her attacker faces double homicide . My question is why is it ok for a woman to kill her baby and it is perfectly legal , but if someone else does it , why are they charged with murder , or manslaughter ?
Sadly policy needs no law for justifucation . The VA is a law unto themselves as anyone who has delt with them finds out .
Is n't it wrong to violate women 's rights on a chance guess or ( at best ) a gut feeling or a belief in a perhaps completely mythical God ? We know she deserves rights .
But that can be tested at whatever level you want to use for `` kind '' and shown to be false . Has been shown to be false by phylogenetic analysis . No application of the mistaken Razor .
We have on this board alone , demands on our Constitution 's Bill of Rights of total Gun Registration , Mandatory Storage with as of yet undefined penalties , a photo ID .
Evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin said : we have a prior commitment to materialism . It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us to accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world , but , on the contrary , that we are forced by our priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations , no matter how counter-intuitive Moreover , that materialism is an absolute , for we can not allow a divine foot in the door.
. But we know there is such a thing as legal precedent , and while your idea of people marrying pets is pretty silly , it is certainly NOT beyond the pale for marriage to be broadened to the point of including other arrangements as well like polygamy in some cases . The idea that gay marriage is not an example if simply broadening and moving marriage to a more wide-open concept for anything like many other examples is pretty ridiculous .
The essence of the discussion is not whether the various creatures adapt to various environments . The discussion is the how .
Nobody is arguing that you should n't use locks on your door . As you yourself are an example , sometimes people forget to lock up . It 's nice to have another option in case things turn out violent .
# 3 Your moronic statement about how there would be no laws without religion discredits your writings anyways . Laws do not stem from religion . They stem from the need for a society to be able to function properly . They stem from mans desire for power . Some do stem from religion but this does not make up the majority . If you wish to try and debate this , why not explain how religious influenced the laws concerning driving on a specific side of the road more than social influences did .
bullsh*t. you do get critized for tlaking about god ... any other god other than the christian god that is
Then a man who needs an artificial heart to survive is a new species of man . That is the analogy I gave , and you ignored . In both cases ; human and bacteria , before the advent of a human product , a particular group of individuals from each larger group would die off .

A simple question really ... if this bill supposedly reduces health care costs per person then who is getting less money ? Please see the below graph to answer this question . http : //biglizards.net/Graphics/Foreg ... bution2007.jpg I 'm honestly asking ... will doctors get paid less ? Will people making health care equipment get paid less ? All of the above ? It wo n't all come from the health insurance companies , in fact , they will probably benefit ( the large ones that is ) . Just tell me ... who gets less money .
Thats nice . How 's those `` 32 '' guns you `` own '' and hows your `` training '' going . Funny though how you can believe or not believe a question ... .
we as humans on this earth are stupid , stupid in the way that we know not of what is going on aorund us . religion was made so that we humans would not feel frightened and alone in this universe . people can not grasp that after we die , we rot in the ground . we can not even imagine non existence .
That 's really simplified . It 's not like a woman 's body is a suitcase and the fetus is biologically self-reliant .
Dembski 's `` explanatory filter '' is nonsense .

By gay bias do you mean disagrees with your opinion ?
A key doctrine in my own faith is that Jesus was born of a virgin , even though it makes no scientific sense - there is the matter of Jesus 's Y-chromosome to account for . But that is the point . Miracles , by definition , do not have to make scientific sense . They are specific acts of God , designed in most cases to get a message across . Their very rarity is what makes them remarkable . An atheist , of course , will argue that miracles are bogus and are stitched together from the needs and desires of human imagination . Maybe so . To a believer , miracles are more than `` violations of the laws of nature , '' as they were described by David Hume . They reflect a greater reality , a spiritual reality , and they occur in a context that makes religious , not scientific , sense . To the nonbeliever , there is no spiritual reality , and hence there are no miracles . To a person of faith , miracles display the greater purposes of God , giving them a meaning that transcends physical reality . If this is true , why should n't we allow that the creation of our species was a miracle ? Or why not agree that the sudden explosion of life in the Cambrian era might have been a miracle ? Both might have been . In 1900 , we could easily have said that the sun 's fire was a miracle . Unable to explain the biological basis of immunity , we could have chalked that up to God , too . And for good measure we could have told our students that the interior heat of the earth might be the work of the devil . We are now far enough along in the development of science to appreciate that its track record suggests that ultimately it will find natural causes for natural phenomena .

That 's exactly it . It 's not as though we can effortlessly rebuttle every single one of your posts as we 've done in the past . It 's not as though we 're tired of your absence when it 's your turn to defend your position . Oh no , it 's only because the cat 's got my tongue .
This is not because her life is sacred , but because her body is her own to control . I think , the point we are really disagreeing on here is that I believe a persons right to have control over their own body is their right naturally , and it dose not depend on the mystical idea that life is sacred .
Lurch , I do n't appreciate your condescending tone . If you want to challenge my assertion that you are a pompous XXX that jumps to conclusions , you will need to be a little less judgemental and start thinking outside of Darwin 's Black Box .
You need to read what people say more thoroughly , and think about it before you respond . When he said `` can '' ( and there are not many simpler words than that ! ) It did n't mean `` will '' , `` must '' , or `` shall '' be more aggressive . It has been shown that in some cases it `` CAN '' happen . It may not have happened with you . It still might , we do n't know . We might even say that it is not likely to happen , but we ca n't say that it wo n't , because sometimes some people do behave more aggressively when they have a gun .
He probably means `` heathens . '' You know those non-fundamentalists , they all look alike !
If I take a simple structure , modify it to form something more complex , is that not a change in complexity ?
Richard Leakey : `` If I were going to draw a family tree for man , I would just draw a huge question mark . ''
A few blocks from my house there is a group of stores with some offices on the second floors . Apparently there is a Planned Parenthood office in the complex because a group of anti-abortion protestors were there the other day . I didnt know that before then . I wondered what they hoped to accomplish by their protest so I asked them . One woman said she hoped to discourage women from considering abortion . I didnt think of it at the time , but Planned Parenthood does a lot more than abortion services . I wonder if the protests might also dissuade a young woman who was seeking contraceptive services from going into that office as well . If this were the case , the abortion protests would accomplish the opposite of their goal . They potentially could have increased the chances of an unwanted pregnancy by discouraging contraceptive use . In turn , this might increase the chances of an abortion . I wonder if anti-abortion folks ever consider that ?
To say a fish became amphibian , and offer no transtional from is ridiculous .
All the knowledge from Science has come from trusting mutual experience . It has gotten us far and will continue to ( as long as we do n't destroy ourselves in misusing that knowledge ) .
On the contrary , the Pro-lifers are acting like the slave traders . Anyone who denies a human being a fundamental human right because of a physical feature is more like the slave traders than everything . Let me also remind you that black people were sentient . Fetuses are not .
Creationism means religion , but it also involves a belief in the authenticity of historical documents that have been meticulously preserved over thousands of years . That 's not just religion , it 's secular , observed history - something evolution does n't have .
America has no reason to listen to people in the uk about gun control and now Knife control when its shockingly clear that criminals can still get any gun they want .
Sigma , I was only joking . It hit me this morning though that if I 'm willing to talk about abortion without bringing up God , I wonder if the Pro-Choicers could argue their position without bringing up `` women 's rights '' . ; - )
They itch .
Well , at least the biological sciences and physics . The physicists also try to devise ways to keep their pet theories afloat so that the vast majority of the population can continue to be snow-blinded . Take their lie that there is some magical attraction between bodies of matter . The truth lies in Intelligent Falling - glory to the intelligent designer .
It is my hope that before I die that I see the barbaric act of legaling killing babies in the womb , Rowe V Wade overturned and give the decision on abortion back to individual state so that all these beautiful babies . gifts from God hve a chance at life ... ... ... ..

Creationists define true Christians to be only those who agree with them . Consequently these clergy are not Christians so their opinions can be discarded .
Obama Pushes Anti-gun Treaty `` In actuality , according to ATF special agent William Newell , about 17 percent of guns associated with crime in Mexico came from the United States . '' I ca n't find a quote from Special Agent Newell saying any such thing . Mr. Newman 's figure of 17 % coming from the US is also erroneous . The 17 % can only be attached to those weapons for which there was a successful trace back to the US from the group of 11,000 submitted by Mexican authorities . The percentage of the total confiscated that actually came from the US is not known since some submitted for trace could n't be traced while the majority confiscated were not even requested to be traced , for whatever reason .
So , by your logic , if there 's a bad cop in New York , then all the cops in Boise , Idaho must be bad as well .

This question is premised on an untenable assumption : that people should not be allowed to vote on particular issues . This premise is clearly not true in any democratic society , and is especially not true in the United States . In the United States , it is a contradiction in terms to say someone is not allowed to vote on X. I have demonstrated this before , and yet the same silly question keeps coming up .

If IC is a concept then it can be defeated by a concept .
If she does not want the child she can refrain from sex , use a contraceptive or abortion . If he does not want it he can refrain from sex ( not likely for men ) , use a condom ( not a guarantee to work ) , have surgery ( hard to reverse ) but that is it .
Not so . Systems are extended , temporally . They are a series of connected , interdependent events , and not a singlular event , by definition . Therefore there is no saying that what determines them is a single set of 'initial conditions ' , since even the simplest allopatric systems [ such as the solar system ] , are constantly and perpetually receiving fresh input on top of whatever their 'initial conditions ' may have been . Initial conditions start systems going , but they continue on thanks to constant input ; otherwise entropy puts a stop to them . Therefore it is false to believe that `` if you could trace the evolution of [ any ] system back in time with perfect accuracy , [ then what it is now ] would all be originally determined by the system 's initial state . `` .
I recall learning about genetics and Mendel at secondary school , but not specifically Darwinism . I learnt more through my own readings when I was young . Most of my academic study on it was n't until University , although I did do some paleontology in my A levels as well as more on genetics .
unkerpaulie I think your analogy breaks down with a little thought . If I have a check for a million dollars and I take it to a copy machine and make a copy , I am quite aware that the copy will not be perfect . There is an imperfect mechanical divice between the check and the copy . Or are you saying that God has a big imperfect copy machine that he jumps into and out pops an imperfect copy . My thought was that God was the direct agent of creation ( without the use of intervening mechanical devices ) , and being a perfect Being incapable creating imperfection ( for then He would not be God ) , all of His creation would be as perfect as He is . So does this perfect God have a spine that is a plethora of engineering disasters ?
Well , this comes from the same people who invented the death pannels . The truth is that all the developed countries ( all of Europe , Canada , Japan , Australia , New Zealand , Taiwan , Israel ) have universal healthcare . Their COST per capita is about half of ours . They have better outcomes . Universal healthcare has been tried in many places and it does work . What does not work is our current system . Wellpoint has just increased premiums by 30 % even wiyhout a reform bill . They spend 30 % on administrative costs . BTW , do you oppose the bill that would force them to limit the administrative costs to 20 % ?
That Department of Justice study does n't support your opinion since it does n't examine crime statistics after the UK gun ban . Sounds like the UK crime rate has been going down to me . Alfaholic is jumping to conclusions .
I 'm not sure on the details of their plan , likely because they are n't sure of them . We 're still in the process of spending around 3 billion to register all the firearms in Canada . The announcement is a blatant attempt to garner votes in Toronto and Ontario , key election areas , where gun violence is highest . I have no use for handguns , and I do n't even know anyone that would be directly affected by the ban , but it 's a matter of principle . It 's the first step on a slippery slope . We all know that the vast majority of gun crime is carried out with registered , legally obtained handguns . Therefore , banning handguns in Canada will surely solve the problem . Where do they find the retards that dream this stuff up ? First of all , handguns are nearly impossible to obtain legally in Canada as it is , 95 % + of handguns used in crimes in Canada have been illegally smuggled into the country from the USA . Even the police forces are saying that the law is pointless as it would only serve to increase the smuggling of handguns from the US , and would likely not have any impact on the rate of handgun use in crimes . On top of that , it would no doubt be another extremely expensive venture . There are times when I really question the intelligence of the average Canadian , especially those in Ontario and Quebec . Some of them need a dose of reality . Waxy

Women have been denigrated and made fun of for centuries . I 've just gotten tired of it -- and righteously so .

Pregnancy is ALWAYS physically harmful . You try carrying a load of extra weight about and see what that does to your heart . It is also always life threatening - women still die from it and you never know how childbirth is going to go . These are the normal , frequent or expectable temporary side effects of pregnancy : -- exhaustion ( weariness common from first weeks ) -- altered appetite and senses of taste and smell -- nausea and vomiting ( 50 % of women , first trimester ) -- heartburn and indigestion -- constipation -- weight gain -- dizziness and light-headedness -- bloating , swelling , fluid retention -- hemmorhoids -- abdominal cramps -- yeast infections -- congested , bloody nose -- acne and mild skin disorders -- skin discoloration ( chloasma , face and abdomen ) -- mild to severe backache and strain -- increased headaches -- difficulty sleeping , and discomfort while sleeping -- increased urination and incontinence -- bleeding gums -- pica -- breast pain and discharge -- swelling of joints , leg cramps , joint pain -- difficulty sitting , standing in later pregnancy -- inability to take regular medications -- shortness of breath -- higher blood pressure -- hair loss -- tendency to anemia -- curtailment of ability to participate in some sports and activities -- infection including from serious and potentially fatal disease ( pregnant women are immune suppressed compared with non-pregnant women , and are more susceptible to fungal and certain other diseases ) -- extreme pain on delivery -- hormonal mood changes , including normal post-partum depression -- continued post-partum exhaustion and recovery period ( exacerbated if a c-section -- major surgery -- is required , sometimes taking up to a full year to fully recover ) These are the normal , expectable , or frequent PERMANENT side effects of pregnancy : -- stretch marks ( worse in younger women ) -- loose skin -- permanent weight gain or redistribution -- abdominal and vaginal muscle weakness -- pelvic floor disorder ( occurring in as many as 35 % of middle-aged former child-bearers and 50 % of elderly former child-bearers , associated with urinary and rectal incontinence , discomfort and reduced quality of life ) -- changes to breasts -- varicose veins -- scarring from episiotomy or c-section -- other permanent aesthetic changes to the body ( all of these are downplayed by women , because the culture values youth and beauty ) -- increased proclivity for hemmorhoids -- loss of dental and bone calcium ( cavities and osteoporosis )

Are poverty and starvation only an excuse for abortions ? - Yahoo ! Mxico Respuestas Are poverty and starvation only an excuse for abortions ? When a serial killer of women acts , nobody says that it is OK because he is getting women `` freedom of misery '' . It is evident that not all his victims were poor and that murder is not the way to solve poverty . Is it not evident then that argument , applied to infanticide is only a dirty trick to say that it is compassionate an evil selfish action ?
