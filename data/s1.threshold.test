"Because you are using a word that already has a definition . Main Entry : mar·riage Pronunciation : \ & # 712 ; mer-ij , & # 712 ; ma-rij\ Function : noun Etymology : Middle English mariage , from Anglo-French , from marier to marry Date : 14th century 1 a ( 1 ) : the state of being united to a person of the opposite sex as husband or wife in a consensual and contractual relationship recognized by law Do you see Jews celebrating Christmas ? NO ! They already have a holiday that is defined . And I believe the only reason they added same sex marriage to Webster 's Dictionary is so not to make flamboyant gay men cry . I am not anti-gay , but I am sick of hearing about it . Your rights do not compare to that of a religious background or ethnicity . That 's like comparing an apple to a cardboard box . The only thing the 2 share is the fact that they are nouns . I agree that it should n't be voted on . That 's a waste of my tax dollar . Do you think I ask the government to give me attention because I JUST HAVE to watch Everybody Loves Raymond in hi def ? And you 're in the wrong category if you mention gay rights and civil rights in the same sentence . Civil rights are non political and gays are always protesting something that has to do with the government . I would also like to add that I think it 's tacky that gays ONLY vote for liberals just because they `` love the gays '' . Those people do n't give a # # # # about you . They say that because the Conservatives have n't and intend to get your vote . Voting for one political party over one issue seems morally wrong . You 're gay . Get over it . Move on ... ... ... ."

"Here is a list of Christian Clergy that is fighting the Fundamentalist anti-intellectualism and quite plainly accepting the fact that the theory of evolution has massive amounts of evidence for it . Within the community of Christian believers there are areas of dispute and disagreement , including the proper way to interpret Holy Scripture . While virtually all Christians take the Bible seriously and hold it to be authoritative in matters of faith and practice , the overwhelming majority do not read the Bible literally , as they would a science textbook . Many of the beloved stories found in the Bible  the Creation , Adam and Eve , Noah and the ark  convey timeless truths about God , human beings , and the proper relationship between Creator and creation expressed in the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation . Religious truth is of a different order from scientific truth . Its purpose is not to convey scientific information but to transform hearts . We the undersigned , Christian clergy from many different traditions , believe that the timeless truths of the Bible and the discoveries of modern science may comfortably coexist . We believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth , one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests . To reject this truth or to treat it as one theory among others is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children . We believe that among Gods good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our Creator . To argue that Gods loving plan of salvation for humanity precludes the full employment of the God-given faculty of reason is to attempt to limit God , an act of hubris . We urge school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge . We ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion , two very different , but complementary , forms of truth . from http : //www.uwosh.edu/colleges/cols/r ... laboration.htm Over 10,000 signatures of Christian Clergy have been collected , and have endorsed this letter ."

"The enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people . Rights Retained by the People Aside from contending that a bill of rights was unnecessary , the Federalists responded to those opposing ratification of the Constitution because of the lack of a declaration of fundamental rights by arguing that inasmuch as it would be impossible to list all rights it would be dangerous to list some because there would be those who would seize on the absence of the omitted rights to assert that government was unrestrained as to those . 1 Madison adverted to this argument in presenting his proposed amendments to the House of Representatives . ''It has been objected also against a bill of rights , that , by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power , it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration ; and it might follow by implication , that those rights which were not singled out , were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government , and were consequently insecure . This is one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard against the admission of a bill of rights into this system ; but , I conceive , that it may be guarded against . I have attempted it , as gentlemen may see by turning to the last clause of the fourth resolution . '' 2 It is clear from its text and from Madison 's statement that the Amendment states but a rule of construction , making clear that a Bill of Rights might not by implication be taken to increase the powers of the national government in areas not enumerated , and that it does not contain within itself any guarantee of a right or a proscription of an infringement . 3 Recently , however , the Amendment has been construed to be positive affirmation of the existence of rights which are not enumerated but which are nonetheless protected by other provisions ."

"WASHINGTON & # 8211 ; Supreme Court aspirant Sonia Sotomayor said Tuesday that she considers the question of abortion rights is settled precedent and says there is a constitutional right to privacy . The federal appeals court judge was asked at her confirmation hearing Tuesday to state how she felt about the landmark Roe versus Wade ruling legalizing abortion in 1973 . Sotomayor told the Senate Judiciary Committee that `` there is a right of privacy . The court has found it in various places in the Constitution . '' She said this right is stated in the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure and in the 14th Amendment guaranteeing equal protection of the law . She declined to say pointblank if she agreed with the high court 's precedent on this volatile issue . Answering a question later from Sen. Orrin Hatch , R-Utah , Sotomayor said that `` all precedents of the Supreme Court I consider settled law , '' subject to the possibility of subsequent reversal , such as when the court last month renounced a previous precedent in a reverse discrimination case . It ruled 5-4 on the side of white firefighters from New Haven , Conn. , who challenged a decision by the city to discard the results of an employee test in which they fared better than minorities who took the examination ."

It takes extraordinary intellectual dishonesty to pretend there is some `` agenda '' at work . These decisions are the consequence of two things : our long history of rationally applying those silly words about equality that folks smarter than this generation of politicians put in the Constitution AND a long-term correction of the misunderstandings of what homosexuality IS and what its consequences are .

"Creationism attempts to deny observable reality with the power of faith , while maintaining a logical façade . The only way to do this is to never follow any point through to it 's ultimate conclusion , as it will be shown as false . Instead , the best tactic is to attempt to bury opponents under an ever-shifting , ever-repeating argument in an attempt to persuade them that because you have so many arguments , you must be right - and because you never stay on-topic , none of your points are ever completely wiped of the map , so you can revisit them and force them to be debated from the start again . This is why the Index to Creationist Claims is so handy , because it allows most arguments to be wiped out from stage one . Hence my personal Creationist Challenge - if someone can come up with an argument for creationism that I can not answer with a single link to the Index , I will take that person seriously . But yes , the above could apply to anyone who is 'blatantly wrong ' ( to put it tactlessly ) ."

"A large fraction of the noncoding part of a eukaryotic genome is used to make RNA that is sufficiently stable in a cell to be detected by different technological approaches ( 14 ) . The biological significance of this pervasive transcription is unclear and controversial . One possibility is that only very short regions of such unannotated RNA are biologically relevant ( 5 ) . In-depth characterization of RNAs as to their subcellular compartmentalization , size , modifications , and genomic origins can potentially provide clues to their functions . This study reports two general observations derived from the maps of nuclear and cytosolic polyadenylated [ poly ( A ) + ] RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides ( nt ) ( long RNAs , lRNAs ) and whole-cell RNAs less than 200 nt ( short RNAs , sRNAs ) over the entire nonrepetitive portion of the human genome . First , the potential biological function of an appreciable portion of long unannotated transcripts is to serve as precursors for sRNAs . Second , these maps reveal three classes of RNAs that have specific genomic localization at gene boundaries . Biological relevance of these classes of RNAs is supported by strong correlation with the expression state of genes they associate with , as well as their syntenic conservation between human and mouse ."

"The church is unfit to rule on abortion because it acts on what benefits them or they 're ideas . Like what I quoted , saying that `` Thou shalt not kill .

The church seems to decide when it will follow it 's rules , and when not . Yes , war is sometimes a neccessary method of self defense , but the many of the Crusades were not neccessary . Most of them were failures , but Christianity is still the second biggest religion in the world ( if not the first ) . The church ca n't be allowed to rule on abortion when they disregard their own laws . Like the above quote , why is the church trying to stop abortion when they would consider one to be alive after taking a breath . if you were to look at it from a scientific standpoint , the individual ovum and sperm are living cells , but they die all the time and no one cares . An embryo or fetus is something starting to develop into a human and that ca n't be stopped without killing it or injecting differnt DNA , but it 's still not too different from sperm and ovum .

"CHICAGO  Observed in the wild and tested in captivity , chimpanzees invite comparison with humans , their close relatives . They bear a family resemblance that fascinates people , and scientists see increasing evidence of similarities in chimp behavior and skills , making some of them think on the vagaries of evolution . For some time , paleontologists and evolutionary biologists have known that chimp ancestors were the last line of todays apes to diverge from the branch that led to humans , probably six million , maybe four million years ago . More recent examination shows that despite profound differences in the two species , just a 1.23 percent difference in their genes separates Homo sapiens from chimpanzees , Pan troglodytes . And certain similarities between the two species , scientists say , go beyond expressive faces and opposable thumbs . Chimps display a remarkable range of behavior and talent . They make and use simple tools , hunt in groups and engage in aggressive , violent acts . They are social creatures that appear to be capable of empathy , altruism , self-awareness , cooperation in problem solving and learning through example and experience . Chimps even outperform humans in some memory tasks ."

"No Electrolyte , science lies ! here is the undisputed truth : Noah and his three sons traveled the globe , collected two representatives of each species ( or seven of each clean species depending on the chapter ) .

The ark floated about like a cork for 40 days , etc whereupon the cargo was released to repopulate the world to present population levels . Meanwhile , there must have been provisions on the Ark for marine animals and fish as the rainwater would have undoubtedly altered the water pH and saline content . Also not mentioned is the fact that Noah and sons must have collected seeds from every PLANT on earth because I am personally not aware of many plant types that can survive completely submerged for 40 days .

"A PRACTICAL MAN 'S PROOF OF GOD The existence of God is a subject that has occupied schools of philosophy and theology for thousands of years . Most of the time , these debates have revolved around all kinds of assumptions and definitions . Philosophers will spend a lifetime arguing about the meaning of a word and never really get there . One is reminded of the college student who was asked how his philosophy class was going . He replied that they had not done much because when the teacher tried to call roll , the kids kept arguing about whether they existed or not . Most of us who live and work in the real world do not concern ourselves with such activities . We realize that such discussions may have value and interest in the academic world , but the stress and pressure of day-to-day life forces us to deal with a very pragmatic way of making decisions . If I ask you to prove to me that you have $ 2.00 , you would show it to me . Even in more abstract things we use common sense and practical reasoning . If I ask you whether a certain person is honest or not , you do not flood the air with dissertations on the relative nature of honesty ; you would give me evidence one way or the other . The techniques of much of the philosophical arguments that go on would eliminate most of engineering and technology if they were applied in those fields . The purpose of this brief study is to offer a logical , practical , pragmatic proof of the existence of God from a purely scientific perspective . To do this , we are assuming that we exist , that there is reality , and that the matter of which we are made is real . If you do not believe that you exist , you have bigger problems than this study will entail and you will have to look elsewhere . THE BEGINNING If we do exist , there are only two possible explanations as to how our existence came to be . Either we had a beginning or we did not have a beginning . The Bible says , `` In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth '' ( Genesis 1 :1 ) . The atheist has always maintained that there was no beginning . The idea is that matter has always existed in the form of either matter or energy ; and all that has happened is that matter has been changed from form to form , but it has always been . The Humanist Manifesto says , `` Matter is self-existing and not created , '' and that is a concise statement of the atheist 's belief . The way we decide whether the atheist is correct or not is to see what science has discovered about this question . The picture below on the left represents our part of the cosmos . Each of the disk shaped objects is a galaxy like our Milky Way . All of these galaxies are moving relative to each other . Their movement has a very distinct pattern which causes the distance between the galaxies to get greater with every passing day . If we had three galaxies located at positions A , B. and C in the second diagram below , and if they are located as shown , tomorrow they will be further apart . The triangle they form will be bigger . The day after tomorrow the triangle will be bigger yet . We live in an expanding universe that gets bigger and bigger and bigger with every passing day . Now let us suppose that we made time run backwards ! If we are located at a certain distance today , then yesterday we were closer together . The day before that , we were still closer . Ultimately , where must all the galaxies have been ? At a point ! At the beginning ! At what scientists call a singularity ! A second proof is seen in the energy sources that fuel the cosmos . The picture to the right is a picture of the sun . Like all stars , the sun generates its energy by a nuclear process known as thermonuclear fusion . Every second that passes , the sun compresses 564 million tons of hydrogen into 560 million tons of helium with 4 million tons of matter released as energy . In spite of that tremendous consumption of fuel , the sun has only used up 2 % of the hydrogen it had the day it came into existence . This incredible furnace is not a process confined to the sun . Every star in the sky generates its energy in the same way . Throughout the cosmos there are 25 quintillion stars [ a meaningless number , given that only some of the universe is visible ] , each converting hydrogen into helium , thereby reducing the total amount of hydrogen in the cosmos . Just think about it ! If everywhere in the cosmos hydrogen is being consumed and if the process has been going on forever , how much hydrogen should be left ? Suppose I attempt to drive my automobile without putting any more gas ( fuel ) into it . As I drive and drive , what is eventually going to happen ? I am going to run out of gas I If the cosmos has been here forever , we would have run out of hydrogen long ago ! The fact is , however , that the sun still has 98 % of its original hydrogen . The fact is that hydrogen is the most abundant material in the universe ! Everywhere we look in space we can see the hydrogen 21 cm line in the spectrum_a piece of light only given off by hydrogen . This could not be unless we had a beginning ! A third scientific proof that the atheist is wrong is seen in the second law of thermodynamics . [ Oh , Christ , not this one again ] In any closed system , things tend to become disordered . If an automobile is driven for years and years without repair , for example , it will become so disordered that it would not run any more . Getting old is simple conformity to the second law of thermodynamics . In space , things also get old . Astronomers refer to the aging process as heat death . If the cosmos is `` everything that ever was or is or ever will be , '' as Dr. Carl Sagan is so fond of saying , nothing could be added to it to improve its order or repair it . Even a universe that expands and collapses and expands again forever would die because it would lose light and heat each time it expanded and rebounded . The atheist 's assertion that matter/energy is eternal is scientifically wrong . The biblical assertion that there was a beginning is scientifically correct . THE CAUSE If we know the creation has a beginning , we are faced with another logical question_was the creation caused or was it not caused ? The Bible states , `` In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth . '' Not only does the Bible maintain that there was a cause_a creation_but it also tells us what the cause was . It was God . The atheist tells us that `` matter is self-existing and not created . '' If matter had a beginning and yet was uncaused , one must logically maintain that something would have had to come into existence out of nothing . From empty space with no force , no matter , no energy , and no intelligence , matter would have to become existent . Even if this could happen by some strange new process unknown to science today , there is a logical problem . In order for matter to come out of nothing , all of our scientific laws dealing with the conservation of matter/energy would have to be wrong , invalidating all of chemistry [ Physics , XXXXX ] . All of our laws of conservation of angular momentum would have to be wrong , invalidating all of physics . All of our laws of conservation of electric charge would have to be wrong , invalidating all of electronics and demanding that your TV set not work ! ! Your television set may not work , but that is not the reason ! In order to believe matter is uncaused , one has to discard known laws and principles of science . No reasonable person is going to do this simply to maintain a personal atheistic position . The atheist 's assertion that matter is eternal is wrong . The atheist 's assertion that the universe is uncaused and selfexisting is also incorrect . The Bible 's assertion that there was a beginning which was caused is supported strongly by the available scientific evidence . THE DESIGN If we know that the creation had a beginning and we know that the beginning was caused , there is one last question for us to answer -- what was the cause ? The Bible tells us that God was the cause . We are further told that the God who did the causing did so with planning and reason and logic . Romans 1:20 tells us that we can know God is `` through the things he has made . '' The atheist , on the other hand , will try to convince us that we are the product of chance . Julian Huxley once said : We are as much a product of blind forces as is the falling of a stone to earth or the ebb and flow of the tides . We have just happened , and man was made flesh by a long series of singularly beneficial accidents. The subject of design has been one that has been explored in many different ways . For most of us , simply looking at our newborn child is enough to rule out chance . There are Modern-day scientists like Paul Davies and Frederick Hoyle , and others , that are raising elaborate objections to the use of chance in explaining natural phenomena . A principle of modern science has emerged in the 1980s called `` the anthropic principle . '' The basic thrust of the anthropic principle is that chance is simply not a valid mechanism to explain the atom or life . If chance is not valid , we are constrained to reject Huxley 's claim and to realize that we are the product of an intelligent God . THE NEXT STEP We have seen a practical proof of God 's existence in this brief study . A flood of questions arise at this point . Which God are we talking about ? Where did God come from ? Why did God create us ? How did God create us ? All of these and many more are answered in the same way_by looking at the evidence in a practical , common sense way . If you are interested in pursuing these things in more detail , we invite you to contact us .

You say that my moral code is a code that puts faith only in myself . That is not true . I very openly acknowledge that if I never had input from the outside - moral codes which were presented to me with the reasons behind them - then my moral code as determined solely by myself would have been meager indeed . I have had a wide range of influences which have helped determined my moral code :

"The problem here is that Christians ( such as I am ) consider the Bible to be Proof . I would be interested in seeing where you get your statistics that most births are impossible and most end in c-section . The women 's body begins preparing for birth from the minute she becomes pregnant . There are hormones released that allow for the cartilage to soften which allows the pelvis to spread as the child is born . Yes , birth is hard on the woman 's body , but personal responsibility comes into play . You did the deed , you do n't punish another for it . I am honestly torn on this one . Though I can see where it would be almost impossible for a woman to live with this , much less have a child that comes from this foul deed , I still do n't see where the child is to blame for the rape , thus it should not be punished . Much used and abused argument . Ca n't really be proven or disproven until it is tested , so I am not sure there is an argument . This is dramaticized by Hollywood leftists in movies and TV , so it has become this seemingly powerful point . Still not seeing where millions of children should be punished for the likely much fewer women who will seek abortion if it is made illegal . I would rather they overscreen than underscreen . I agree . I do not agree this means kill more babies . That is about as humanistic as you can get ( besides killing handicapped children ) . It all leads into a big , black hole . Religion influences all laws . Without that influence , there would be no laws . Note : humanism is also a religion !"

So while convincing evidence might appear once , it 's unlikely to appear again . This does n't automatically mean that the supernatural is n't real , or that the original evidence is bogus . It does mean that scientific methods are n't necessarily the right tools to use to judge the supernatural . Science deals with laws , with constants .

Rather than bring into this peripheral thoughts to the question , such as rights and legal issues ( which are discussed at length here already in other threads ) , I 'd love to hear straightforward relelvant answers to this .

One generation of fruit flies = around a day . Fruit flies were exposed to x rays to speed up mutation rates , we have observed the equivalent of millions of years ( in terms of human generations ) of super-accelerated mutation and ... . no new body parts . Evolutionists will also list in steps how a new body part can arise . This is only plausible if each of those steps could be directly observed . If not , then it is nothing more than science fiction . Evolutionists have been searching for any direct evidence of the theory of evolution since the 1800 's . They are still looking ."

"Yes . I already explained that . An hypothesis is made that explains an observation . Then a prediction is made that can only be true if the hypothesis is true .

I know of one case where anole lizards were transplanted to islands where they did n't exist . Based on previous observation of the lizards in their environment , predictions were made about the physiological changes that should be observed . Those changes were observed . Darwin himself noted the changes induced in domestic animals by the intent of breeders . This is now known as artificial selection . Do n't know . Have you tested your hypothesis ? The debate is n't whether , but how much . Is most evolution gradual as Darwin finally decided ? Or do populations tend to remain relatively constant as long as the environment remains constant ( as noted by Darwin in his notebooks ) ? Good questions . You seem to think that science knows all the answers rather than being a process of looking for answers . There is debate because we are still gathering data about very complex processes . That 's how science works . That 's what the debate is about , sharing ideas with each other ."

"This is a statement written by someone who obviously has not read scripture . One of the most astonising `` proofs '' if you will , that the Bible is of supernatural origin , is predictive prophecy . Science can not , as you claim , `` explain '' everything , and it has no natural explanation for the predictions made in scripture . How can science explain through statistical probablity the over 600 prophecies in Biblical writings that have come to pass ? Also , how can it explain how supposedly uneducated people ( uneducated in the ways of modern science ) wrote about astronomy as if they knew about the universe as we do today . How could they have described the hydrological cycle as we have only come to know it recently ? Ecclesiastes 1:6 The wind goes toward the south , And turns around to the north ; The wind whirls about continually , And comes again on its circuit . How did they know that the earth `` hangs on nothing '' when the accepted norm of the day did not even accept that possibility ? Job 26:7 He stretches out the north over empty space ; He hangs the earth on nothing . How did they know that the `` vapors '' of the earth rise to create moisture , that is seeded by lightning with nitrogen and then falls as rain to fertilze the soil ? Jeremiah 10:13 When He utters His voice , There is a multitude of waters in the heavens : And He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth . He makes lightning for the rain , He brings the wind out of His treasuries. Hydrothermal vents [ 4 ] are described in two books of the Bible written before 1400BCmore than 3,000 years before their discovery by science . Genesis 7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noahs life , in the second month , the seventeenth day of the month , on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up , and the windows of heaven were opened . Even though the Bible is not a scientific text book and does n't purport to be , nowhere is it scientifically inaccurate . In addition , many of the scientific ideas you are so impressed with are nothing new to the Bible . It was speaking of these things long before modern science spoke of them . The story goes `` They ( scientists ) are slowly working their way to the mountain 's peak painstakingly measuring and analyzing every step that they take . After many years of research , they finally arrive at the top of the mountain , scale over its leading edge , only to find a group of theologians sitting there with the answers all along . ''"

"Court : Seattle police OK to stun pregnant woman By GENE JOHNSON & # 8232 ; ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER SEATTLE -- Three Seattle police officers were justified when they used a stun gun on a pregnant mother who refused to sign a traffic ticket , a federal appeals court ruled Friday in a case that prompted an incredulous dissent . Malaika Brooks was driving her son to Seattle 's African American Academy in 2004 when she was stopped for doing 32 mph in a school zone . She insisted it was the car in front of her that was speeding , and refused to sign the ticket because she thought she 'd be admitting guilt . Rather than give her the ticket and let her go on her way , the officers decided to arrest her . One reached in , turned off her car and dropped the keys on the floor . Brooks stiffened her arms against the steering wheel and told the officers she was pregnant , but refused to get out , even after they threatened to stun her . The officers - Sgt . Steven Daman , Officer Juan Ornelas and Officer Donald Jones - then stunned her three times , in the thigh , shoulder and neck , and hauled her out of the car , laying her face-down in the street . Brooks gave birth to a healthy baby two months later , but has permanent scars from the Taser . She sued the officers for violating her constitutional rights , and U.S. District Judge Richard Jones allowed the case to continue . He declined to grant the officers immunity for performing their official duties and said Brooks ' rights were clearly violated . But in a 2-1 ruling Friday , a panel of the 9th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed . Judges Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain held that the officers were justified in making an arrest because Brooks was obstructing them and resisting arrest . The use of force was also justified because of the threat Brooks posed , Hall wrote : `` It seems clear that Brooks was not going to be able to harm anyone with her car at a moment 's notice . Nonetheless , some threat she might retrieve the keys and drive off erratically remained , particularly given her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation . '' They also noted that the force used was n't that serious because the Taser was in `` touch '' mode rather than `` dart '' mode , which hurts more . They reversed the lower court 's opinion and held that the officers were entitled to immunity from the lawsuit . The officers ' lawyers , Ted Buck and Karen Cobb , said the officers made the right decision under the circumstances they faced . `` Police officers have to have the ability to compel people to obey their lawful orders , '' Buck said . That 's all the court recognized today . The 9th Circuit just applied the law instead of getting caught up in the otherwise unfortunate factual circumstances . '' The majority 's opinion outraged Judge Marsha Berzon , who called it `` off the wall . '' `` I fail utterly to comprehend how my colleagues are able to conclude that it was objectively reasonable to use any force against Brooks , let alone three activations of a Taser , in response to such a trivial offense , '' she wrote . She argued that under Washington law , the officers had no authority to take Brooks into custody : Failure to sign a traffic infraction is not an arrestable offense , and it 's not illegal to resist an unlawful arrest . Berzon said the majority 's notion that Brooks obstructed officers was so far-fetched that even the officers themselves did n't make that legal argument . To obstruct an officer , one must obstruct the officer 's official duties , and the officers ' only duties in this case were to detain Brooks long enough to identify her , check for warrants , write up the citation and give it to her . Brooks ' failure to sign did not interfere with those duties , she said . Furthermore , Brooks posed no apparent threat , and the officers could not have known how stunning her would affect the fetus , or whether it might prompt premature labor - another reason their actions were inexcusable , Berzon said . Brooks ' lawyer , Eric Zubel , said he would ask the 9th Circuit to rehear the case . `` This is outrageous - that something like this could happen to a pregnant woman , in front of an elementary school , at 8:30 in the morning , to someone who posed no threat whatsoever , '' he said ."
"If one agrees to a discussion without using the Bible as some people insist , then they have set the terms of the debate . In essence these terms are : 1 . Facts are neutral . However , there are no such things as brute facts ; all facts are interpreted . Once the Bible is eliminated in the argument , then the Christians presuppositions are gone , leaving them unable to effectively give an alternate interpretation of the facts . Their opponents then have the upper hand as they still have their presuppositions  see Naturalism , logic and reality ."
"Susan Smith shocked the nation with the murder of her children . She believed her two young boys were an obstacle to remarriage , so she placed them in her car , fastened their seat belts , and drove them into the lake . Smith 's crime was especially obscene because she violated the most fundamental moral obligation of all : the responsibility a mother has for her own children . Yet would n't Susan Smith be exonerated by Thompson 's and McDonagh 's logic ? These children were kidnappers and interlopers , trespassing on Smith 's life , depriving her of liberty . Why not kill them ? Those boys were attacking her . It was self-defense . Last year , a couple in New York was arrested when authorities learned they took a 10-day vacation to Florida and left their young children behind to fend for themselves . If McDonagh 's and Thompson 's arguments work , these parents should be released from jail because they bear no more obligation towards their own children than they do to strangers across town or burglars who break into their house . Those children were invading their privacy , trespassing in their home , stealing their food ."

"Report : Kennedy barred from communion by bishop Nov. 22 , 2009 PROVIDENCE , R.I.  Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas Tobin has banned Rep. Patrick Kennedy from receiving Communion , the central sacrament of the church , in Rhode Island because of the congressman 's support for abortion rights , Kennedy said in a newspaper interview published Sunday . The decision by the outspoken prelate , reported on The Providence Journal 's Web site , significantly escalates a bitter dispute between Tobin , an ultra orthodox bishop , and Kennedy , a son of the nation 's most famous Roman Catholic family . `` The bishop instructed me not to take Communion and said that he has instructed the diocesan priests not to give me Communion , '' Kennedy told the paper in an interview conducted Friday . Kennedy said the bishop had explained the penalty by telling him `` that I am not a good practicing Catholic because of the positions that I 've taken as a public official , '' particularly on abortion .

"Each side tries to support their own worldview . There are two positions , and sides are chosen . It 's human nature . Yes . I can only speak for myself - winning converts is what the Bible suggests , but I do n't believe in doing it in a forceable way . I do n't believe one person / one event wins a convert all at once , it takes a combination of many tiny little steps ( examples ) to win converts . My main reason for posting here is political . I do n't believe it 's possible to have neutrality in government . If church & amp ; state are separated , atheism and state are combined . Atheism almost always equals secular `` progression '' , and Judeo Christianity almost always equals tradition , according to unchanging Biblical morals . The two quickly clash in politics . Also , I do n't believe future generations ( school children ) are having the gaps in godless evolution explained to them clearly enough . I enjoy written debates very much , and I 'm trying to show how evolution can establish atheism in the U.S. government , in violation of the text of the First Amendment and intent of the framers . I believe there has to be a God because I see no compelling evidence that life spontaneously generated from non living chemicals . I was brought up without anyone forcing me what to believe , and went to church occasionally . My church attendance did n't get very regular until my late twenties - about twenty years ago . A few Bible studies , comparing it to the flow of events , the nature of people , my shortcomings , the shortcomings of science etc , convinced me . Though it does n't really say why , the Bible says that is what will happen . See Matthew 7 :13,14 . It 's part of God 's plan . Free will ."

"Some animals do not fall neatly into the categories of being warm or cold-blooded . Bats , for example , are mammals who can not maintain a constant body temperature and cool off when they are not active . Echidnas maintain a range of body temperatures which usually lies between 77 and 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit and have difficulty cooling down . Mole Rats are another group of mammals who are unable to regulate their body temperature , however , since they live underground , the temperature of their environment does not change much . Some warm-blooded animals , such as bears , groundhogs , gophers and bats hibernate during the cold winter . During hibernation these animals live off of stored body fat and can drop their body temperatures by as much as 50 degrees Fahrenheit . The Hawk Moth is an insect which can raise its body temperature well above the temperature of its surroundings when it is flying because of its huge wing muscles which generate heat when in use . Bees are another example of insects that can raise their body temperatures above that of their environment by moving their wings rapidly to generate heat ."

Often abortion supporters convey their message as one of championing the cause of freedom of choice and resistance of the oppression of others values on women . Perhaps this should be posted as a poll but I wonder if this support for `` choice '' remains consistent . Do those who support the choice of abortion also support the choice to bear children ? Do they abhor the imposition of the one child rule on the women of China for example ? The woman 's choice is restricted and the ideals of the government are imposed upon her . Do those here who support the freedom of choice of abortion denounce China 's policies and support the freedom of choice of bearing children ? There are also some areas in India where a person running for an elected office can not have more than two children ( there are obvious implications of this policy on what the makeup of the ruling government will be and how it will institute policy ) . Do those supporting the choice of abortion denounce this policy as a restriction of choice ? Or do environmental and population concerns outweigh and assume more importance than the freedom of choice in the above examples ?

Much research ( not my own , look for research by Robert Denver ) has shown that chemicals in the water produced by predators when feeding on prey , or changing environments in general , activate pathways in the body which in turn lead to increased tail size and differentiation of color . It has nothing to do with the tadpoles `` desire '' to have a larger or redder tail , it is simply a physiological response . The tadpoles have not `` evolved '' during the course of their development , as you assert . An induced phenotype is not heritable , the ability to induce it is . The tadpoles with the red tails will not produce red tailed tadpoles when they are adults . Those with clear tails will not produce clear tailed tadpoles . They will both produce tadpoles that have the ability to make either phenotype . -Justin"

? ? What are you trying to say ?
"Perhaps the most enduring factoid of the gun prohibition movement is that a person with a gun in the home is 43 times as likely to shoot someone in the family as to shoot a criminal . This `` 43 times '' figure is the all-time favorite factoid of the gun-prohibition lobby . It 's not really true , but it does tell us a lot about the gun-prohibition mindset . The source of the 43-to-1 ratio is a study of firearm deaths in Seattle homes , conducted by doctors Arthur L. Kellermann and Donald T. Reay ( `` Protection or Peril ? : An Analysis of Firearm-Related Deaths in the Home , '' New England Journal of Medicine , 1986 ) . Kellerman and Reay totaled up the numbers of firearms murders , suicides , and fatal accidents , and then compared that number to the number of firearm deaths that were classified as justifiable homicides . The ratio of murder , suicide , and accidental death to the justifiable homicides was 43 to 1 . This is what the anti-gun lobbies call `` scientific '' proof that people ( except government employees and security guards ) should not have guns . Of the gun deaths in the home , the vast majority are suicides . In the 43-to-1 figure , suicides account for nearly all the 43 unjustifiable deaths . Counting a gun suicide as part of the increased risk of having a gun in the home is appropriate only if the presence of a gun facilitates a `` successful '' suicide that would not otherwise occur . But most research suggests that guns do not cause suicide . In the book Point Blank : Guns and Violence in America , Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck analyzed suicide data for every America city with a population more than 100,000 , and found no evidence that any form of gun control ( including handgun prohibition ) had an effect on the total suicide rate . Gun control did sometimes reduce gun suicide , but not overall suicide . . But just as many other people who would commit suicide with a gun would use an equally lethal method if guns are unavailable . Many of the people who kill themselves in firearm accidents may also be bent on destruction , regardless of the means . One study of gun-accident victims found that they were `` disproportionately involved in other accidents , violent crime , and heavy drinking . '' ( Philip Cook , `` The Role of Firearms in Violent Crime : An Interpretative Review of the Literature , '' in Criminal Violence ) . Or , as another researcher put it , `` The psychological profile of the accident-prone suggests the same kind of aggressiveness shown by most murderers . '' ( Roger Lane , `` On the Social Meaning of Homicide Trends in America , '' in Violence in America , Vol . I , 1989 . )"

"Modern evolutionary synthesis From Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia  Learn more about using Wikipedia for research  Jump to : navigation , search The modern evolutionary synthesis refers to a set of ideas from several biological specialities that were brought together to form a unified theory of evolution accepted by the great majority of working biologists . This synthesis was produced over a period of about a decade ( 1936-1947 ) and was closely connected with the development from 1918 to 1932 of the discipline of population genetics , which integrated the theory of natural selection with Mendelian genetics . Julian Huxley invented the term , when he summarised the ideas in his book , Evolution : The Modern Synthesis in 1942 . Though the 'Modern Synthesis ' is the basis of current evolutionary thinking , it refers to a historical event that took place in the 1930s and 1940s . Major figures in the development of the modern synthesis include R. A. Fisher , Theodosius Dobzhansky , J.B.S . Haldane , Sewall Wright , Julian Huxley , Ernst Mayr , Bernhard Rensch , George Gaylord Simpson , and G. Ledyard Stebbins . The modern synthesis solved difficulties and confusions caused by the specialisation and poor communication between biologists in the early years of the twentieth century . Discoveries of early geneticists were difficult to reconcile with gradual evolution and the mechanism of natural selection . The synthesis reconciled the two schools of thought , while providing evidence that studies of populations in the field were crucial to evolutionary theory . It drew together ideas from several branches of biology that had become separated , particularly genetics , cytology , systematics , botany , morphology , ecology and paleontology ."
"Okay , let 's look at evolution ."
OK. That 's probably correct . I did the calculations in cubic kilometers .
"Evolutionists have taught for decades that the second law of thermodynamicsthe entropy principle that things naturally decrease in complexity rather than increaseposes no barrier to evolution . Their claim is that while there is an overall downhill trend in nature , uphill innovations can occur locally in a system if abundant energy is available . Specifically the sun 's energy provides all that is necessary to transform inorganic chemicals into a living cell and eventually into people . All that is necessary is an open system and abundant energy , especially the sun 's energy . If complicated living organisms can be created in this way , certainly something not nearly so complicated as a house could be produced . Especially a solar-powered house !"

In spite of that overwhelming personal and universal evidence , and despite the fact that you pseudo scientists have argued that same point in every single debate on biology we have ever had here regarding simple biological life ."
"At first , the lighter form of this moth was more common than the darker form . This lighter type blended well into the lighter-colored trunks of trees and so was more protected from birds . But then , because of years of pollution from industrial areas , tree trunks became darkened . Now the moths lighter color worked against them , as birds could pick them out faster and eat them . Consequently the darker variety of peppered moth , which is said to be a mutant , survived better because it was difficult for birds to see them against the soot-darkened trees . The darker variety rapidly became the dominant type ."

If you want to attach relgious or philosophical significance to sex you may at this juncture . That is why I think it is wrong . Humanity would n't be around if homosexuality were the standard , homosexuals would n't exist without heterosexuals . You may be looking for a more fundamental `` morality '' to my basis .

"Would someone care to post the `` Cliff Notes '' of ID theory ? The entire theory seems like a non-sequitor to me , at least as presented by our friendly neighborhood ID peddler . In essence , it seems as though the central claim is that nothing `` intelligent '' and no `` information '' can be be created except by a creator , and that the world as we know it could not exist without this information . Further to that , the complexity and `` order '' of the universe is evidence of the work of an intelligent designer . Is that fair enough ? So if nothing intelligent and no information can be created , how did the creator get created ? That 's step one , IMHO , and it would seem to me it all falls apart right there , but I 'm assuming I 'll get some kind of an `` always there '' or other such supernatural explanation . A luxury never afforded to the `` scientist '' side of the debate . As far as `` information '' ( I really do n't like that word anymore ) and complexity are concerned , it comes down to the available scientific explanations vs. `` you 're wrong , the creator did it '' in various forms . In other words , it essentially boils down to an entirely philosophical debate as from what I 've seen so far , it ca n't really be argued on a purely scientific level . Further to that , it would seem to me to be a very tenous position to hold to agree that micro evolution and perhaps speciation can occur , and that the world functions as it does because of `` intelligent design '' , and yet profess belief in a 6000 year old earth . In other words , I ca n't see ID theory , which seems to me to be essentially a form of theistic evolution , being compatible with Young Earth Creationism , or for that matter , with any form of literal Creationism .

"You guys know me . Always happy to correct anyone . As electrolyte pointed out , ( 1 ) the first step in the scientific method is the observation . A scientist observes something that raises a question . ( 2 ) Then comes the hypothesis , that is an attempt to explain the observation . The hypothesis can be an educated guess or even wild speculation based on previous knowledge or intuition , or it may be based in previous science and an understanding of scientific principles . ( 3 ) One then makes a prediction that is a necessary consequence of the hypothesis . That science is predictive is one of its salient characteristics . In the case of the scientific method , the prediction is said to have the power to falsify the hypothesis . In other words , if the prediction can be shown to be false , then the hypothesis must also be false . If the prediction is true , then the hypothesis is supported . So now we have the observation , the hypothesis that explains the observation , and a prediction that is a consequence of the hypothesis . The next step ( 4 ) is to design an experiment to test the prediction , and then ( 5 ) to perform the test . If the prediction fails the test , then it may be abandoned . However , as electrolyte pointed out , the process may be circular , because if the prediction is falsified , additional observation from the test may be used to adjust the hypothesis at ( 2 ) , and a new prediction is made at ( 3 ) , and so on . In creation science , the process stops at ( 2 ) , except that the hypothesis is based on dogma and scripture , not reality ."

"What is science ? The first place to start is with a definition of science . Many exist , but most of them come down to something like , If something is scientific , it is observable and testable ( i.e. , able to be repeated ) . Now it might surprise readers without a scientific background to hear me say that very few scientists have any real idea what science is . However , if you are a scientist you will probably acknowledge the truth of this seemingly nonsensical statement . In my undergraduate studies and postgraduate research , I cant ever recall anyone telling me what science is ( and isnt ! ) , showing me what it is , or providing me with an explanation of how it operates . If you are studying science or working with scientists and you doubt me , I challenge you to ask them for a definition of what is scientific. After a pause , most of them would not be able to give an answer much deeper than It is what scientists do. As an undergraduate , I was taught to remember , not to think . Sure , I was given tools which I could use to think , but I wasnt actually taught to think . Then , as a Ph.D. researcher I worked in a very narrow field ( as do all Ph.D. researchers ) , and so the breadth of a question like What is the definition of scientific ?  was absolutely irrelevant to me . Upon graduation and working as a research scientist for 17 years and as a leader of other scientists , the question has never arisen , nor apparently needed to have been asked . My point is that most scientists dont really know what is or isnt scientific , because it rarely affects what they do . Why make a big deal of this ? The reason is because creation and evolution are actually both outside the realms of science and , to know this , you need to know what science isand as we have seen , most scientists dont . Neither process is currently observable , testable or repeatable . Please note that when speaking of evolution , I am talking of the appearance of new ( not rearranged ) genetic information leading to greater and greater complexity of genetic information . I am also talking about the appearance of life starting from inanimate chemicals . When talking about evolution , I am not speaking of natural selection , which leads to a reduction in genetic information in those species . Creationists , of course , have not the slightest problem with natural selection . After all , it has been practiced by farmers for centuries in their breeding of plants and animals through selecting preferred offspring and mating or propagating these . Anyway , the theory of natural selection was described by creation-believing scientists long before Darwin boarded the Beagle ."

Stellar and Planetary Evolution : origin of stars and planets
"Evolution does not prove or disprove anything . It offers an explanation of why things are as they are , and is considered by far the most likely explanation of the explanations available . This is ever the way of science : observe what is around you and try to find an explanation , then verify if the explanation holds true . This is also the reason why these debates still exist : because they are waged in the wrong direction . `` Prove evolution ! '' `` No you prove creation ! Prove god ! '' `` No , you disprove god ! '' leads nowhere . We 're looking at the world , and wonder what makes it tick because we are naturally curious ( according to evolutionists , probably because apes curious about `` what is making that tall grass sway when there is no wind '' got to live longer , the longer life being spent on having more . According to creationist , because god made us so . ) . Understanding the world is generally useful , since we get creative ideas about how to keep it as it is when we like it or how to change it when we do n't like it . Possible explanations pop up all the time and as they are mutually exclusive , we usually try to see which one is more likely . None can ever be proven true . For all we know , god may indeed have created the world 6000 years ago and then spend an enormous amount of effort to make it look waaay older . Of course , such a god either has a great sense of ( I tremble at thinking about what his idea of a practical joke might be ) or is a rather individual . Or dividual , no one ever explained how god/s might procreate ."

"The theory of aggregated production , which is the point of the following book , nevertheless can be much easier adapted to the conditions of a totalitarian state [ eines totalen Staates ] than the theory of production and distribution of a given production put forth under conditions of free competition and a large degree of laissez-faire .

Since it is based on fewer hypotheses than the orthodox theory , it can accommodate itself all the easier to a wider field of varying conditions . Although I have , after all , worked it out with a view to the conditions prevailing in the Anglo-Saxon countries where a large degree of laissez-faire still prevails , nevertheless it remains applicable to situations in which state management is more pronounced . For the theory of psychological laws which bring consumption and saving into relationship with each other , the influence of loan expenditures on prices , and real wages , the role played by the rate of interestall these basic ideas also remain under such conditions necessary parts of our plan of thought ."

"The Supreme Sovereign ordered the water god Gong Gong to create a flood as punishment and warning for human misbehavior . Gong Gong extended the flood for 22 years , and people had to live in high mountain caves and in trees , fighting with wild animals for scarce resources . Unable to persuade the Supreme Sovereign to stop the flood , and told by an owl and a turkey about _Xirang_ or Growing Soil , the supernatural hero Gun stole Growing Soil from heaven to dam the waters . Before Gun was finished , however , the Supreme Sovereign sent the fire god Zhu Rong to execute him for his theft . The Growing Soil was taken back to heaven , and the floods continued . However , Gun 's body did n't decay , and when it was cut apart three years later , his son Yu emerged in the form of a horned dragon . Gun 's body also transformed into a dragon at that time and thenceforth lived quietly in the deeps . The Supreme Sovereign was fearful of Yu 's power , so he cooperated and gave Yu the Growing Soil and the use of the dragon Ying . Yu led other gods to drive away Gong Gong , distributed the Growing Soil to remove most of the flood , and led the people to fashion rivers from Ying 's tracks and thus channel the remaining floodwaters to the sea .

"Guidance by humans in the blind Watchmaker does not stop it being a reasonable analogy for his idea that no higher intelligence is in evolution but it can produce .

I will show you You could describe electrons as things that hate other electrons but like positive charges . If some electrons see other electrons coming at them down a wire they will also move down the wire to avoid them . If it means going through a circuit an powering a light globe to do the electrons will still flow if the circuit is complete . Now lets think about whats happening , each indivual electron hates large group of electrons coming towards it but to get out of the way it will have to get closer to other electrons ( those punks ) . So if you increased the cross sectional area of the wire then the resistance will decrease . What about a double adaptor ? All it does is let the current go through two different circuits . Now if there are two light globes will they both glow half as bright ? No . Why because the resistance is halved and there will be twice as much total electron flow . A lot of laws in electric circuit theory made sense to me when I imagined I was an electron going through a wire and how happy I would be going down a wire . Electrons are not happy but I still had an analogy that gave me answers so I was happy . I would have been better off being told that voltage is joules per coloumb so the voltage drop between circuits must be the same ."

"So , I could certainly see , if variation was truly random that selection could theoretically pick from a pool of random variants . Unfortunately for evolutionists , the concept of randomness when it comes to new traits has never actually been proven . In fact , whenever animals experience an environmental shift , they have this bad habit of shifting right along with it , starting with an internal response from each creature who somehow `` senses '' this change . It 's hardly logical to call this random . But if each individual of a population experiences the same environmental cue , and each member simultaneously evolves the same traits epigenetically , not only will this speed up evolution exponentially , but it will also give each member the same traits at the same time -- which ultimately gives them the same basic fitness -- -- - which undermines natural selection , making mortality/breeding success mostly a lottery of circumstance , with a little sexual selection thrown in ."

What did Jesus have to say about the issue of abortion ?
"Society 's willingness to impose on women alone the sacrifice required by laws restricting abortion , unique within the landscape of Anglo-American law , may well reflect a deeply held traditional view of the differences in character of the sexes . While we might not impose selflessness and virtuous behavior on a man ... .some may find it less of a contradiction to impose such virtue on a woman because of the traditional view of her nature . But to impose virtue on ANY person demeans that person 's individual worth . It is no more acceptable when the person is a woman than a man . There should be no 'woman 's exception ' to our traditional regard for individualism and autonomy . As long as these values remain at the core of our legal system , there is thus a powerful case for the conclusion that laws prohibiting abortion -- even IF the fetus is regarded as a person -- deny women the equal protection of the laws guaranteed to all by the 14th amendment . And if this is so , then perhaps the Roe decision , by gratuitously insisting that the fetus can not be deemed a person , needlessly insulted and alienated those for whom the view that the fetus is a person represents a fundamental article of faith or a bedrock personal committment . Perhaps as Yale Law School Dean Guido Calabresi has suggested , the Roe opinion for no good reason said to a large and politically active group `` [ y ] our metaphysics are not part of our Constitution . '' The Court could have indeed have said : Even if the fetus is a person , our Constitution forbids compelling a woman to carry it for nine months and become a mother"

"It sure is funny how many times the `` pro-lifers '' claim a victory- and yet that victory is quickly overturned by the supreme authority in this country- which is not the senate , not the president , it is the COURT . I find it truly insulting that this great nation , which was founded upon the idea of religious freedom has allowed so many of its laws to be affected by the over-dominant christian right . If we put aside the bible , the commandments , and the intentionally biased commentaries of christian leaders , what argument is left ? The Christian right will say that all life is precious , but obviously there are tiers . An unborn , unwanted , and even sometimes malformed child is more precious than that of the mother . Who cares if she was raped ? Who cares if she was the victim of incest ? Who cares if the child she carries has tested positive for all sorts of defects- `` My preacher says it 's wrong ! '' Another disturbing all too common event is that of the woman who has taken her prescribed birth control , but it failed , so she finds herself carrying a child she never wanted , and even worse , as a result of the augmented hormone levels as a result of birth control , her child has little chance of being born normal and healthy . But if these `` pro-lifers '' have their way , she will be forced to have the child , and raise it . Another argument I often hear is the option of adoption . One must wonder , though , if adoptive families were so abundant , why so many group homes for unwanted children who are doomed to live out their childhoods at the knees of the state ? The gross majority of open-adoption agencies out there are christian-founded , which means of course , that unless you adhere to their strict guidelines , you will not recieve a child . Single parents ( no matter the income ) homosexuals , any person who does not subscribe to christianity is immediately disqualified ! What I really want to say is , If you have some moral objection to abortion , that 's just fine~ then never have one yourself . But please do not expect another person to conform to your ideas . Why should they ?"

"GEOLOGY : The Calibration of Ediacaran Time Alan J. Kaufman* More than a century ago , the last great geological period was formally ratified by an international committee . This was the final rocky step in the subdivision of deep time based on the evolutionary progression of animal fossils . However , recent years have seen the identification of an older and tumultuous new interval , the Ediacaran Period , during which Earth 's earliest soft-bodied organisms emerged in the oceans . This interval was recently ratified ( 1 ) , underscoring advances in the absolute dating ( 2-6 ) and worldwide correlation of geological strata that were deposited in isolated basins before true animals exploded onto the scene in the succeeding Cambrian Period . On page 95 of this issue , Condon et al . ( 7 ) present precise age constraints for the Ediacaran Period . The authors have analyzed volcanic dust in two key depositional layers in the Doushantuo Formation of southern China . Their radiometric dates provide important insights into the rates of geological and evolutionary processes . The first layer , with an age of about 635 million years , is at the base of the new interval , whereas the second , at about 550 million years , may constrain the age of an environmental disaster ( 8-10 ) that is closely associated with the rapid diversification of the Ediacara biota ( see the figure ) that lend their name to the new Period . http : //www.sciencemag.org/content/vo ... m/59-1-med.gif Figure 1 Early animals ?

In contrast , the beginning of the Ediacaran period is defined by the base of a marine carbonate rock , which formed in southern Australia in the aftermath of a distinctive and potentially global ice age ( 11 , 12 ) . Equivalent glacial rocks occur immediately beneath similar carbonates at the base of the Doushantuo Formation . In the area studied by Condon et al. , the new ages constrain the Doushantuo Formation , which represents most of the Ediacaran Period , to some 85 million years -- a remarkably long interval for only about 100 m of rock . This observation begs the question : How much time may be missing in Ediacaran strata from southern China ? In the absence of dates between the two radiometric tie points , one must consider two possibilities : Either the sediments accumulated continuously , albeit slowly ( some two orders of magnitude more slowly than in similar environments of the same age ) , or there are breaks in time ( hiatuses or unconformities ) hidden within the poorly exposed layers . On the basis of limited physical data , Condon et al . suggest the presence of two such unconformities in their study area near the Yangtze Gorges . The duration of these stratigraphic breaks with respect to the environmental anomaly -- reflecting a dramatic change in the cycling of carbon on Earth 's surface -- and subsequent biological innovations form the cornerstone of their conclusions , and deserve closer examination . Spectacular fossil animal embryos ( 13 , 14 ) of great evolutionary importance are found at Weng'an ( some 375 km to the southwest of the authors ' study area ) , where the Doushantuo Formation accumulated closer to the shoreline and records only a single surface of unconformity . In such nearshore environments , oceanic sediments are often exposed above sea level , resulting in the removal of underlying sediments and hence the erasure of some fraction of geological time . Which of the two hiatal surfaces from the deeper-water sections at the Yangtze Gorges correlates to the single unconformity at Weng'an ? The data are more equivocal than presented by Condon et al. , and the choice carries important evolutionary consequences . At the Yangtze Gorges , the extraordinary carbon cycle anomaly recorded in marine carbonates near the top of the Doushanto Formation is truncated by the uppermost unconformity . Condon et al . suggest that there is little time missing across the surface , thereby preserving a causal relation between the environmental perturbation and the rapid diversification of Ediacara organisms and associated faunas around 550 million years ago . However , correlation of this surface and the intervening sediments back to Weng'an tells another story . At Weng'an , both the carbon cycle anomaly and the sediments typical of the uppermost Doushantuo Formation at the Yangtze Gorges are missing , implying a substantial hiatus . Comparison of broadly equivalent strata in southern Australia and the western United States suggests a stratigraphic architecture similar to that in southern China , where similar carbon cycle anomalies are truncated by unconformities ( 15 ) . In the western United States , the post-anomaly unconformity removes a minimum of 130 m of section , more than the entire thickness of the Doushantuo Formation . These observations suggest that the unconformity separating the Ediacaran faunas and the carbon cycle anomaly in southern China may , in fact , hide a lot of time , thereby decoupling the environmental and biological events that the authors wish to connect . This is not meant to detract from the important radiometric calibration that Condon et al . provide , but rather to note that the stratigraphic relations between these dates , and therefore their connection to evolutionary events , are far from straightforward . According to Condon et al. , the rapid diversification of complex multicellular organisms in Ediacaran oceans forced the carbon cycle anomaly seen worldwide , but this seems possible only if there is no real time missing across the upper Doushantuo unconformity . If this is not the case , then this interpretation may be placing the cart before the horse . Alternative models suggest that environmental changes may have driven evolutionary transformations . In particular , atmospheric oxygen -- long believed to be an external forcing factor to evolution -- appears to have built up rapidly during the Ediacaran Period , not because of a discrete biological event but as a result of the tectonic forces that lift and erode mountain ranges ( 16 ) . Through precise radiometric clocks and clever stratigraphic connections , geoscientists can increasingly correlate Ediacaran sediments that are separated widely in space and time . These tools allow us to piece together a complex puzzle of unforgettable biological events against a background of repetitive climatic and environmental perturbations . However , even with exact dates , the cyclicity of these events and the specter of a fragmentary rock record add uncertainty to our picture of Ediacaran Earth history . References 1 . A. H.

"HUNTSVILLE , AL  Jesus Christ , son of God and noted pro-life activist , killed two and critically wounded seven others when He opened fire in the waiting room of a Huntsville abortion clinic Tuesday . Security guards at the Women 's Medical Clinic of Huntsville were able to disarm the Messiah before He could reload His weapon , a secondhand Glock 9mm pistol that authorities said He purchased legally at a Jackson , MS , sporting-goods store . `` Abortion is a sin , '' said Christ as He was led away in handcuffs . `` It is an abomination in the eyes of Me . '' Witnesses said the attack , which took the lives of Dr. Nelson Woodring , 51 , and clinic nurse Danielle Costa , 29 , came from `` out of nowhere . '' `` He walked up to the admissions desk and asked if He could see Dr. Woodring , '' receptionist Iris Reid said . `` The next thing I knew , He was shouting Biblical verses and opening fire on everything moving . '' `` It was horrible , '' said injured clinic nurse Jessica Combs , recovering at a local hospital with bullet wounds to the leg and abdomen . `` He put his hands over Dr. Woodring 's head and told him He forgave him for his sins , and then He shot him right in the face . '' Huntsville police officials are not certain how the Messiah was able to bypass clinic guards and proceed undetected past security cameras and into the clinic waiting room , where He produced the gun from its hiding place in the folds of His robe . Federal investigators are similarly baffled , saying that the heavily armed Christ had moved in `` mysterious ways . '' Speaking to reporters from His holding cell , Christ , 33 , said He had `` no regrets '' about what He had done . `` As I said in John 16:21 , every life is precious , '' Christ said . `` This means every life , not just those who have already been born . My father , the Lord , feels the same way I do . In Jeremiah 1:5 , He said unto the prophet Jeremiah , 'Before I formed you in the womb I knew you , before you were born I set you apart . ' The unborn fetus is a sacred , living creation of my Father in Heaven and should be treated as such . '' Added Christ : `` What if the Virgin Mary had decided to abort me ? Certainly she must have been tempted to do so . After all , it was n't even her decision to conceive me in the first place . But in the end , she made the right decision , bringing her pregnancy to term and giving the world a Savior . Blessed is she among women . '' According to legal experts , if convicted , Christ could face the death penalty ."

"Human beings only have two ways to deal with one another : reason and force . If you want me to do something for you , you have a choice of either convincing me via argument , or force me to do your bidding under threat of force . Every human interaction falls into one of those two categories , without exception . Reason or force , that 's it . In a truly moral and civilized society , people exclusively interact through persuasion . Force has no place as a valid method of social interaction , and the only thing that removes force from the menu is the personal firearm , as paradoxical as it may sound to some . When I carry a gun , you can not deal with me by force . You have to use reason and try to persuade me , because I have a way to negate your threat or employment of force . The gun is the only personal weapon that puts a 100-pound woman on equal footing with a 220-pound mugger , a 75-year old retiree on equal footing with a 19-year old gangbanger , and a single gay guy on equal footing with a carload of drunk guys with baseball bats . The gun removes the disparity in physical strength , size , or numbers between a potential attacker and a defender . There are plenty of people who consider the gun as the source of bad force equations . These are the people who think that we 'd be more civilized if all guns were removed from society , because a firearm makes it easier for a mugger to do his job . That , of course , is only true if the mugger 's potential victims are mostly disarmed either by choice or by legislative fiat -- it has no validity when most of a mugger 's potential marks are armed . People who argue for the banning of arms ask for automatic rule by the young , the strong , and the many , and that 's the exact opposite of a civilized society . A mugger , even an armed one , can only make a successful living in a society where the state has granted him a force monopoly . Then there 's the argument that the gun makes confrontations lethal that otherwise would only result in injury . This argument is fallacious in several ways . Without guns involved , confrontations are won by the physically superior party inflicting overwhelming injury on the loser . People who think that fists , bats , sticks , or stones do n't constitute lethal force watch too much TV , where people take beatings and come out of it with a bloody lip at worst . The fact that the gun makes lethal force easier works solely in favor of the weaker defender , not the stronger attacker . If both are armed , the field is level . The gun is the only weapon that 's as lethal in the hands of an octogenarian as it is in the hands of a weightlifter . It simply would n't work as well as a force equalizer if it was n't both lethal and easily employable . When I carry a gun , I do n't do so because I am looking for a fight , but because I 'm looking to be left alone . The gun at my side means that I can not be forced , only persuaded . I do n't carry it because I 'm afraid , but because it enables me to be unafraid . It does n't limit the actions of those who would interact with me through reason , only the actions of those who would do so by force . It removes force from the equation ... and that 's why carrying a gun is a civilized act ."

Thus , because God is the one killing people , the act of killing that would normally be immoral becomes moral .

Does anyone here have knowledge of where I might acquire the supplies necessary to conduct such experiments ?"
