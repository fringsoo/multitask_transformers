By your own admission you havent 'hung out ' with stoners for a while and you 're making generalisations about them to people who do spend a lot of time with stoners ?
Actually , they did n't . The whole tragedy was caused by gun control . If even one student was packing when that occured , 33 lives could have been saved . But no , more victims of botched laws and corrupt politicians .
Not quite . To be more correct regarding government and guns , the right to own weapons is for the right to revolt and revolt with violence . Our political philosophy is very clear on this : `` that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it '' - Declearation of Independace You have the right to try and revolt with violence . You do n't have the right to win a revolt .
At your service : Comparison I could 've just circled the whole thing , but this makes it clearer . Plus it 's overall body shape is `` fatter ''
Well yes .
So which is it : the action is moral , the action is immoral , or there is no answer ? You seem confused .
Exact , to the point , & amp ; beautiful .
True .
based on the idea that people are dispensible , particularly if they obstruct your well-being . a woman would abort her baby because being a mother contradicts her idea of well-being . in the same way we send soldiers to kill the enemy if they are deemed contrary to the well-being of our country can you be against abortion and pro-war ?
This is a pretty touchy issue , and I agree with the different points of view.. most of them make sense ... while I do n't personally agree with abortion , I do n't feel that I have the right to tell someone else what they should do . The way I see it , is that it 's their body , their life , they are the ones who will be affected by their decision . I do n't have to like the choices someone else makes , and I do n't have to agree with it , but while I have that right , I also believe that people should have the right to make those decisions . Are these anti-abortion people going to step in and pay for the cost of having the baby , raising it , etc.. ? ? ? Maybe some of those are the issues people consider when having an abortion . Maybe the woman was raped . I see the point when someone said that the baby should not be punished for that , and I agree with that , but the rape was committed against the woman 's will ... she did n't ask for that to happen , and if a pregnancy results from that , that is also against her will , so why should she feel that she has to have the child ? What does she tell the child when it decides to ask who its father is ? ? The child could still be born and given up for adoption , and that is a good idea , but maybe the woman will relive the rape throughout the pregnancy by being reminded of it on a daily basis ... . all I feel is until it happens to you , and YOU are forced to make these kinds of choices , you should n't judge anyone else for the choices that they make .
Ah , I see . Your reasons are secret reasons . On a debate forum , about gay rights , you oppose it based on ... .well you wo n't say ! Nice debate . Who 's really playing the game here ? I have already listed on a number of posts why it 's not constitutional . Since you missed it ( It 's only the first post in the thread ) For gay coupes right to be married ( Or the same legal status ) 1 . Human rights with regards to legal classifcation and the benefits therein are desired by comitted consenting adults of the same gender . 2 . It 's a contract between two consenting adults . 3 . A contract that does not violate anyone 's legal rights or cause any significant ill effects to the public welfare . It 's unconstitutional to allow one group of people access to marriage rights ( hetero couples only ) , and not allow it to female/female and male/male couples when they are obviously lobbying for it in significant numbers . It 's now a public issue on a significant scale . Of course , maybe if you had a REASON for objecting to gays being treated equally with regards to the rights of marriage , we would understand not only why you are reluctant to back your claim , but why your reason is also not constitutional . You can call it games , I call it justifying my position while pointing out how opponents of gay rights , such as yourself , really ca n't make any reasonable justification for their desire to restrict human rights , other than saying `` well I want to '' ... or in your case ... `` shhh ... it 's a secret '' . You know what WE call it on the debate forum when one side refuses to present or rebut arguments ? Losing the debate . I realize winning and losing..i.e . being right and being wrong are not concepts found in religion , where anything goes ... but out here in the real world actions have consequences , and words ... yes , imagine that , have specific meanings . You verbally support a movement that restricts human rights , yet wo n't give us reasons for your position . I find that appalling . Yet you are content with labeling me as `` playing games '' . How ironic . -Mach
See above
You have to be off for more than 4 days and after that I would get the princely sum of £79.15 per week..hardly worth having . Unlike teachers I can not stay at home and get paid when it snows too .
In other words , you think a Supreme Court decision should only shut down the debate if it 's a decision you agree with . Roe v. Wade and Heller do share some striking similarities . For example , Scalia stated in Heller : `` Nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on long-standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill , or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings , or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms . '' However , the text of the Constitution has as much to say about such restrictions as it does about abortion . I 've heard that Scalia has been criticized for making such a statement because there is no clear historical precedent dating back 200 years of banning felons from owning firearms . So neither the text of the Second Amendment nor tradition justifies such restrictions . It is an example of judicial lawmaking .
Well , that is not what your colleagues quoted herein seem to feel ... and that certainly is not what empirical evidence is bearing out . Evolution simply put , is the creation story for secular humanists and nothing more , which in and among itself if fine - I do n't personally care if believe we evolved from Mountain Dew , but do n't try to pass that off as fact when there is substantial evidence that says otherwise . I am sorry ... you have not made a convinving arguement here ... and I dare say save your breath , you never will .
You 're not one of those people who does n't consider Catholics christians are you ?
Actually he does n't believe in a liar God like you , so really it 's YOU who 's the blasphemer . And he 's a Christian , you 're a Biblist . He actually follows Christ , you just try to maintain the credibility of your God-Book .
um , yeah , you could say that ... ( wo n't argue ... left up to the evolution board )
I 'm not in denial about anything and do n't think Evo 's are stupid because they do n't agree with me . Obiviously , things do n't work both ways .
Because you say so ?
Oh ! mememe ! I have an idea ! The museum staff hire ( or possibly abduct ) a few evolutionists and put them in stocks . The visiting kids then come to the gallery to give Mum and Dad a break for an hour and get to ask the scientists questions about the origin of the earth and why fossils are different from things alive today . Each time an evolutionist gives an answer based on science they get pelted with the leftover veg from the dino pit lunchtime display . This way the kids learn an important lesson in how to deal with scientists as well as being good for the environment by putting all that veg the dinos would n't eat to good use ! Yay !
And yet the species that exist today are the exact same as the species during the high oxygen content ? That makes little sense . It 's like saying the world was vastly different before yet perfectly suited for the species that exist today . That is COMPLETELY nonsensical . Where did all of the oxygen go ?
Well , Google is your friend here - try fossil and see what you get . Alternatively click the link in my sig and look in the archive section at Talk Origins . It is not possible to break fossilisation down into such simple notions as `` one big preservation event '' and lots of `` little preservations '' . If you can think of some examples of fossils then we can examine them more specifically as what can be said about the circumstances of their preservation . I 've been a bit vague here as it is a ) such a broad subject to describe succinctly b ) I 'm tired and c ) I 'm full of cold No doubt someone who is n't under the influence of b ) and/or c ) will chime in as well with more details while I pull round . Now , where was my hankerchief ... ...
What if a 13 year old girl comes up to you and asks for sex , and you agree ? Are you forcing yourself on to her ?
You did n't bother to read the link , I see , which said : `` During the 70-year Babylonian captivity , from 606-537 B.C. , the southern kingdom of Israel , Judah , had lost it 's national sovereignty , but retained it 's tribal staff or national identity.2 It is very significant that in the book of Ezra we read that during the 70-year Babylonian captivity the Jews still retained their own lawgivers or judges.3 The Jews maintained their identity and judicial authority over their own people even during 70 years of slavery . The scepter had not been lost during the Babylonian captivity . ''
Reference please .
So are you saying that the people of India are n't upset about what happened and how the police chose to hide instead of engage the enemy and thus let hundreds of people be violently murdered ? Are you saying that the people of India are n't seeking changes so they can arm themselves accordingly so if something like this happens again they 'll be better prepared to handle it ?
I see you Americans deal as loosely with the French and Spanish languages , as you do with English ! Surely it is something like Viva Libertad , or Vive la Liberte , but Viva La Liberty ? ? ? ? ? Leo
Apparently you thought I was claiming that pro-lifers thought that the baby 's life was more valuable than the mother 's life . So I clarified :
Just to point out , the class that ID is being taught in is a comparative religion class .
That was put nicely . No argument here . Maybe marriage should be taken out and give everyone civil unions . And if you wanted to be considered married it can be your religious ceremony
I think it 's true . Why would someone make that up and pass it off as a real event ? I think the continents probably started separating some time after that , which is how God separated the people .
I believe you 've missed the point . He 's not against evolution ; change of species over time into other species . He in fact , from what I can gather , does indeed believe in evolution He 's arguing that it did n't come about through materialistic processes .

What is your evidence they did n't do this ? Remember , today 's Coelacanth is different .
You mean that the confiscation of the guns would cause civil unrest ? That`s an interesting thought .
Then you freely admit that you lied when you said this , and I quote : People like Arch are setting it as opposed to science and in that position it will be doomed to fail . AND Arch is doing nothing but distorting the very thing he holds so dear , I mean , how is accurately quoting passages from the bible distorting it in any way ? You do nothing but post drivel which makes no factual statements at all . And you call that debating ?
wow , I never thought a qoute would be so stupid as to compare it to a house . Fine then what if I compare your head to a house that is housing ur brain . But it would be perfectly legal to rip it out and steamroll it on the street for allto see . ( by ur rules of course this would be a perfectly acceptable thing to do )
In a way , taking rights away is an American value since we have prescribed methods for doing it . For instance , we have legislatures which posess authority to remove a large number of what you likely consider to be rights . Here are just a small number that come to mind : 1 ) Right to murder 2 ) Right to own slaves 3 ) Right to rape 4 ) Right to abusing children 5 ) Right to vote 6 ) Right to smoke ( if you 're under 18 ) 7 ) Right to drink ( 18th Amendment ) 8 ) Right to engage in certain activities in public 9 ) Right to drive as fast as one wants 10 ) Right to dump dangerous chemicals in the nearest river The list goes on really . The fact is that you do n't object to taking rights away in principle , you only object to taking away those rights that you wish to retain . That is quite inconsistent . Where do you get the idea that one has a right to perform an abortion anyway ?
Do you want them all dead ?
There is just one thing however . The coelacanths found are different from those in the fossil record . Further , ALL evidence pointed to them being extinct , until we found other evidence , and we changed it . And , to top it off , the article says NEARLY extinct , not COMPLETELY . Although , this article was of course written after the coelocanths were re-discovered . Of course , this has absolutely nothing to do with the theory of evolution , which explains the mechanisms responsible for the change of allele frequencies in populations over time .
Montalban -- Can you define for me the concept of 'knowledge ' in the sense that you use it ? Would n't 'believe ' be a more accurate word to replace 'know ' in the above statement ? Otherwise , how is it that you can personally 'know ' something that other intelligent and faithful Christians recognize as belief -- not knowledge ?
From that site :
And you think the British would do that ?
Ahah ! The exception that proves the rule !

Scientists pick holes in Darwin moth theory by Robert Matthews in the Sunday Telegraph ( March , 1999 ) I 'm not sure what you mean by the other side of the debate , though . ID ? EAM ? YEC ?
Maybe you 'll have to clear up the difference between `` understanding '' and `` knowing . '' I know what I think the difference is , but I need to know what you mean when you say `` I understand that there is definitely no god . '' Personally , I understand that we have no verification one way or another . All I know is that I do n't know one way or the other .
You 're right , I think he has made such comments . Sorry . I think he 's wrong and went too far .
Just so you do n't shoot them !
And I did n't have to choose to be homosexual . It is a natural inclination . I chose not to hide or lie about who I am . However you are the one who seems to be under the delusion that being gay is a choice . Once again I ask you if it is just a choice then you choose to be gay this moment .
What I find hard to believe is that politicos will place their decision above the health of a woman ; only for political expediency .
Actually what sank that debate was a bunch of paleontologists from K state who started arguing for punctuated equilibrium . That was pretty much the end . I remember one board member was quoted as saying `` These are public schools . We are luck if we can teach the kids to read ''
`` The cultic flaw in Ayn Rand 's philosophy of Objectivism is not in the use of reason , or in the emphasis on individuality , or in the belief that humans are self motivated , or in the conviction that capitalism is the ideal system . The fallacy in Objectivism is the belief that absolute knowledge and final Truths are attainable through reason , and therefore there can be absolute right and wrong knowledge , and absolute moral and immoral thought and action . For Objectivists , once a principle has been discovered through reason to be True , that is the end of the discussion . If you disagree with the principle , then your reasoning is flawed . If your reasoning is flawed it can be corrected , but if it is not , you remain flawed and do not belong in the group . THE UNLIKELIEST CULT IN HISTORY BY MICHAEL SHERMER http : //www.skeptic.com/02.2.shermer-unlikely-cult.html `` Why do so many Objectivists insist on attacking the honesty , integrity , and character of their opponents ? Are such attacks an aberration , or is this sort of behavior actually advocated by Objectivism ? '' http : //www.jeffcomp.com/faq/wrong.html Why do they insist other beliefs are irrational ? ( and yet they do n't think this is an insult ) . It is based on the self-deceipt that what ever it is they believe in is true , and not just true ( as in an opinion ) , but backed by science .
And if one accepts that gay citizens have equal rights under that Constitution , then one has to accept that a ban on gay marriage is intrinsically unconstitutional .
You guys know me . Always happy to correct anyone . As electrolyte pointed out , ( 1 ) the first step in the scientific method is the observation . A scientist observes something that raises a question . ( 2 ) Then comes the hypothesis , that is an attempt to explain the observation . The hypothesis can be an educated guess or even wild speculation based on previous knowledge or intuition , or it may be based in previous science and an understanding of scientific principles . ( 3 ) One then makes a prediction that is a necessary consequence of the hypothesis . That science is predictive is one of its salient characteristics . In the case of the scientific method , the prediction is said to have the power to falsify the hypothesis . In other words , if the prediction can be shown to be false , then the hypothesis must also be false . If the prediction is true , then the hypothesis is supported . So now we have the observation , the hypothesis that explains the observation , and a prediction that is a consequence of the hypothesis . The next step ( 4 ) is to design an experiment to test the prediction , and then ( 5 ) to perform the test . If the prediction fails the test , then it may be abandoned . However , as electrolyte pointed out , the process may be circular , because if the prediction is falsified , additional observation from the test may be used to adjust the hypothesis at ( 2 ) , and a new prediction is made at ( 3 ) , and so on . In creation science , the process stops at ( 2 ) , except that the hypothesis is based on dogma and scripture , not reality .
First off , not all pro-choice advocates support this position . Second , How does a sonogram help to make an informed choice ? What does a sonogram actually inform a pregnant woman about ... that she is pregnant ? I would think that if she was going to get a sonogram , that she would know that she is already pregnant . Seems like simple logic to me . By saying it would help them make a better choice , do n't you really mean to say that it might influence them to not have an abortion , which is actually your choice for them ? You seem to be counting on the puppy store effect . You can drive by the puppy store every day without giving a thought to buying a puppy . But if you actually stop and look at one , you might just feel sorry for the pathetic little puppy couped up in the little cage , and decide to buy it just to `` rescue '' it from it 's plight . It goes something like this : `` awww ... look at the cute little puppy , we ca n't leave it here , we just have to take it home '' . 4 months later , that same cute little puppy is sitting in an SPCA shelter waiting to either be adopted or destroyed . All because it 's do-gooder owner made the decision to buy it based on emotion rather than informed choice .
I shuddered at same but did n't want to say anything lest I be dubbed PC .
Your making a bunch of arbitrary statments .
So biology did n't exist before the theory of evolution was formulated ?
And you are on intimate terms with the Queen , eh ? By the way , what is it exactly that that little thingy above signifies ? I hope I have used the right emotive whatchamacallit .
But would n't the baby inside own their body as well ?
So then will you go the way on liberty ( repeal stoopid laws ) or tyranny ( enact more unconstitutional laws ) ?

You 've avoided the question . God does not fill the word `` who '' because to most accounts he is not a person , or being . But for your sake I will restate the question . Who is God ? Describe God to me . What is that you believe in ?
Many ( all ? ) other religions have the idea of a creation event by one or more gods at the beginning . Why would the author single out just one religion and ignore all others ? Further `` the athiest '' gave up the idea of the universe having always been decades ago . The author is disingenuous - or ill-informed - when he suggests otherwise . At the end of a big waffle about the `` big bang '' and thermodynamics , the author asserts that `` The atheist 's assertion that matter/energy is eternal is scientifically wrong . The biblical assertion that there was a beginning is scientifically correct . '' and then leaps to `` If we know the creation has a beginning ... '' So suddenly `` the universe '' becomes `` creation '' and the `` study '' continues confident that it has established biblical creation is `` scientifically correct '' . The article then moves on to offer a series of unsupported assertions that for `` creation '' ( ie the universe ) to not have a cause , all of our `` laws of conservation of angular momentum '' and our `` laws of conservation of electric charge '' would have to be wrong . No supporting evidence is offered for these bold claims . Thus , the bible 's caused beginning ( again other religions are ignored ) fits with `` the available scientific evidence '' . Handy eh ? So now we `` know that the creation had a beginning and we know that the beginning was caused '' ( we know no such thing , but the author marches confidently on anyway ) we move onto design . Here an appeal to incredulity fallacy is neatly tied in with gross distortion of the anthropic principle and another false dichotomy to claim that everything must be designed because it could n't happen by chance . The next step is to claim that the author has shown practical proof of the Chrisian God 's existence ( other gods being ignored once more ) . How such a piece of poorly argued philosophy can be viewed as `` practical '' is n't explained . Then it neatly guides the reader to the shop by the exit : `` We have books , audio tapes , video tapes , correspondence courses , and booklets available and all can be obtained on loan without cost . Just request our catalog from ... '' In summary , the `` study '' offers up the same old sleight-of-hand `` logic '' that typifies `` proofs '' of deities , creation , design etc . It is n't as bad as some though as it contains only small levels of dishonesty . It is a blatant piece of marketing though aimed at selling books , videos etc to the gullible .
Actually , gay marriages will probably be recognized everywhere in the US within a decade or so . They may not be performed everywhere , but they will be recognized .
It 's still the same argument . A fetus is a citizen , it 's intrustion on the fetus , ( and the pregant woman ? ) OR A fetus is not a citizen , it 's intruston on the pregant woman .

What else would you expect from the people who created a god in their own image ? Your thinking here is right , religion has a long history of being egocentric .
So Bloomberg is suggesting that the ATF should seek to prosecute anyone and everyone , evidence or not . This is n't how law enforcement works . This is n't how the Constitution works . You ca n't be prosecuted for a crime that you did n't commit , and for which there is no evidence to link you to it . But that 's not good enough for Bloomberg , oh no . Bloomberg wants to ATF to view anyone attending a gun show as absolutely guilty , and subject to arrest , detainment and prosecution without evidence or witnesses , thus violating a person 's Sixth Amendment rights . And as I said before . Bloomberg makes absolutely no recommendation for what to do with these 35 , supposedly , criminals sellers . He did n't want them charged with felonies , he did n't file civil suits against them , he did n't do anything . He just got the `` evidence '' he wanted and then he let them go scot free as if they 'd done nothing . Obviously New York City style catch and release justice at its absolute finest . Also note how the report refers to the SKS as `` assault rifles '' . There 's not a single feature on the SKS that would qualify it as either as `` assault rifle '' or an `` assault weapon '' .
Nope . Not part of evolutionary theory . It would be stupid to claim that increased genetic variability would `` disallow '' any portion of the population from breeding .
Heh , half the science with twice the religion , nice

The reality is that it 's the ANTI-GAY side who too often include pretenses of `` society imploding '' ...

Another characteristic in this same general area that ties us back to fish is the development of our parathyroid glands - which are very similar to gill buds in fish - from a particular pharyngeal arch : the same one that in fish gives rise to the gill buds ! Moving on to the kidneys for a minute . The human embryo forms not one , but 3 successive kidneys : the pronephric , mesonephric , and metanephric kidneys . Only that last one persists and only it is the kidney you and I and all of our fellow humans use . Why do human embryos go through two transient and simpler kidneys before getting it right ? Here 's a hint : the other two are carry overs from simpler organisms ! The evolutionarily simplest vertebrates , such as hagfish and teleost fish , develop only the pronephric kidney : it is their adult functional kidney . Now move up an evolutionary notch to ( other ) fish and amphibians . In their embryos , the first kidney still develops , but soon begins to degenerate and is replaced by the mesonephric kidney , which is the functional adult kidney in these organisms . Now move up another evolutionary notch , to reptiles , birds , and mammals . Their embryos form the first kidney , which then degenerates and is replaced by the second kidney , which then degenerates and is replaced by the final , metanephric kidney : their adult functional kidney . The above is not anywhere near a complete list of embryological evidences for common descent/evolution . PS : Note the serial addition of developmental stages that occurs in kidneys as one moves up to higher evolutionary levels : `` ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny '' . Of course this `` law '' does not hold for all organs/organ systems in all organisms , but it does hold for a few cases . And that 's enough to clearly indicate evolution of those organ systems by their being retained from ancestors and then modified during embryonic development .
And ends with the woman , whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy .
Yes . For example , the hawthorn maggot fly was observed to change into the apple maggot fly in only a few years . I also gave the example of the herring gull/lesser black-backed gull that exists as a single , continuous population the circles the globe in which the extremes have become seperate species . Of course , what you are asking is if it has ever been observed that a frog turned into a lion . But that is n't evolution . In fact , a saltation ( that is the word for that silly idea ) would disprove the current theory of evolution . Organisms change only a little from generation to generation . Generally , evolution is a slow process since it happens in populations , not individuals . Evolution is a change in the genetic makeup of the entire population of over generations .

if the laws of logic are human constructs then how can they be absolute since humans think differently and often contradictorily . If they are produced from human minds , and human minds are mutually contradictory , then how can the constructs be absolute ? Therefore , the laws of logic are not human constructs .
Obviously not . If the right to life trumps all other rights , then it follows that the mother 's right to life and the child 's right to life cancel each other out . Mind you , if it 's her choice then the pro-life movement endorses such heroism , right ?
In all fairness the Pharmacist does serve an important vetting role in the supply of medication to patients- they check what has been prescribed by the doctor against they know about and correct errors that are made ( which do happen ...

you know what..you are right , any unwanted person should be killed . Lets start with nursing homes and then move on to mental health clinics .

Kill them ... it is merciful ... who cares what they want anyway , they do n't know what they are saying . Then we will have a wonderful society
Recent comparisons between the complete chimp genome and the human genome have found that possibly fewer than 3 million nucleotide differences exist in functional DNA .
Not one that a solid case can be made for . If it happened they would be numberless just as Darwin said . Dr. Colin Patterson , Senior Paleontologist of the British Museum of Natural History , in an interview on BBC television , said ... I mean the stories , the narratives about change over time . How the dinosaurs became extinct , how the mammals evolved , where man came from . These seem to me to be little more than story-telling . And this is the result about cladistics because as it turns out , as it seems to me , all one can learn about the history of life is learned from systematics , from groupings one finds in nature . The rest of it is story-telling of one sort or another . We have access to the tips of a tree , the tree itself is a theory and people who pretend to know about the tree and to describe what went on with it , how the branches came off and the twigs came off are , I think , telling stories Storrs Olson , curator of birds at the National Museum of Natural History said : `` The idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at Nature and National Geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith . Truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program , which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age -- -the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion .

No it ca n't . Scientific theories are n't `` proven '' . You can observe the fact of gravity but you ca n't `` prove '' that the theory that explains it is correct . In fact , the theory of gravitation is one of the least secure theories of modern science .

you based this ( and other claims ) on a summary of the biomorphs program at website that either a ) did n't also provide dawkins limitations on the program or b ) had the limitations and you did n't bother to relay this information to the forum . You then make incredulous statements about how unrealistic the biomorphs are . any quotations of web pages are irrelevant because they do not address the basic issue that you are suggesting dawkins puts the biomorphs forth as a model of evolution and natural selection . This is not true as i have quoted part of his book that puts limitations on the biomorphs program , and draws attention to what `` morals '' should be drawn out of the biomorphs .
Dealt with . Wolves and dogs share a genus , not a species . Along with coyotes and jackels . See above for lots of transitionals , also .
No , I for one dislike your posts because I know you intentionally write irrational posts to help support your religious cause . Just for the record montalban , basically every single legitimate scientist is `` pro-evolution '' . Creation theory is not taught in public schools , not by chance , but because ... *gasp* it 's RELIGIOUS MUMBO JUMBO . There is no evidence to support it . Creation fiction has made no progress with it 's `` faith-based '' ( lackofevidence ) with rational people . And I 'll also say that I 'd welcome ad hominem over irrational thinking any day . Ad hominem is just a lack of patience , or someone who does n't care to hide their emotion or opinion . Irrational thinking on the other hand is often only cured by death . Someone guilty of ad hominem can still hold a rational debate . The irrational..well , why bother ? -Mach
Just like no one is really `` for '' abortions , but they think that it 's the woman 's right to decide . Maybe that 's like when congress gave the President the right to decide to go to war , even when they were supposed to declare war .
Because you are a Darwinist - this predictible insult testifies to my rightness . Your approval/compliments would of supported my wrongness . Ray M .
But gun control does n't mean more lives saved so therefore , your entire statement is wrong . Your idea of gun control works ONLY in an ideal world . In your ideal world , everyone will give up their guns for the good of society . In this world , we will go back and forget that guns ever existed outside of the military . Thus , there will be no shooting deaths because no one has possession of a gun . However , your utopia can not exist because of the human tendancy to seek power . Marx thought that if everyone became equal , there would be no problems , and everyone could live together in perfect harmony . However , when everyone tried to live together , there was a group who tried to rise up and gain more power . In the end , people began to realize that Marx 's ideas would not work because there would be an elite few who would attempt to screw everyone else over . Gun control would produce the same results . The people would be the law-abiding citizens , and that elite few would be the criminals . The criminals , realizing that the rest of the people have no guns , would then attain guns through illegal means . They could then use their guns against the innocent law-abiding citizens , who have given up their guns and now have no equal force to resist with . It will become like prohibition with guns instead of alcohol .
Yes , I know what it is . I also know of mothers who have never breast-fed . Are you trying to imply that , because a baby is sometimes breast-fed , it retains a biological connection to the mother similar to the umbilical cord ? I 'd call that stretching the boundaries of 'biological connection ' , personally ... Before birth , if the mother dies , the foetus dies ( with one noticable exception that I know of ) . After birth , this is no longer the case .
So can women can cure themselves ? Is that what you mean ? Or do you mean that once they forgive themselves they can move on to help other women do the same ? thanks in advance ...
Me , too . I 'd probably throw in some counseling as well , just for starters .
Translation = `` I 've closed my brain off and I 've got not nothing . ''
Well any group or individual not spouting left-tard drivel is actually a hate group . The military is of such low intellect that they are easy to sway into hate groups . Hence the homeland insecurity warning on returning veterans .
Hit that one right on the head , Symbiote . I 'd like to hear supersport 's response to this .
You could put it in the form of a resolution , in the debate challanges forum .
Well , assuming that when the Bible says `` you '' in passages that are telling `` you '' to do something with your soul , I would hope that it also applies to women . But it never comes out and says `` women and men have souls . '' This does n't mean they do n't have them . Same thing with animals . The book is n't written for non-humans , so when it says `` you '' we can assume it does n't refer to non-humans . But the book never says `` animals do n't have souls . '' So we ca n't assume that they do n't ( according to the bible ) .
My bet is on the latter since I have yet to see any serious debate beyond insults from it . Since it is West Palm Beach police department doing the deal Miami is out in left field . Pardon the redundancy .
So why should you care about their non-scientific beliefs in a debate on science ? Most people who believe in evolution do so because of science , so their non-scientific beliefs are irrelevant .
Could you avoid your constant use of strawman`s fallacies please ?
Irrelevant . Whatever kind of person or mother she is , the argument would apply .
Because there 's absolutely no due process in this proposal . Your name is on the list , your rights are revoked . That 's not due process . There 's no court of law , no trial , no verdict , no attorneys , no chance for the accused to defend themselves , etc . We still have n't forgotten the Homeland Security memo that said veterans and those opposed to abortion could be potential terrorists .
Well if it has nothing to do with a militia that would mean that the preamble is merely unnecessary verbiage . So you want people to just ignore the plain text of the Second Amendment- at least the part you do n't like . The preamble lets us know that the main focus if not the sole focus of this amendment is the militia . David Konig is another historian that has found both the individual rights interpretation and the collective interpretation unsatisfactory . He says the Second Amendment protects an individual right that is exercised collectively . `` Indeed , to serve in the militia and participate in this civic duty was more than a duty : it was a civic right of a peculiarly eighteenth-century nature unlike either the 'individual ' or 'collective ' models argued for today . On neither side of the Atlantic , that is , did the debate concern itself with this right in the present-day sense of an 'individual ' or personal constitutional right ; but at the same time , its common emphasis on widespread individual arms-bearing for public service distinguishes it from today 's narrowly applied 'collective ' application to the National Guard . No individual right existed unrelated to service in a well-regulated militia ; no effective militia could serve its purpose without an armed citizenry . This type of right may appear paradoxical to us today , but it fitted 'the inner coherence of a given system of beliefs'4 held by people in the past , and which made sense to those familiar with the concept of an individual right exercised collectively .

How very true . Anti abortion people feel their opinions should be forced upon a women and her choice about her body should not matter . They would feel different if someone were telling them they could n't have a tumor or parasite removed from them because of someone elses belief system .
Also already covered in my thread-starting post . ( Im not overlooking your further thoughts on this : they follow ) .
how can sin even exist if God is contsnatly monitoring the decision process ? does he approve of the sins that are commited ? if the only decisions we can make are the ones God approves , then how is it so much sin is being commited ?
So you are more knowledgeable about biology than all of the biologists who have spent their lives studying the topic ? You have repeatedly demonstrated you ignorance and many of us have repeatedly instructed you in the fundamentals of biology and science , and yet you claim to know more than real scientists ?
And if I did then so what ? Hiter 's Mom and Saddam 's Mom both were given the option to abort their pregnancies by nurses and decided against it . So I guess this makes pro-lifers responsible for the holocaust and the slaughter of Kurds ?
The fetus is also a parasite , and if the woman chooses to do so , she has the right to extract it from her body .
Then I do n't get your point that I am not affected by abortion .
So you view is that their religious freedom is more important then mine ? That their families are more important then mine ?
You could have saved yourself some typing if you had of read the premise at all :
You speak as if these two things are mutually exclusive , they are not . Government control of guns only works on those willing to obey the law . Government can not control criminals , they can and should however punish them when they catch them . Allow me to ask you a question : Which is more important a perceived saftey via government control or the freedoms endowed by our creator and enumerated in the bill of rights ? I asked you before ( you did n't answer ) what rights are you willing to give up for what you perceive as a safer life ? You once posted that you were studied in the ways of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young , as it could be argued that religion has killed more people then cancer would you be willing to give up that freedom ? How about if the government said you can own a Bible but not a Koran ? Or you could only buy one religios text per month ?
Thanks for the complement on intelligence .
So you 're saying evolution never enters politics , and Creationists never consider science ?
Sounds anti-government to me . Are you against your President 's economic policies , the fed , bureacracy and tee poor public education ? Sounds probably who SEIU should have directed their gall toward and not a man 's personal property and family ... with the police help of course and purloined school busses . Do the taxpayers owe the SEIU anything ? Nope but the SEIU according to CNN owes more than 90 million along with 4 million in interest . Perhaps if they paid their bills they would n't add to the public debt by using government property to protest government policy ? You wrote it but did n't understand what you wrote ... darn public schools
If a child comes in for an abortion and fears abuse from her parents then law enforcement should be notified . The only people protected by opposing notification laws are abusers and pedophiles . No elective , invasive medical proceedure should be performed on a child without the consent of a parent or judge . If a minor is allowed to have an abortion without consent the parents/ guardians will have no idea whats been done to this child should complications arise , they would n't be able to give this information to a ER doctor or the childs pediatrition .
Well , there are books and scientific journals and what not . This XXXX shows up in my son 's science class and he will be hearing each and every day from his mother how it is not science and I will get him access to real science information . Yikes .
What would you know about fair and balanced ? I know a lot of truths about gays . Do you want me to start posting incessant threads pointing them all out ? And I am the moderator for the formal debate forum , not the entire board . Want to debate me on the benefits of gays on society vs Christianity ?
What 's `` cumulative selection ? '' Do you mean a series of mutations with small but beneficial influence that occur over the period of thousands or millions of years ? Just how do you propose to observe such mutations ? In fact , we can observe such mutations by comparing the genomes of related species .
These items do not have killing as their primary use .
Which falls to logic I laid out in my thread-starting post
Well ... You can apparently read , but what you have apparently chosen to read - and accept - says much .
The burden of a pregnancy is the woman 's . It should be left up to her and her doctor to decide what is best for her .
Why not ? You said yourself kalifornia was a `` trend setter '' . It is alread the law in many states .
So what this guy is saying is that he believes in natural selection but not evolution ?
Oh dear God your ignorance is abundant ! Do you not understand what the federal DOMA law does ?
When was the last mass murder at a UK university then ?
But do you think that more assumptions is more likely to be correct ?
Under the illogical view of the 14th amendment that currently occupies our court system there is nothing more about it than convincing 5 judges that it is n't immoral . Let 's not pretend this is anything related to what the amendment actually says because we both know it is n't .
I was referring to being foolish enough to engage in an actual debate supporting the teaching of creationism in science class . We did get one taker though .
Because evolution is a scientific theory , and has evidence for it . Creationism is religion . ID is bad science , and bad theology.. and there is no evidence for . If you look at the people who push it , and the place where their funding is coming from , you can see it is a religious front for far right CHristians . Many Chrisitans do not have a problem with evolution . They are what are known as 'theistic Evolutionists ' , who feel that God directs the course of evolution . The intelligent ones of those realise that is a religious belief , not something that can be proven , hence it is an object of faith . Evolution can be demonstrated in the lab . It makes predictions that can be tested . And , with 150 years of testing , it has not been able to be falsified .
So bring on the witnesses ! Sounds like a very cold case to me . And how could the early christians witness the creation ? They came around much later and its believed that the lab book was written long long after the fact - very bad practice for evidence that !
Well , that 's pretty confused . You seem to be grasping at straws . You do n't seem to understand and you are thrashing about in an effort to make yourself look as if you understand . Clearly you do n't understand .
Oh , well in that case , there may be no debate at all ...
But I did n't . I established the connection in my first answer the connection was primates . If I 'd have said `` Apes '' then you 'd have something to work with . You do n't . He just assumed I was mixed up . And even when I answered him about what the connection is , he still just went on assuming this .
Concepts do not `` come from '' somewhere , they are not physical entities and do not have physical properties such as locations , beginnings or ends . They do not require a creator , physical ( the universe ) or imaginary ( God ) .
But , these are still males and females of the human species passing on their genetic capacity to reproduce themselves , which we know Gay folks can not do in nature . GL , Terral
This is wrong . You yourself find `` mental existence '' to be `` sacred ' in a way . There is no rational argument for mental existence being the point of obtaining rights ... no matter how hard any of us try
And all life is in transition . Even the roach . Bacteria as we speak are evolving .
Yes
as far as all observable evidence dictates , the laws of nature are what sustains the universe . there is not one single function of nature that isnt on `` autopilot '' as it were . that is , no function needed to sustain the universe occurs outside of natural law . what 's more , nothing that defies natural law ( whether universe-sustaining or not ) ever occurs in observable reality I 'm glad you responded Nu Leader . this is this issue that really hits the religion/science divide . as it is , God has been gradually and subliminally coralled in the spiritual realm . there is absolutely nothing in the physical and observable world that is a function of God , or a manifestation of supernatural power . in other words , in the realm of the physical , God has no turf . even if God does exist , he does not ( and by biblical definition , can not ) physically manifest his being nor the effect of his power this leaves us with the spiritual realm . this realm , whether it exists or not , does affect people . yet this realm is as elusive and intangible as God himself . the same realm that God is believed to abive and reign in , is said to be the same realm that humans enter only when they die . i have many thoughts about the effects of this spiritual realm on reality , but for now i think its sufficient to say that God is limited to the spiritual realm only
Well , according to Descartes , if I have an idea of a most perfect being , I shall distinctly perceive that such a being must contain all perfections - including reality in every degree . So this idea also contains existence . God 's essence is to exist , and of no other thing can this be said . ( Existence in everything else being contingent . ) To refute these arguments , and some philosophers doubt they can be refuted , I think you will need to take another tack .
well that could happen if somhow you mutated into some..i dunno ... 600 armed person . ?
Well , that is the argument that one hears from creationists so often . So when are you going to get to the most delicious , highly satisfying entertainment ? Even more important , when are you going to expose the theory of evolution ? YOu do n't seriously propose that your little series of cow pies is actually meaningful , do you ?
Yes I was 17 years old before , but if I asked a question , or told my business , I was mature enough to deal with the responses whether they were in my favor or not . Now that I 'm 26 I can take people not agreeing with me . I 'm not knocking her decision , just her attitude .
Your lungs depend on partial pressure to oxygenate your blood . A change in percentage concentration will result in a change in partial pressure . This affects how we breathe . Projections show that with global warming there will be a vast increase in ocean cloud coverage , resulting in inhibited growth and photosynthesis of ocean plants , resulting in a lower yield of O2 on average .
Actually , you can . You can get a cap and ball revolver via mail order LEGALLY .
Well actually I have not seen your point of view expressed anywhere but on these forums . Seems to me if its rising to ascendancy at least ONE scientist somewhere would have recently at least mentioned it . Quick search reveals NO mentions at all . Of course if you say its displacing NDS then I guess I will have to agree - you being a well known biologist and all , but I remain perhaps a bit irrationaly skeptical .
Yes , you are 100 % correct . Criminals would be sure to pay the tax on their illegally owned pistol , just like they pay income tax on drug money . Oh , wait they do n't pay tax on their drug money . Most criminals break the law you see .
you mean like partially pregnant or almost pregnant or almost a virgin ? I do n't have a beef with God , I only pick on guys shorter or weaker than I .
But even the dictionary definition contains multiple meanings - reflecting the multiple uses of a particular word - and even many of those definitions were vaguely stated . I think that most people on both sides of the debate value `` human rights '' . In valuing `` human rights '' , they have a particular image in mind of what is `` human '' in that case . Do you really think that , by forcing them to acknowledge one of the dictionary definitions of `` human '' , you will change their view on who or what deserves `` human rights '' ? There view is based not on official definitions but on underlying feelings of what , in humans , they value - and mental existence is one criteria that is a requirement for them and for myself . I do n't know who the main person is that is pushing the arguements about definitions now - you or Shooterandproud or ShadowPickachu or Sigma or gman , etc - but , whoever it is , please think about what exactly it is you are trying to accomplish . Do you seriously think that changing a persons definition of a word will alter their view on abortion rights ?
He probably should have been specific , and said 'the literal 6 day creation of Genesis ' Then again , it never was meant to be taken literally . There are too many puns , and political refrences in it to be literal
See above , yet again
If guns make you happy and you do not break and criminal codes . Then you need no reason nor do you have to justify yourself to anyone . The Constitution or firearms laws have nothing to do with `` if you need one '' .
You did when you talked about someone loving objects , or a mokey , etc .
Well lets see here . You dont want me to trash the constitution , yet the constitution allows terrorists to take guns onto planes and really makes it easy for them . Do you think that our laws have shifted away from the constitution just for the fun of trashing it ? Id say the changes made were done to be practical and reasonable . The bottom line isnt about rights , it is about what works . Your idea doesnt work . We have already established that . The current system in place already works . You can add your 11 steps if you want but most of that is already in place . `` Enact no laws or regulations that affect , change , or modify the behavior of good citizens '' Do you know what that means ? That is so vague that it could mean you have the right to do absolutely anything you want . There are laws that say you need to stop at a red light , should we change that ? Or do we need to stop at red lights to be a good citizen ? There are laws that state we need to keep our pets on a leash in public , should we change that ? Or do we need to keep our pets on a leash in public to be a good citizen ? There are laws that state that we can not bring guns onto planes , should we change that ? Or do we need to keep guns off planes to be a good citizen ? Does this change your perception at all ? You happily ignore whether your plan will work and just focus on getting your way . Lets focus on you getting your way then . We already know the airline industry is gone soon after your laws go into place and so are a few buildings . Now lets focus on the bad parts of town . The cops are now not only outnumbered , but out armed . The cop death toll will jump and that will mean we need more cops . More cops means more costs on top of the costs you already mentioned . So now we have more law protectors in place meaning good citizens are already being affected . You will have more murders assuming the current trend would continue as more guns are in place . So now good citizens have to deal with more death and no airplanes . What about schools ? Columbines more often obviously . How about going postal at work since everyone will have a gun there ? How about assassinations ? We havent had one in a very long time , but I would expect that if people can carry guns around our president that he will be in far more danger than ever before in our history and so will other important people . Oh and how about at sports games ! Yeah everyone loves a good emotional sporting event just as much as they love getting drunk there ! Just think of the possibilities there ! ONeal goes up for the rebound and comes down with a bullet in his chest . Now there is a shoot out as the Lakers fans retaliate . Oh why are all these guns here anyways ? Is it really necessary ? Maybe a little dramatic but expect sporting attendance to drop as well . Most public events would suffer in the same way I would expect . Does this bother you at all ? Do you think there will be consequences to this ? Can you give answers that will solve all of these problems to the extent they are today or even better ?
And again , but no other animal that can fly has also conquered breathing under water as we have , or has learned to travel on land faster than the fastest mammal can run . But we fly , breathe underwater and travel faster than a cheetah as if it was second nature . No other animal in creation has attained what we have , or even come close . As I said , only humanity has evolved past having to survive in the natural World as all other animals on Earth do .

And the assertion that pregnancy is a `` wonderful miracle '' would be what ?
They can `` marry '' whomever they love . Benefits though , are a different matter . The state and society views marriage as an opposite-sex institution . It 's not about anyone getting harmed ; no one said it was .
I see , thanks for answering my question .
But did n't they tell you ? They outsourced your job to me !
I believe in a strict interpretation of the Constitution , this makes me neither a liberal or conservative . The SN was inspired by VOR who kept signing his posts with quotes from Karl Marx .
When FDR started social security he was betting that most americans would not be around to collect . The average life span at the time was below 66 years . Since then americans have been insulting the state and disrupting it 's plans by not dying young enough .

Let 's ask our California resident what he thinks of this new law . A waste of money in financial crunch time , or just good law making ? However , that is not the only options . You can say whatever you like . It is a free country . At least for now . Given all of the new laws being made , and the bureaucracy they create , thus adding more and further regs . associated with bigger government , the trend does n't look good for Freedom from governmental intrusions . But at least for now .
Well said . The truth of the matter is society 's desire to hang blame on obvious contributing circumstances rather than attributing anything to developments leading up to and cumulating in that circumstance . Take away guns , knifes , etc . and something will be used , perhaps a deadly spray poison with components and mixing instructions available on the Internet . People will clamor to censor the Internet but distance themselves from social ills or personality defects as the basic , underlying cause .
And as a result of his Bible studies he rejected the Trinity .
That 's really simplified . It 's not like a woman 's body is a suitcase and the fetus is biologically self-reliant . It lives off her life processes - her blood , her immune system , her calories - it puts stress on her joints , muscles , heart , and bladder . Pregnacy can demand major sacrifices in behavior and diet - some of which can be detrimental . No a baby is n't the woman 's body - but a pregnancy IS .
What ? The understanding of HOX genes has n't actually changed the understanding of mutations to other genes . It has added an additional dimension . I 'm not sure what you mean by `` the old way , '' but an understanding of regulatory genes does not negate anything that went before . It only adds understanding . Sadly , you do n't seem to understand .
No I wo n't walk into that situation . What you feel to be right is OK with me . It is what you feel to be right and try to make it public policy is what I disagree with . You should fear yourself . YOU are a greater danger to yourself than a felon with a firearm . You have an extremely skewed sense of risk assement . I do n't expect to change your mind , after all I do n't expect to convince someone with an irrational fear of flying that it is safe . Want to kill yourself ? Sucide ? That is very irrational is n't it ?
This topic was discussed in another thread . Kelvin said that- `` If it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941 , you would be speaking Japanese if you live on the Westcoast , German if you live on the Eastcoast . '' Urban Legend . It should be illegal for women to have sex .
Any form of legislation is a voting matter . That 's the way our system works .
EvC Forum : Evolution & amp ; Other Sciences 3 ) Geology , specifically regarding the location of where the algae and other plant life in the past died and was compressed into oil . Big Fossil geologists consult evolutionary biologists and archelogists for where large concentrations of these organisms were and start looking there . One of the key things they look for in rock samples is the presence of fossils of these diatoms . Now , creationists are going to want to try to change the subject away from providing a product . That just shows they have nothing .
Well then present it and stop being stupid .
I believe the earliest gospel estimation is placed around 50 ad , which is almost 30 years after Jesus died .
And your little pre-Christianity Roman history is relevant because ... ... . ?
This shows that people have heart problems even when they 're not obese and do n't consume fatty foods , which goes AGAINST your original argument .
and what about the infant mortalities , child deaths due to accidents , death in general . as it stands , the mother retains the right to terminate the life of her child if she decides she doesnt want to parent it . however , she has a relatively small window of time to decide , and after that she cant change her option ... or can she ... at some point the mother loses that right , and the child gains the right to live . however , what if the mother decides that she is not ready or equiped to be a parent ( for instance , after the child is born she loses her ability to work , or the father abandons her , or some other similar situation ) . legally , shes unable to do anything since she lost the option to kill the child at that point . morally , the motive would have been the same as if she had decided to abort the child earlier
Unchanging 66 books ? ? You mean that the 4 books that Martin Luthor rejected is n't a change.. Or the 80 odd books that are considered canon by the Ethopian Orthodox ? ?
Actually yes , but not for the purposes of ilegal search or seisure , I have active duty military friends . They drop by all the time . Obviously your great lack of friends makes that idea hard to understand .
And who would pick the 'some ' ? Perhaps you also believe they should be placed on Ritilin ... for their own protection ... because their teachers ( without medical training ) diagnose the infamous ADD demon in them . Not to get off topic too far , some teachers evidently have trouble recognizing the difference between students that ca n't seem to pay attention and themselves ( the teachers ) being in dire need of coming across as interesting . What makes you think teachers or parents could ever become adept at recognizing who needs to put on birth control ? Shall we wait 'til one becomes pregnant ? Shall we offer a survey of sexual activities ? ... to what age group ?
you told me in an earlier post that the mother should die , even if they predict the fetus will kill the mother . your bible states otherwise .
And you can `` lol '' all you want . So tell me what it is about a brain that has not developed that requires more protection than a brain that is temporarily out of commission ? And yes , we could very well debate potentials , but that is a different branch of the bigger picture and personally I do n't see a reason to go down it , at least not at this point .
I 'm not completely sure what you mean by `` personal identity '' , but it sounds similar to what I called `` sense of self '' . It is a hard term to define . Sense of self is different than a recognition of self . I have heard that babies do not have a recognition of self - in the sense that , though they have personal experiences of pain , sensation , etc , they do not recognize themselves as separate from others - they just do n't think about their separateness so there is no recognition of a separate `` I '' . Similarly , most animals may have a sense of self - they may have a central mental center which feels the sensations , experiences the emotions , etc . - but many do not necessarily have a recognition of themselves as an `` I '' and others as `` you '' . They just do n't think about the separateness - they just have experiences that they react to . Where mental existence is concerned and criteria I use to define it , many of the criteria I listed ( thought , emotion , sense of pain , perception of experiences , sense of self , etc . ) are interdependent ( ex . emotion can be thought of as a type of thought , it takes a type of thought to recognize pain or sensation , etc . ) . However , roughly speaking , I would say that `` any of the above '' criteria would be enough to define a minimum mental existence - and thus define a person . On a last point , why is memory important to you ? Various people who have experienced major brain trauma have lost most memory function - so they have no memory of who they are , what they were doing one minute ago , etc . One can imagine that the extreme situation would be someone who has no memory at all - so he has no words to communicate , no memory of a personal history . Indeed , every experience is completely new , including the experience of pain , pleasure , etc . However , this memory-less person can still have experiences ( feel pain , pleasure , experience the input of the senses , etc . ) . He would be completely baffled as to what any experience at all is telling him , but he would still have the experiences . Extremely limited as that person would be , I would still call him a person . I 'm not sure if that is the type of memory that you were referring to . If not , then please clarify .
So , by your logic , if there 's a bad cop in New York , then all the cops in Boise , Idaho must be bad as well .
Please define complexity . Please define information . Both definitions should be relevant to biology .
Yet there is evidence aganist Bush and you have a double standard on applying your attacks on Kerry to Bush even when the same circumstances apply .
So what ? Most of them are still getting killed with guns . A Red Herring is a fallacy in which an irrelevant topic is presented in order to divert attention from the original issue . The basic idea is to `` win '' an argument by leading attention away from the argument and to another topic . This sort of `` reasoning '' has the following form : 1 . Topic A is under discussion . 2 . Topic B is introduced under the guise of being relevant to topic A ( when topic B is actually not relevant to topic A ) . 3 . Topic A is abandoned .
You must have been watching the same sunday morning tv political talk show as I was semi-listening to this morning . Some pro-abortion woman went off on a tangent about the phrase `` abortion on demand '' . Would `` abortion for convienence '' be more accurate ?
But you are trying to debunk the theory , right ? If it can be accepted by atheists , agnostics , theists , and the catholic church , how can you say that it is completely atheistic ?
Read what i actually wrote for a change Yank .
The way it works in Kansas , the state board of education sets the guidelines and sends them out to all the school districts where they sit in a box in a closet somewhere . During much of the time when all this idiocy was going on , I was ON the local school board and had never once opened one of those books . We all knew they existed , and nearly half of us knew where ours were , it was just not something that anybody generally cares to look at . I would be shocked if you could find me 10 kids in the entire state who have ever read the state school boards definition of `` science '' or their guidelines . It is just not something that comes up . IMO , that is why this issue came up in kansas . Our state school board here has VERY little power or control , so nobody really pays attention to them . When the first set of changes occured , there was a lag of about 6 months before anybody even realized it and then it was somebody from the media .
That 's not quite true either . Federal laws grant many rights and privledges to married people . The feds may not have a say on who can get married , but there are federal laws that benefit married people .
So Goddidit ? I see you still have n't gotten back to the thread where 'intelligent design ' was shown to be nothing more then `` we ignorant , therefore Goddidit . '' Nor did you explain away how ID is any different then Animism . If you took someone who lived in the jungle all his life , took some food , put it in a microwave and then served to him and asked him how the food got hot , what would you expect him to say ? Magic most likely as that has been the outcome of similar situations in the past . What we know to be a simple electromagnetic device is magic to him . Just because we do not know does not mean God was responsible . If you think like that , then 10,000 years of human cognitive advancement has skipped you .
Well , you have proven yoruself to be a man with no brain , that is for sure . The definition that was given was the one that scientists use , not the layperson .
OMG Brady , he betrayed HIS PEOPLE ? and I thought WE THE PEOPLE were his people .
no base for calling it a human being ? Other than the fact that a fetus is scientifical a human being . Seems you have no basis for saying I ca n't call a fetus a human being .
Darned Swiss gun laws !
No I 'm not Kronus . I have n't made excuses for him or denied what he did . OP said he is a conservative Christian which is a lie and I 'm exposing that lie for what it is . Unless she can prove he is anything more than a conservative secular Republican , then he is no more a morally responsible person than an atheistic democrat . To attempt to mark all fundamental christians with the actions of this guy because he 's a republican is a truly fallacious argument and a slanderous lie regarding me and all believers . None of this excuses what Vitter himself is responsible for doing . But she is wrong for immorally attempting to paint us all as adulterers because of his sin .
Because most people are Christian .
actually many argue this . More argue that the human fetus is not a person . I did n't know a living human could not be a person though .
But the military is pretty much all a volunteer thing . It 's not a hiring process -- employer/employee thing . That arrangement lends itself more to the soldier not volunteering for service in the first place .
Does n't count . Took place in a `` gun free zone '' . By law no guns are allowed there , so by law this incident could n't take place .
I 'll assume this is figurative since they do not literally melt .
Well good at least you are aware there is no reason beyond your opinion of morality against gay marriage . So by all means do n't marry a man and the problem is solved .
Just trying to help out where I can , and if it proves you right well that makes a first time huh ? Sarge its a first ! !
A mind is what makes one a person . No mind , no person .
No , Im saying all three of them could have been naughty , but the other two were teachers pets . Lets name the children , lets call the one who was punished ~ID~ , and well call the first of the two pets ~atheistic evolution~ and well call the other unpunished one ~global warming~ . AE and GW have influential parents , they attend a lot of PTA meetings , and have influence on how the teacher is paid , or if the teacher is fired .
k , but what does my name have the current discussion ?
And can you show where 'materialist/mechanist/positivist/darwinist/atheists ' ever said that humans were the only ones capable of altruism ?
So thats a problem of fundamentalism , and not a problem with the one creating the parody ? Apparently the creation of parodies for fundamentalism is a large part of atheism .
Just for those who also do n't know better . Not all who oppose abortion do so from a `` pro-life '' stance . Nor do we all come from a religious stance . Atheist and Agnostic Pro-Life League

I do n't know what point he was trying to make , but if the best you can do in liberal NYC is squeak out 51 % support , then gay marriage does n't have a chance nationally .
This all comes down to fear of retribution from gay people . They know that they have been the leading cause of our oppression , they know that the tide and culture is turning in our favor . Sometimes the oppressor finds in a minority it oppress a mirror of itself . They think it is right to oppress us and see can not see that we have no interest in oppressing them or even revenge for the oppression .
Why can you ? Are you making a statement that it 's reasonable to be irrational ?
You question whether intellectual property exists ? It is really property . It is a field of law . Studied at Berkley http : //www.law.berkeley.edu/institut ... 2/ipintro.html and at Columbus http : //faculty.cua.edu/fischer/Intro ... /IP % 20Home.htm In part regulated by Copyright http : //www.copyright.gov/ legislated around the world http : //www.worldlii.org/catalog/2296.html It is most strange that you do n't 'believe ' that it exists . It is just as real , in law as any other form of property , though it is not 'real property ' .
No , but they can change laws if they are unconstitutional . Them being irrelevant can however be played as a factor . Not an absolute one .
So you have a scumbag democrat screeching hate speech and we are supposed to believe its true ! Get real baby even you do n't believe this unless you have donated a vital organ associated with reasoning .
Because hopefully you 're going to shoot the guy , drop your gun , and put your hands out , not run around in circles waving it like a maniac for a a couple of minutes .
The attacker is usually armed in spite of gun control laws . All they do is disarm the law abiding . Not to mention the lack of enforcement on criminals .
Well that does make sense given that one would not expect you to understand environmental pressures on mutations if you ca n't even understand erosion . Would you expect someone to understand quantum physics if they could not even understand force ? No . Therefore [ u ] it predicts that one who does not understand some of the most basic things will not understand the complex . [ u ]
So you 're admitting openly that what is a normal occurrence within the human species is offensive to you . That you find repulsive the very intimacy expressed by your own parents that led to your own existence . Do you see how that innate bitterness against the normal and right feelings that have led to the healthy continuation of the human race is ultimately anti-humanity ? Why do you hate the normal propagation of our species Matt ? Ca n't you see that if you were given the power to recreate the world in your image , then the world would cease to exist within one generation ? No matter how pro-gay you are , how can you be so anti life in good conscience ?
Simple . The big government people will tell you that it 's in everybody 's best interest . The criminals will just kill you without debate .
Let 's not confuse our readers . supersport is not saying it 's evolution ; he 's saying that `` evolutionists '' say that it 's evolution . It should be clear now to the readers that scientists recognized perfectly well that this is an example of plasticity .

First , I think you may have misunderstood the `` pro-life mantra '' seeing how many pro-lifers think it permissable to disconnect life-support systems in certain circumstances , which necessarily results in a person 's death . But nevertheless , I think we agree that for purposes of the abortion discussion , it is a closer analogy to assume the violinst is only connected for nine months , and no longer than if we assume the violinist to be connected for some other arbitrary period of time . Am I correctly discerning an agreement on that ?
I shoulda worked for this guy when I had the chance . He goes on to say that Bush was the most fiscally irresponsible president we have had ... but Obama is threatening that title . This is something I have repeatedly said !

Just because it is human does n't mean it 's a human being . I 'm not sure what grade you 're in but that 's basic biology 101 . Your ears are human . Your ears are NOT human beings .

So I have the choice between staying safe and then claiming insurance damages , or risking my life to kill a burglar and ( likely ) cause damage to my own property in the process ? Somehow , I 'd rather stay safe . Better to lose my laptop than my life .

and thus a reason to support balanced reporting . true , there are indisputable facts . say 3000 died . but the interpretation of the facts are subjected to bias . the 3000 deserved to die as collaborators vs the 3000 were innocent and did not deserve to die .
Yes , a foetus is human , made of human cells , and possessing of DNA . However , it is no more a person than my kidney . Personhood implies mental existance , something foetuses do not have before the end of the 2nd trimester .
You mean your hypothetical I presume ? Murder violates the rights of the murdered by relieving them of their life . That 's why it 's illegal . You 're a bit slow I see .
Who cares ?
We accept plasticity , but we do not accept that plasticity can account for what has been attributed to mutations and natural selection . It has only been observed to change minor phenotypes ( shell thickness , type of bee ) . By the way , you have contended before that plasticity can cause a fish to change in response to predators ( which benefits the fish ) . Now , you are trying to say that life does n't evolve or change in any beneficial way . Cite your sources and make up your mind !
The Book of Genesis is either secular or observed history ? Somebody get marc a dictionary , please . ( And I 'd link him to a long list of observed instances of speciation , but he 'd ignore it yet again . )
Ummm , no . How could I possibly be forcing my beliefs on you when my view is for each person to have a choice . Your view is to force society to do away with all abortions .
Actually , scientists who discard the global flood are taken seriously .
I disagree , it depends on the nature of insult . `` You suck ! What kind of a dumb name is 'Robbie ' anyway ? '' Hardly requires a stretching of the old grey matter . But the snappy one-liner and the witty retort , or just a carefully crafted insult all require a fair amount of intelligence and insight . Flat out denial requires least thought . I.e . `` you 're wrong ! `` , `` you 're wrong 'cos God says so ! '' `` You 're wrong 'cos Dawkins says so !

There 's nothing magical in the word `` marriage . '' Just because one is called that does n't mean it 's any more legally superior than a `` marriage substitute '' ( as you call it ) . Splenda may not be called `` sugar '' , but at the end of the day ( or should I say the morning ) it still does just as good of a job sweetening the coffee . They 're both sweetners . Why should we change the composition of sugar just so you can say the sweetner-composition YOU want is termed 'sugar ? '
The article said very little about his observations and almost nothing about his methods .

Actually , it is . There are multitudes of known characteristics that have been shown to be the result of a single point difference in the gene . The discovery of regulatory functions of some translated segments of DNA does not in any way discount what is known about gene function .

Utter XXXX . Doctors will regularly provide advice on lifestyle changes to those at risk of a variety of diseases and conditions , contact information as to where they can find support in making those lifestyle changes , and if appropriate refer them to psychologists to assist them in making those changes . Dentists will give long lectures on the evils of eating sugar and suggest appropriate snack replacements for sugary foods . What else does `` walking the walk '' entail ? Should the `` medical establishment '' follow their patients around and forcibly prevent them from having a lifestyle they believe to be harmful ?

Sure looks like he personally caused or ordered quite a few abortions . That 's not to mention all the infanticide and child killing ( if you want those verses I 'll be happy to post them - over twenty of them ) and the genocide he has done . God has directly killed more people than can be attributed to Satan in the Bible ( going by what the Bible descrines , satan only directly caused about 10 deaths as opposed to God 's over 2 million murders ) . Oh , and , sorry Phyllis , but these ones ARE very clearly abortion .

Well , your typical diety is generally immortal , omnipotent or nearly so , all knowing or nearly so , and concerned with humanity in some way . Creating the universe is a bonus , but not required . They 're all described as living outside the world , but being able to interact with it . Whatever their relationship with our universe is , it 's clearly outside the realm of science as we know it . What does this mean in terms of proving their existence ? Since their interactions with us are outside the realm of science , science ca n't really say anything unless the dieties in question specifically choose to interact with us in a way which science could verify . That is to say , the existence of any God ca n't be proven against that God 's will , but I believe that if a diety wanted to have it 's existence known than it would certainly be able to do so .
So how come you automatically qualify and we do n't ? What makes you better than us ?
`` The '' ? There is no single interpretation of the ToE . There is a debate going on between supporters of Punctuated Equilibrium and Gradualism , for example . It does n't matter that this website asserts that this one interpretation is accepted .

( Of course , the websites that are not unclear do n't often support your point of view ... )
Well I 'm pretty sure if it was cyber-enhancements then that dog never would have been born for you to see . It would be in a lab somewhere . You are right that it is possible that this is the case , but over time you would have found out about it assuming the dog was born for you to see indicating there is no cover-up or secret made of it and you would learn all about it in the future . A year goes by , scientists say it was genuine evolution . Would that be enough evidence ?
That I have failed to prove it at all is only according to the atheist worldview . A neutral , agnostic worldview may think they are somewhat comparable . The Judeo Christian worldview that is taught to many students by their parents would think that evolution ( happenstance origins ) is n't in any way close to ID . So we have two one sided worldviews , and one neutral one . Since a free exploration of ideas would give students the most complete picture , would interfere less with altering their worldviews that were most likely formed in the home , and would be most likely to teach them HOW to think , why are we dangerously close ( thanks John Jones ) to allowing one - one sided worldview to completely suppress another worldview in the science classroom ? The answer of course , is politics . Science has become more and more politicized as the domestic federal government grows larger and larger . The government that once had limited powers has become more and more discoverers of emergencies and crisies , that entitle us all , particularly organizations , to a share of federal pie . Science has gladly hopped on board - they have the measuring devices , the microscopes and telescopes . In 1989 , the budget of the National Institutes of Health was $ 7.9 billion . In 2005 it 's $ 28.8 billion . This is one of many government agencies that science `` serves '' , and others have fat budgets as well . Leaf through Science magazine and you 'll see that the maintanance of government spending on science is one of it 's biggest preoccupations . To maintain it , science peddles hope and fear . Of course , some say that religion peddles the same thing . Science would rather not compete with it , and it certainly does n't help when the new concept of ID , armed with the latest scientific discoveries , comes along questioning established scientific `` theories '' that keep them at the highest rung of the hope and fear ladder . It used to be that religion and science did n't compete , and they should n't today . But they do , and there 's only one difference from yesterday and today - government money .

Actually they are what make us animals . It 's the DNA that determines that this particular animal will be a human . There is no precise definition as to what it is that makes someone a person . An in-fetu fetus are not a person IMO even though they may well have a brain , nervous system and organs .
So you 've never repeated a sin ?
But it is n't an assertion of absolute truth . It is actually an assertion of the consensus of current scientific thought . I have read some discussion about various other possibilities . Maybe several forms of life arose in various environments . Eventually they then had to compete for resourses and all but one went extinct . And then there is the hypothesis that life arose more than once and fused into a single population . The bottom line is that the DNA code is universal with only a few minor differences in a limited number of primative organisms .

wrong again , only 154 justifiable homicides out of thousands of murders * In 2005 , 30,694 people in the United States died from firearm-related deaths  12,352 were murdered ; 17,002 killed themselves ; 789 were accidents ; 330 died by police intervention , and in 221 , the intent was unknown . 6 In comparison , 33,651 Americans were killed in the Korean War and 58,193 Americans were killed in the Vietnam War.7 * An additional 71,417 people were shot and survived their injuries -- 52,748 people injured in an attack ; 3,190 people injured in a suicide attempt ; 14,678 people shot accidentally , and 801 people shot in a police intervention.8 * In 2004 , firearms were used to murder 56 people in Australia , 184 people in Canada , 73 people in England and Wales , 5 people in New Zealand , and 37 people in Sweden.9 In comparison , firearms were used to murder 11,344 in the United States.10 * In 2006 , there were only 154 justifiable homicides by private citizens using handguns in the United States.11 * For every time a gun is used in a home in a legally-justifiable shooting [ note that every self-defense is legally justifiable ] there are 22 criminal , unintentional , and suicide-related shootings.17 * The presence of a gun in the home triples the risk of homicide in the home.18 * The presence of a gun in the home increases the risk of suicide fivefold.19
I 'm sorry , I thought you were a `` fundamentalist '' . You said that you believe everything that the Bible says , correct ? Then how do you explain God taking a rib out of Adam 's side to create Eve ? Lurch just showed you that it was `` scientifically '' impossible .

Well , the first part is true but I 'm not sure I understand what you are saying in the second part . Science does not claim that intelligent design is false because science lacks the tools to examine the concept . ID is just another unsupported assertion outside the domain of science ( and logic for that matter ) . ID has reached the stage of unsupported assertion without evidence . Science has better explanations .
I 'm not saying it 's the `` right thing '' to do , it 's just the sort of thing that a desperate father might do to save the reputation of his daughter . I mean , we live in a Christian nation and we still kind of think , in our heart of hearts , that if a woman or girl is raped IT 'S HER FAULT .
Oh , we do n't have to - sorry , I was n't clear enough there . What I 'm trying to do is correct your misapprehensions concerning common descent . You said this :
In reality , there are no concrete 'reasons ' for believing in God . If you believe in God , you believe based on faith . There is no incontrovertible physical evidence anywhere to even suggest that God exists ... unless you first believe through faith that God exists .
Well this does n't answer my question though . With this bill , where is the money coming from ? Are we cutting doctors jobs ? I hate to use a Krugman thing but this looks like an `` underpants gnomes '' theory . 1 ) Pass Senate Bill 2 ) ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 3 ) Save $ 3,000 per capita .

And it still took an entire month for that whole division of well armed nazi soldiers to defeat a group of holdout jewish citizens , who were poorly armed compared to the nazis . Yes they ultimately lost , but the ghetto residents were so hard to beat it took a month to flush them out .

I think the only valid reason for owning a gun is because you want to . Every person ( with some exceptions ) has the right to keep and bear arms , why you do it is your own business . Giving specific reasons for gun ownership is the top of a slippery slope towards banning certain firearms . While I have specific reasons for owning specific guns , to include hunting , I own some of my guns for no other reason than they are fun to shoot . A humorus side note : I own one gun strictly for fishing , sounds odd but its common practice ( at least in Alaska ) to shoot large Halibut before bringing them aboard .
Spoken like a true man .
Actually , qualified biologists know no such thing . In fact , I 've never known one who would agree with that assertion . Can you give us some peer reviewed references to support your assertion ?
And all having a real , verifiable negative impact on society , which can not be said about gay marriage . Can we tone down the drama a little bit ?
This is obviously not talking about abortion .
You know what ? You 're officially too clueless to post on this thread . You obviously have n't bothered yourself to figure out what 's going on , so I 'm going to kindly ask that you leave until you figure out what is going on . As I escort you out the door ( metaphorically ) , let me just repeat something for you that was in the FIRST SENTENCE of the article that you obviously could n't be bothered to read ... I 'll even make it nice and big so maybe it will help with your reading comprehension ! collect detailed data about each abortion performed -- and post it all on a public Web site . Feel free to rejoin us when you figure out what 's going on .

That does n't work , sorry . The speed of light through space is constant , that 's why a light year can be used as a measure of distance .
Oh boy , trying to tie Bayesian statistics to the number of assumptions ! Nowhere in Bayesian analysis is there a term for number of assumptions . Once again you are trying to tie number of assumptions to the correctness of a hypothesis . There is no such connection . It does n't exist . In science , you only use data to evaluate hypotheses . In Bayesian analysis , each study represents more DATA , not a change in assumptions .
and the pro-choicers claim pro-lifers appeal to emotion too much . Nevertheless , I think the embryos would probably be dead if they were just sitting on a counter somewhere so you then save the child .
Actually , it 's because I fail to understand you point . You have n't actually presented any rational evidence to support your view . In fact , you are quite comical . Is n't it funny how I am brainwashed because I am willing to accept new data , while you , who clings to dogmatic mythology are open minded . [ quote ] The sun is setting on ToE . [ quote ] Such has been the claim for decades .
That is not quite what the 'mitochondrial Eve ' hypothesis posits . Science . 1995 Dec 22 ; 270 ( 5244 ) :1930-6 . The myth of Eve : molecular biology and human origins . Ayala FJ . University of California , Irvine , USA . It has been proposed that modern humans descended from a single woman , the `` mitochondrial Eve '' who lived in Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago . The human immune system DRB1 genes are extremely polymorphic , with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago , a time before the divergence of the apes from the Old World monkeys . The theory of gene coalescence suggests that , throughout the last 60 million years , human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater . Molecular evolution data favor the African origin of modern humans , but the weight of the evidence is against a population bottleneck before their emergence . The mitochondrial Eve hypothesis emanates from a confusion between gene genealogies and individual genealogies .
I suppose the fact that Indian law only applies to its people . Who qualifies as an Indian is another matter . Many people who have as little as one-tenth Indian blood qualify for liberal hunting privileges here in Minnesota .
Nearly all the food humans eat today , even in the Western world is GM including maize , tomatoes , and soy , etc , etc . used as ingredients in products such some soymilk . Essentially everything is with the exception of `` organic '' . However , as i noted above , I would n't make this argument because I think GM soy esecially is not very healthy for people snd GM foods tend to be more prone to bacterial infection which can make people sick . I have n't read from all sides , however .
Yes there is a reason to opposing it . It is called religion . There is no reason to oppose gambling , but people do . There is no reason to oppose sex , but people do . There is no reason to oppose drinking but people do . And I am not talking drinking and driving or having sex with a disease like aids .
But what you are being challenged to do is to give some evidence for the idea that the world was created less than 10,000 years ago . In other words , `` If Genesis-style creation were true , we would expect to see ( fill in the blank ) . ''
The observable universe represents an event horizon , outside of which we can not see . The actual extent of the universe beyond that is at present unknowable . Current versions of M-theory hold that our universe was formed from the collisions of branes in a higher dimension .
Well , you ignored the part where I said `` voting '' . But IMO legislative solutions ARE part and parcel to popular appeal because legislators are voted in on that basis . ANY legislator claims to `` do what 's right . '' So elections tend to be popularity contests . And legislators tend to want to keep their constituents happy . Oh and just to make sure you understand this Kronos so as not to get off in the wrong direction , this is my opinion , just like everything else I 've said . It is not a lie .
deliberate acts of fabrication to produce false and fradulent claims as to what others have said . You cited my posts which did not imply anything of the sort you claimed it did and what I thought . In fact , some of the cited refute such claims .
Just common sense . If a mutation provides some benefit , it tends to be retained . Over time , ( sometimes over a very short time ) this can produce a new structure as we see in this case .
Agreed , which tells me that spending $ Trillions on an uncertainty of this magnitude has to be driven by alterior motives .
Same evidence , different interpretations based on different starting faiths . We will use the Lucy type skeleton and the next supposed evolutionary progression Homo Hablis ( for short hand , HH ) . CAT scans of the inner ear of HH showed that the semi-circular cannals , which determine balance and locomotion , are more like those of baboons than those of humans . This is not what one would expect if the evolutionary story about human origins is true , HH should be more bipedal than the Lucy type skeleton from which it supposedly evolved from , but it is not . In fact , most scientists now think that HH is not one creature , but instead is several types of creatures that do not belong together , at least three or more different animals , hence making it an invalid category . Further more , it can not be our ancestor as no such animal ever existed . Hence , the evidence is interpreted more sensibly and reasonable through a creationary model . This is just an example of what they may do with some fossils , IMVHO .
Well if you 're going to quote that article that mentions Canada to support your opinion , then does that mean you 're in favor of gun registration and licensing ? Canada has them . And if the NRA is really interested in enforcing laws why do they ask congress to reduce the budget of law enforcement ? The NRA uses its political muscle to make it easier for criminals to obtain guns . Robert Ricker , former top lawyer of the NRA , talks about it .
by this stupidity a KKK mob with guns is a militia !
Really , where did I say that ? From a psychological point of view it is interesting that you should read that into what I said . It 's akin to the argument that if I debate against one thing in science I must be 'anti-science ' . ( Note : with regards 'The Cross ' you were unhappy to be labelled anti-Christian when you debated against one particular thing - the Cross - you should know how I feel ) But the nationalist science theory of the poster I addressed struck my interest because he tied it in to a specific series of events ; the space race . Even more specifically , the fact that the Soviets beat you . ( Note : They also beat you in putting a woman into space , and also in having a 'space-walk ' ) And it seems that the blame for this is twofold a ) the poor teaching of science and b ) religious people I would like to know - when you talk of 'advantage ' what do you mean . Advantage in what way ? Are you going to respond with more projection ? Or am I not allowed to comment ? It 's funny it 's the 'how dare a non-science person comment on science ' .
What I am trying to point out is that it seemed like you jumped from the term `` punish '' to accusing me of not believing that God would take an aborted child to Heaven . It did n't seem like a logical jump . I know what you meant , but I did n't see the connection .
People make mistakes ( excepting some pro-evolutionists who respond with anger and blame others of 'twisting their words ' . )
Yes Chrstians should be disarmed so the `` moral '' atheists , humanists , pagans who crucified people should rule over us . . . that would give everyone a warm fuzy feeling inside . Matt 26 : 1 And it happened , when Jesus finished all these sayings , He said to His disciples , 2 You know that the Passover is coming after two days , and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified . Of course there are valid reasons why Christ armed His men . Romans 13 : 1 Let every soul be subject to higher authorities , for there is no authority except from God , but the existing authorities have been ordained by God . 2 So that the one resisting authority has opposed the ordinance of God , and the ones opposing will receive judgment to themselves . 3 For the rulers are not a terror to good works , but to the bad . And do you desire not to fear the authority ? Do the good , and you will have praise from it ; 4 for it is a servant of God to you for the good . But if you practice evil , be afraid ; for he does not bear the sword in vain ; for he is a servant of God , an avenger for wrath to the one practicing evil . 5 Because of this , it is necessary to be subject , not only on account of wrath , but also on account of conscience . 6 For on this account you also pay taxes , for they are ministers of God , always giving attention to this very thing . 7 Then give to all their dues : to the one due tax , the tax ; to the one due tribute , the tribute ; to the one due fear , the fear ; to the one due honor , the honor . Luke 11 : 21 When the strong one , having been armed , guards his dwelling , his goods are in peace . 22 But as soon as one stronger than he comes , he overcomes him ; he takes away his armor on which he relied , and deals out his arms . `` a moments notice ... '' Well it appears the guaranteed scheduled time is on the day of judgment . Luke 19 : 27 But these enemies of mine , those not desiring me to reign over them , bring them here and execute them before me .
Yes , but the statement directly contradicts proponents of `` creation science '' and of ID . Their claim is that they are doing science , even though they ca n't show how . Scientists have claimed all along that creationists/IDers are doing philosophy and religion , but not science . That is the problem . They never offer any evidence that supports their assertions , only mythology and superstition . But now we have Ray admitting that creationism and ID are not science and ca n't be included in science . They either philosophy or theology , but not science .
I 'd be curious if Berkowitz studied whether a sword or club produced the same effect as a firearm ? Short of castrating all boys at the onset of puberty , I 'm afraid boys will be boys .
Well , the people in Iraqu that we are killing are terrorists that just want to make chaos so they can come to power in the confution . We also went to war to remove Saadam from power . He killed 200,000 people . most of them were tortured to death . So yes it makes more sense to kill terrorists that are trying to kill as many people as possible than to kill little children that have not been born . Besides , babies are so cute
Yes , with a crime rate larger than New York City , Chicago , Philadelphia , San Francisco , Los Angeles , Indianapolis , and Las Vegas , they 're a wonderful example to follow , are n't they ?
Ho ho ho .
So why did we spend 600 billion on the Iraq war ?
11/30/03 Some undesirable consequences of New York City 's gun control laws Gee Wiz Brady , now you are reaching all the way back to 2003 ? You are indeed a strange bird !
No - it 's not . Your stand on rape victims proves it .
Well that was a lovely story and cudos on working in the anti-war angle . No , the 50 or more GIANT posters in a row alongside a public ( taxpayer funded ) roadway do not affect me personaly in any way from a shock perspective . As I said , I am strongly against abortion , I have seen the same pictures many times before . My complaint is the virtual forcing of all citizens to view the photos as they drive down a public roadway , and the harrassing of motorists at stop lights . Mainly my point in posting this thread was to try to find out if this was a common type of anti-abortion protest in other parts of the country . I 'm quite sure many other `` conservatives '' will view this type of protest as a wonderful thing . I think it actually works against the anti-abortion movement and alienates potential supporters .
And where exactly is your proof that `` Stop , do n't touch , leave the area , tell an adult '' is indoctrination and translates to `` go out and buy a gun , buy as many guns as possible , obsess over the gun , etc . ''
Your continued comparison of a person exercising their constitutional rights , to engaging in deviant and possibly illegal sexual acts , has reached the point of intolerance , Smith . Every time you mention the word fetish , you 're gon na be reported . So unless you wan na get banned cut it out .

Actually the Bible has changed , not to mention had omissions .
You seem fairly intelligent . However , it is you who seems `` highly confused '' over the definition of murder . You see , you are speaking in terms of legal jargon as it is applied inside a particular country . I 'm referring to the moral implications of taking the life of a defenseless person without its consent . I might have better represented my argument to you by stating : we will never know with absolute certainty whether or not am unborn human constitutes a person , and thus whether or not aborting them constitutes killing them , i.e . murder in a strictly moral , and not political , sense . In response to your attacking on my saying we are glad we were n't aborted , yeah it has no bearing on my argument and I put it in for fun . Good for you to spot it .
Oh , it was going so well too
And they are wrong .
Actually , the reason people dismiss the concept of a diety is often not because of 'lies ' , but because there is no objective evidence of any diety what so ever .
When did you choose to be heterosexual ? If sexual orientaion is a chioce then I dare you choose to be gay here and now .
again , please review the definition of an atheist humor can not be observed by apparatus that test the physical realm . it is an abstract and intangible quality . so is beauty , artistic ability and pleasure . yet these things exist and are as real to an atheist as it is to a theist . an atheist does not need a devine revelation to appreciate intangible qualities or account for their existence . they can be detected through mental processing , and communicated so that others can agree on the quality and identify it when it is present . being an atheist does not preclude belief in the existence of intangible and abstract things . it just precludes the belief in god and a spiritual/supernatural realm
1 . No , but my Mom was , and my Sis was and my Wife was . To the good fortune of my Brothers and Sis 'n me and my nieces and my kids , we all were welcomed into the world . Mom said that I was one more kid than she had hoped for but that she let me live anyway . I really appreciate it too . 2 . 1/4th . My wife of course was the expert . She was magnificent as she raised them kids . I did a good job of providing and stuff that dads do too . I used to take my little girl dove hunting with me . I 'd shoot dove , she 'd run out and fetch them . She 'd have them cleaned by the time she got back to me . My son , could embarrass me when shooting and outfish me every time . He did n't like that I made him clean all the fish either . They turned out to be great people . 3 . Yes Ma am . Myself . I have no dead bodies in my past . You ?
We can add to this list , Singin 's desire of criminalizing gun owners who do n't report gun thefts in a required time and to lock up all guns in a manner that will prevent thefts . He of course says that does not mean jail , but aiding and abetting and straw sales already require serious jail time . and straw sales is already a Federal Offense with either 5 or 10 year jail terms . So we are talking about Very Serious jail terms regardless of what Sinjin might say in order to sell the idea . And one more thing the Anti-gun forces want but wo n't say it now .
Yes the facts speak for themselves , they just do n't sing the song you think they do . No biologist will find any need at all to wave any hands in this instance , for as you say the facts DO speak for themselves .
You know , considering how little ray knows about science , do you think we could write a creationist load of **** and take these XXXXXX for all their money ?
So the Kerry campaign paid them 4 years ago ? The transcript is from 2000. http : //www.truthtree.com/Censorship/posts/141.html
( Playing devil 's advocate ) And , by what authority would you deny a woman 's `` right to choose '' an abortion that happens to be `` late in her pregnancy ? ''
Such as what ? It is not like putting two electrodes into the Earth and getting a measurement on some sort of gadget . The only way to measure how old something is , is by using a set of arbitrary assumptions . There are few things that you need to take into account , such as the rate of decay , and so on . Creationists know that there is something seriously wrong with the radio-metric dating methods . Explain this then , carbon dating of wood under lava that was erupted from Rangitoto ( an island volcano near Auckland , NZ ) indicates that the erruption was around 200 years ago ( the name is said to mean `` Red Sky '' , suggesting that the Maoris , who have been their for 1000 years at the most , witnessed this event ) . Yet potassium-argon dating of the lava rock has given ages of up to half a million years old ! Now this alone is a big flaw . Any person who uses their logic can tell that the result of the potassium-argon is way out , it should be less than 200 years . The radio-carbon date is only restricted to thousands of years , because even after several hundreds of thousands of years , there will be no more radio-carbon left . The above came from Snelling , A. , `` Dating Dilemma : Fossil wood in `` ancient '' sandstone '' , Creation 21 ( 3 ) :39-41 . Creationists do n't have ( by their own admissions ) all of the answers when it comes to radio-metric dating methods , but they can see enough that there is something seriously wrong with the underlying assumptions . Professor Richard Mauger says : `` In general , dates in the `` correct ball park '' are assumed to be correct and are published , but those in disagreement with other data are seldom published nor are discrepencies fuly explained . ''
At least you are aware of your own mental deficiencies .
In my lifetime , we 've made huge strides , but there 's a lot more to learn .
What else is new ?
But on the other hand , Genesis is n't a scientific document . No wonder . Why would a bronze age nomad from the Levant be aware of at least 3 tailless species of primates , or even the tailed primates from Africa , South America , and even Madigascar . If they are n't mentioned in the Bible , do they exist ?
Well , I forgot to add one thing : a legal notice to the gov't about such behavior .
Yes , that 's all true , and it makes complete sense . But in doing this , the Court may have created a situation where plaintiffs can argue that California is denying people the equal protection of the laws , by allowing some people to be married to same-sex spouses and not allowing other people to be so married . If that is the argument that the plaintiffs make in their federal lawsuit , this could be interesting . The courts might have to interpret whether allowing some people to be married and not allowing other people to be married violates the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the U.S. constitution . And then they might have to decide whether this means that all same-sex couples must have the right to marry , because some of them can be legally married . In other words , this situation may be an opportunity , because no one can argue that this is a case of apples and oranges of same-sex couples being different from opposite-sex couples . Now you have same-sex couples who are legally married and same-sex couples who can not be legally married in the same state , which can be argued to be denial of equal protection of the laws . I do n't know ... .it could be interesting . Maybe things wo n't play out this way . We 'll have to wait and see .
But the government ca n't work with connotative meanings . It has to go by what is written . In this case , the definition of murder by every source I have read states that murder is the killing of another human .
... ? Either you 've misread what I said , twisted what I said , or you 're just stupid .
Leonard Peikoff said it first
Oh no . The main disagreement between theistic evolutionists and Fundmentalists is that Fundies are n't worshipping God , but a false idol of their own making .
I see . The your god is an imperfect god that learns from experience and makes decisions based on that learning . Your god needed many attempts to reach the culmination of creation . By the way , how do you know that god is n't still creating other forms of life ? Why do you believe that imperfect mankind is the culmination . Maybe your god is just pausing while trying to figure out improvements .
And your analysis is flat out lacking . What everyone else seems to realize is that the reason Obama won is because of FAR higher turnout , many by African American voters . ( Who more tend to be ... taa daa ! ... Democrats ! ) There is definitely a considerable discrepancy in Obama supporters and gay marriage supporters . Of that , there can be no doubt . And your anaysis of the FL situation is completely removed from reality . FL requires a vote of over 60 % for an amendment to pass . It would n't pass at 59 % , let alone 50 . So not only do you demonstrate a lack of even knowing what was needed there , it does n't even fit as an apt comparison .
Open carry is gaining momentum in Michigan , so who knows ? And the I smell posers comment ... well , I 'll just say that I think you 're jumping to a premature conclusion . I 'm catching up on this thread and have a few more pages to go , but I wanted to address this comment before I go on . Most of us who openly carry in Michigan , are licensed to conceal , but we are carrying openly to promote the concept . Let me note that I , too , believe that openly carrying an unloaded firearm is asking for trouble . I ca n't see how it could make any situation safer , with it taking seconds to load a gun and get it into battery . Luckily we carry loaded here , which drastically changes the dynamics . When one can go from either concealment or a side holstered weapon to putting holes in a center mass in under a second , that 's an effective deterrent . Then we hear the `` gun grab '' argument - if you 're openly carrying , anyone could grab your gun . This just is n't practical . If a criminal wants a gun , h'es going to B & amp ; E a house or obtain it by other means than trying to take it off of someone who 's wearing one . There 's just too big a chance of getting shot . Not to mention that when someone is openly carrying , they generally have a heightened state of awareness . We pay more attention to what 's going on around us . Another hitch in that argument is equipment . Most who OC , like me , have retention holsters . They `` lock '' the gun into place in the holster and a button must be pressed to draw the weapon . Therefore , someone would n't be able to just sneak up and pull the weapon from its holster . Criminals traditionally go for easy targets . If Joe is visibly armed and Pete is n't , which would be the more likely victim ? If a thug walks into a C-store with ill intentions and sees a customer or two armed , I can say with certainty that the thug will wait until the store 's empty or pick another location . Carrying openly can be an effective crime deterrent , and seeing armed good guys here and there is a constant reminder to the criminal element that we ( , the People ) are taking arms and proactively defending ourselves . Just bear these things in mind before jumping on the `` open carry is crazy '' bandwagon .
Is this Happy from the anehiem board ? ! ? ! ?
And you call this warped opinion of yours evidence of anything ? As usual you make blanket condemnations while proving nothing at all .
He did n't erase all evidence . We have the Bible account . In fact , we 've got accounts from heaps of different cultures all around the world . We 've got cultures from all over who have a memory of what happened , and despite this , no one believes them .
Its amazing how the facts are in front of thier faces yet they still claim they are only for `` Reasonable '' gin control laws .
Are you trying to make an argument against gun ownership , or just testosterone ?
Oh ! You mean how it 's a tail during the earlier stages of fetal develop -- Ah , now I see . That was supposed to be the trick . Sorry Electrolyte , but that was not a funny joke .
Oh , so is your God the Chinese government ? Honestly , most atheists will say people believe in God because they ca n't think for themselves and must rely on something in order to exist . Where 's the difference ? The Chinese follow the Chinese government like puppy dogs because they ca n't think for themselves , and they rely on the government in order to survive .
And reproduction rates are not uniform among a population . Do n't let him bait you into following his unstated assumptions . However , I must say that those are fine examples of competition within populations . Good work . Same with `` artificial '' ( or at least , not exactly natural ) selection .
2 , A . Myth ; Complete fabrication .
Then argue with yourself . Why bother having others answer for themselves
In science , a scientific method actually exists . There is no scientific method in creationism . Religion can not use the scientific method .
So umm . What 's going on ? This was posted a week ago plus about 4 hours ago . I frankly do n't care if my opponent posts a day late and would hate to win because of time . BUT the first post was even easier , he could have been typing it as we found judges and I think he mentioned he had started already . I PMed him earlier this week reminding him of the limit and have not recieved a response . Of course maybe the fact that he has n't logged on since 11/14 has something to do with that .
Actually ... I do believe there ARE laws against people wearing masks in public . IIRC , some locations even have laws against adults wearing masks in public on Halloween . But , as to the story ... Yes , cops are IGNORANT and DO LIE ALL THE TIME . But , what 's new ? As for a trunk loaded with assault rifles ... I 've done that several times . Just not to an airport . I hope he sues the city and I also hope he ( or someone else ) takes CA 's anti-gun laws to the supreme court .
Unions fought to keep children out of work for the same reason they fought to keep blacks and women out of work - they want a monopoly on employment .
And the mother has not done anything to be forced to give birth .
It has to do with freedom and equality but then again I do not expect non empathic people to understand that . Looking at you answers below I would have though you would understand the concept that I get to choose who I share my life with , who I transfer my property too and who I call family . You do not understand that the government says to everyone who is a family by the issuance of that piece of legal paper . The in equality part comes in when I am told that I can not have that piece of paper but some hetero can because someone else has a religious belief that should have no effect on my life what so ever . I am saying that if so religious XXXXX wants to force their religion on me by using that religion as an excuse for the state not issuing me that piece of paper then I want a say in their life and want the government to remove that belief . If the religious XXXXXX stay out of my life then I will stay out of theirs but if they want to get involved in my life then I want to get involved in theirs . EYE FOR AN EYE equality by its very definition . You want the government out of your life and I want religion out of my government and my life .
Yep ...
Yes , I 've noticed that . I do think part of the problem is that he has n't bothered to get educated in the subject . From the arguments I 've seen from him over the time he 's been here he seems to rely on YEC websites for information , and when he gets to something he does n't know it seems like he cuts-and-pastes ( often without fuly reading ) from google ( leading to the Civil War Dinosaur fiasco and the Nazca stones fiasco ) that seems to support his views
More silliness on your part . Think about it . Gay couples together for 40 or 50 years . That means they were living together in the 1950s and 1960s . Those people were the foundation of the gay-pride movement .
What does spelling have to do with your own opinion ? Again this is n't just about you although I think you did resort to correcting someone 's spelling and just did n't answer the question . This has nothing to do with being entitled to your own opinion . It is equally bad for anyone to resort to personal attacks on either side of the debate .
What would be the point in doing that when they are all based on evolution . This argument wont ever end because neither creationism nor evoluionism can be proved as fact . Its always gon na just be a battle between beliefs . Telling him to read that is just you trying to convince him of ur beliefs but at the same time he 's doing the same thing with u . There is no sense in suggesting such things .
Yep when about 99.99 % of a cows diet is grass ... I guess we should be eating that instead . It is hard to urinate in one corner of the toilet . If all ground that is being used for livestock is `` wonderfully transformed '' into grain production there will be many many wild species that will go extinct due to lack of uncultivated land .
And the resemblance of the bill of a platypus to that of a duck is superficial . You do n't actually try to learn the basic facts about anything before you speak out , do you ?
But , now here 's the thing , what about the peole with unwanted babies are n't good people . In my opinion , the vast majority unwanted babies are n't from good people . A good woman having an unwanted baby is a completely diffeent case , but , as I said , it does n't often occur that a good woman has an unwanted baby .
Just because you do n't hold the same beliefs as we do , does not invalidate our belief . I feel sorry for you if all you have to believe in is a small petri dish of algae . You do need absolute proof if your going claim it as the only possible way of creation .
Public policy protects us -or at least attempts to- from really unhealthy foods through nutritional information labels . People who choose to eat unhealthy foods do so despite knowing that doing so may lead to health problems . Besides being careful not to get into situations where you are likely to be shot , people do n't have much control over whether or not someone pulls a gun on them , and that is why most people are more afraid of being killed by someone else 's gun than their own eating habits .
Just liike Stalin
Well , you could try actually reading the second of my two links - there 's three relevant sources provided in that post , one of which cites a further two studies . 'Baseless ' and 'wild ' , it ai n't .
And down the road abit do n't be surprised if you see Sunday Blue Laws being enacted to enforce worship on Sunday ! All in the name of giving man a rest from toil of course !
Actually , it got combined with an entry with a whole bunch of other 'laws ' at List of eponymous laws - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia It 's still there .
But it is part of the woman 's body because it 's dependant on her . Eventually it will be a person , but it 's still part of the woman 's body because it is totally dependant on her body . Saying that this is false is imposing other peoples ' morals ( that it 's a life before it 's born ) on someone else rather than giving the woman the choice about her body and allowing her to decide whether she wants to go through pregnancy and have a baby or not . That 's the pro-choice argument . I agree that as science progresses , we can reach a compromise .
Oh ! I get it ! abortion is fun , it is only a traumatic experience ( to kill your unborn son/daughter ) for `` unbalanced '' women
Yes that actually did happen . And knowing our nanny state government where anything that could cause harm is banned we have it banned . BTW do any of you know of some great airsoft fields over in USA ?
Everyone expects that . What they do n't and should n't have to expect is that they will be specifically targeted and have to pay more , be penalised more , etc . than hetero couples such as yourself or me and my husband .
But that is a misunderstanding of what the big bang theory is . What it is n't is an explosion . I do n't suppose you have actually studied any astrophysics or astronomy upon which you base your rejection of the big bang , have you ?
Actually the Bible/creation makes quite a lot predictions that science has recently verified . Some examples include : that the Earth is round ( Isa . 40:22 ) ; the Earth is suspended in space without support ( Job 26:7 ) ; sea currents ; the hydrologic cycle ; the first and second laws of thermodynamics ( e.g . Isa 51:6 ) ; and the fact that Orion cluster is seperating and that the Pleadies cluster is staying together as a group ( Job 38:31 ) ; and many others . Since there was a global flood according to the Bible , we would expect there to be many fossils rapidly despoited and this is what we see in some parts of the fossil record . For example , there are some fossil beds are found in sedimentary rock , deposited by water so rapidly as to bury some creatures while still giving birth and eating food . Creationists have also made predictions such as the fact that there can be variation with in a kind , but one kind can not change into other kinds . This is what we observe now in the present , and is backed up by the fossil record . We would expect that many rocks , such as Uluru in Australia , would not be `` ordered in layers '' . Once again , this is what we observe . Creationists predicted that mutations and natural selection are down hill processes , i.e . information losing . We would also expect everything to be running down , we might also expect to know that some dinosaurs survived the flood but most likely died in the ice age that followed the flood . Several cultural groups have given very descriptive information about dinosaur like creatures . Remember , they would not have had a picture book with dinosaurs in it , the Aboriginal 's for example , had paintings of dinosaur like creatures in caves ; the amazing amount of design and complexity in the universe ; Laws of Nature . Also many other predictions . So as you can see , creationists have made many predictions ( as has the Bible ) and all are 100 % scientificly correct . IF , if such fossils are found and they are obviously transitional , then that would certainly aid the evolutionist case . But evolution is supposed to have millions of transitional fossils , they have a hand full of highly debatable ones . Btw , I am not trying to impress you by any means of your imagination . If I wanted to impress someone I could stay here and away from the internet . It is just that `` evolution '' is not as `` scientific '' as you may think .
Dude , I already said I considered numerous things , so I do n't know why you keep complaining about this .
So , whether the embryo/fetus/whatever-you-want-to-call-it has rights seems to be a non-issue . Because , for pro-choice folk , even if it has rights , it still is preferable to ensure that it can be legally killed . Of course , it is obvious to everyone that an entity does not need rights in order to have legal protections . But I 'll let that slide for now .
Okay Yankee Fan . Keep pretending that it does n't . Well , if you never read the article , you would n't be pretending as that would be an argument from position of ignorance .
And what would that prove ? It would certainly show that an animal adapted to survival above the Arctic circle was not adapted to the Arizona desert . Maybe it would indicate that the environmental conditions necessary for the change are n't present in Arizona . How is that relevant to evolutionary theory ?
Since we have observed it happening in the case of the nylon bug , it can not be the obstacle you presume It 's easy to get lost in abstract concerns about 'information ' . For instance , imagine a lock with a three-digit code , like those on briefcases . It 's easy to get in if you know the code , but it 's also perfectly possible to get in without knowing the code - it just takes longer . If you 're right about the way information works , that ought n't to be possible . The crucial point is that the lock contains all the information required to open it . That information is transferred to the person trying to open it via feedback : when you get the right code , the case opens . If there was no feedback - if the person was not actually opening the case themselves but was just blindly shouting numbers for someone else to try with no idea if it was working or not - they would be none the wiser . Similarly , the nylon waste products metabolised by the nylon bug intrinsically possess all the necessary information concerning how they can be broken down . That information is transferred to the bacteria via the feedback of natural selection : the bugs who hit upon the right combination survive , and those who do not , perish . In this manner information about how to survive in the present environment is transferred from the environment and encoded in the genome . No information is being created , it is merely being moved around .

George Bush won the majority of votes ( the first majority winner in 16 years ) in an election with the highest turnout in US history ( > 117Million voters ) . The Senate Minority Leader was defeated by a nobody . Democrats lost at least 3 seats in each of the House and Senate , something that never happens in a Presidential election year . This gave the Republican majority in both branches of Congress even more control . 11 Liberal ballot initiatives went down in flames by huge margins . If liberalism IS N'T dead , then it 's in ICU on a heart and lung machine .

And so on . Yes . a lie generated by creationist liars is what you use as source for what scientists are claimed to adhere to ? Your dishonesty is actually rather startling . This is the worst attempt at dishonesty I have seen from lying creationists yet , and your gleeful introduction of that lie shows how truly and completely dishonest you are . Would you stop your lies . You are pathetic .
While that may be true , it fails to show that reproduction is a requirement in order to call something living : that living things would disappear as a result of their not reproducing doesnt show that they are not living before they disappear . [ start : added 01/01/2006 ] In fact , even with reproduction , organisms - such as leopards , elephants , whales , and so on - will eventually die out . Does that mean that they are not living organisms now ? Of course not . [ end : added 01/01/2006 ] The pro-reproductionists second attempt , and improvement on the first , might go something like this :
Then thats as far as we can go on it , and thats fine . Not being a science worshiper myself , I simply dont automatically take this type of blanket statement as automatically true . What largely prompted this thread happened last Tuesday - 6:30 AM , and a six-figure weather forecaster scientist guy assured everyone watching him that a pretty nice day was ahead , largely cloudy yet with peeks of sun , with a slim chance of very spotty rain . 2 hours later , the beginning of widespread heavy rain , for three solid hours . Unusual of course , but if we have scientific blunders concerning a few miles , I can imagine we could have a few blunders concerning hundreds of thousands of light years .

Way to miss the entire point , Clerisian . My point was that is it a horrible experience for many women , and that I wish we could strive towards a society where abortions were no longer needed . Wishful thinking by a midtwenties female who just went through the most horrifying experience of her life , forgive me if I did n't clarify well enough . I ca n't imagine that anyone would disagree with that .

So despite his long article Behe is still working on the same assumption I stated above : function is only a product of conscious design : there is no other valid explaination of the structure and function of life . Now , what I 'd like to hear you describe is exactly how intelligent design works in action : 1 ) How long does intelligent design take , x years or is it instantaneous ? 2 ) By what mechanism does the designer interact with the natural world ? 3 ) When and why does the designer choose to interact with the world ? 4 ) Why has the vast majority of intelligently designed life ceased to exist ? if it was designed correctly in the first place why was it necessary to discard so many forms and replace them with different ones , as evidenced by the fossil record ? 5 ) What experiments have been conducted to verify the occurence of intelligent design ? I 'm most interested to hear your ideas on these points .
What are you talking about ? How was I begging the question ?

This is a common creationist trick . Jonathan Wells has two PhD 's , one in Molecular and Cell Biology , the other in Religious Studies . Jonathan Wells works for , or affiliated with ( it 's difficult to know for sure ) The Discovery Institute . This is a pro `` Intelligent Design '' ( ie Biblical Creationism by stealth ) organisation based in Seattle in the USA . It spends around $ 1 million a year promoting `` Intelligent Design '' and attempting to rubbish evolution . I 'm not suggesting that Jonathan Wells is inherently wrong ; I 'm just pointing out that he is far from `` objective and neutral '' on this subject .

That is n't what it says at all , it says he took pains as in he made this point particularly clear . Whilst genes are reacting to changes in human behaviour ( which is n't news , there are loads of examples like this . One of the best ones would be how alcohol tolerance varies across the world between cultures who have used fermentation and those that traditionally boiled water ) he is making it clear that these behavioural changes are not genetic .
So if a gay couple plans to adopt , they can get married ? And if a straight couple gets married , and then find out they ca n't have kids , does their marriage gets changed to a civil union ? Or is it just desire to have kids ?

You have to be logical and realistic in your expectations of what can demonstrated/observed as evolution in action and what can only be described from evidence from the distant past . We can see the evolution of organisms in the world today , but because of the reproductive timeframe of many creatures we would not expect to see signifcant evolution take place in their populations over the last couple of hundred years . Take something that reproduces fast enough and great changes can be seen- look at the HIV virus and the myriad separate strains that have developed from a common ancestor in just a few decades of observation . Ancient life can never be observed in its living state- all we have are the remains of these creatures in the form of fossils . As we can position these remains in time using stratigraphy and radiometric dating we can see what their relative temporal positions were . By comparing similar forms we can see how a descendant differs from its ancestor so we can determine how the structure of that line changed with time . So we see what has changed and when but we can not see the exact `` how '' , in the ancient instance at least ( this is where the study of the modern gives insight ) .

Actually , your argument makes no sense . It 's not the pesticides used on the tobacco crop that makes it harmful , it 's the chemicals they add to the tobacco to make the smoke more palatable . Your whole point here is moot .
And how do we know that she would have wanted it . What if the Petersons got into a fight because Laci found out Scott had been cheating on her and that was the reason why he killed her ? What if they would otherwise have gotten a divorce and then she would have gotten an abortion because she no longer wanted the baby ?
People have entertained and will always continue to entertain beliefs in all manner of propositions . Many people once believed that the earth is flat : perhaps some still do . But this has nothing to do with scientific truth . There is no `` version '' of science that one chooses from a menu of possibilities . By definition , scientific enquiry arrives at hypotheses after gathering evidence from observations and experiment . Any law , knowledge , etc . that is arrived at by scientific method is open to modification or falsification if new evidence comes to light that must be taken into account . All science in this sense is provisional . The apostles may have believed that Jesus walked on water : that does NOT make it true .
I believe the large majority of such deaths occur among inner city kids who do n't know anything about guns except for what they see on TV and movies .
So , you would vote to legislate against it ? Ok , now that thats cleared up , why do you consider sex to be so bad ? Sex is a healthy part of a relationship or marrige , and i would not go to these lengths to minimize it . Sex has a small risk of ending in pregnancy , and an even smaller risk if using a condom , and even smaller than that if the woman uses a contraceptive . Then , if EVERYTHING fails , there would be abortion in the extreme circumstances that it does result in a pregnancy . I doubt that criminalized abortion will reduce sex . It will only cause suffering and fear for women . I thought we were out of the dark ages already .
So was I. I did say I was playing devil 's advocate . As far as I 'm concerned , Tiktaalik is a triumph of scientific deduction .

This is not my problem . As I explained above , I just have to show inconsistency in order to reject the validity of all the claims in the Bible as being undeniable truth . And with the Bible , that 's damn easy to do .
Oh , I am just so bothered and annoyed that I ca n't prove my faith ! ! ! Actually , I 'm not really that bothered nor annoyed . I know that all the evidence points to creation , i.e . the creation interpretation makes more sense than the evolutionary interpretation . There is very good evidence to suggest the existence of God , for one , the fact that we are all still here is one . If there were no God , than this whole universe would cease to function . I believe the laws of nature and our sciences are man 's attempt to describe the normal ways that God upholds His creation . When He acts differently , a miracle occurs . Of course , this is based on the belief that the Bible is true . Many other great scientists , including Newton and Galileo also seemed to believe that science and Christianity were compatible . Reason stems from the belief that the universe is orderly , rational and logical . By the dictionary , reason is the intellectual faculty by which conclusions are drawn from premises . Now , if we are accidents of pure chance ( which evolution teaches ) than the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance . If your logic is the result of chance processes , you ca n't even be sure it evolved properly . This is just to show that with evolution , you ca n't be sure of anything , because everything is just an accident . But with an orderly and rational Creator , you can be sure of things and be able to reason .

And you have a right to cling to superstition and magic as true . But that does n't make mythology true .
I think the christians you describe do not disregard creation in Genesis per sae . They would agree absolutely with your 2 fundemental truths at the start of your post . However , they do not see it as a history as such , but more as an analogy to what happened . Some take it simply to say that God created the universe and put a soul in humans and find the detail of that ( not the soul bit ) in what we have discovered through science . Others would say it becomes `` historical '' at a certain point- Adam and Eve or maybe Noah . I do n't think they are any less christian than those who choose to believe the story of creation literally , and it would surprise me to hear someone say that was the case . I think it does pose some awkward questions to hold such a view though , and while I do n't see all your 8 examples in your later post as being the ones I have heard , they are certainly of that nature . Christianity has struggled with the logical conclusions of observation of the physical world for much time . Some of the examples from history are amusing today- the Omphilodian Heresy where the very discussion of whether Adam and Eve had navels was a heinous religous crime . The Heliocentricity debate where the Catholic Church eventually relented their scripture based denial of the earth orbiting the sun . And today the debate over the old earth and evolution . This seems to arrive from the fact that the religon is so encompassing in its assertion of truth . While this helps to create a powerful system of belief , it can put it in an awkward position when new discovery is made . The nature of peolpe seems to be the same conflicts have arisen again and again- with just the point of contention changing .
quality of life ? yes it is reasonable to expect a quality of life ethic to take the backseat to a sanctity of life ethic . Health ? well , what is your definition of health ?

That 's nonsense . When Darwin was at the University of Edinburgh studying medicine , he spent more time studying zoology and geology . His teachers were some of the most respected scientists of the day . Later , when he was at Christ 's College , Cambridge studying divinity in preparation entry into the seminary , he actually spent more time studying botany and natural science , under John Henslow ( a mineralologist and botanist ) . Darwin later studied with Adam Sedgwick ( a geologist ) . Both men were leading scientists in their field of the day ( both taught at Cambridge ) . Henslow became a lifelong friend of Darwin and it was his recommendation that gained Darwin the position aboard the Beagle . By the way , both men were ordained in the Chruch of England .

I think that Believer may be referring to microbe to man evolution ( i.e . simple life to more complex life ) . Your definition is not entirely accurate and misleading . By this , massive ammounts of new information must be added to the genome of the microbe to get it to `` evolve '' to a human , about 999 books each consisting of 500 pages fine print of information must be added to change a microbe to a human . That 's a lot of information is n't it ? Now where does all that information come from ? It ca n't come from a Creator , there 's no Creator according to atheistic evolutionism . Evolutionists say that this new information comes from accidental changes in the DNA when the information is being copied , these acidents are called mutations . Is this true though ? Do mutations produce the new information required by microbe to man evolution ? Dr Lee Spetner , an Israeli biophysicist says that there is not one mutation that one can point to that on the molecular level can be seen to increase the information in the genome . They actually all turn out to reduce the information in the genome . Let 's take the example of the Totally Naked Rooster , the TNR mutant . What has the mutation done ? It has obviously destroyed the information for making feathers . Has the rooster ever been improved by the mutation ? From the point of view of the chook farmer , probably yes , because no feathers - no plucking required . But what about from the point of view of the rooster ? Well , he 's going to freeze in winter and fry in summer , not much of an improvement for the rooster . This mutation has destroyed the information for making feathers . It can also be shown that anti-biotic resistance is the result of an information losing mutation , and many other evidences of evolution in action are also the result of information losing mutations - which matches perfectly with the creationary model , i.e . varriation within a kind . See , evolution can cope with the occassional down-hill mutation , but they really need a lot and a lot of up-hill , information gaining mutations if they are going to change a reptile into a bird , for example , and change a microbe into a human over eons of years . The problem is , we just do n't see these information gaining mutations occuring at all today . Now natural selection is also supposed to be the hero of the plot to , right ? Well , actually , natural selection also results in a loss of information for a certain population . We 'll take the example of a population of dogs that are taken to a very cold environment with varrying fur ( or hair ) sizes . The population consists of the following fur sizes : LL - Long fur . Ll - Medium fur sizes . ll - Short fur sizes . where L = long fur gene , and l = short fur gene . Obviously , the cold will kill of those dogs that are not fit to handle the cold whether . The poor dogs with short fur sizes would be the first to go , then followed by the medium fur sized dogs - that makes sense does n't it ? Take them to a place like Antartica . Over short time , only the dogs with long fur sizes would survive . Our surviving population consists of the following fur sizes : LL - Long fur . We started off with a or variety of fur sizes in the population , but , as you can see , the short haired gene was eliminated from the environment by natural selection . Thus the population has lost information . So natural selection does not add information to the population , it erases information that disadvantages a population from living in a certain environment , such as the short haired gene ( l ) in this case . Hence , neither mutations nor natural selection adds any new information to the genome .

the reason why premise 1 can logically stand is that God is first of all defined as the `` greatest possible being '' . no matter what reality we are considering , such a thing as the greatest possible being in that relity must exist . `` greatest '' is a superlative , compared to all other beings that exist its like `` the oldest man alive '' . no matter what scenario , such a person as the oldest man alive will always exist , therefore such a man ( that fits that definition ) will have a necessary existence

The big bang theory actually describes the universe very well and is the best working model we have . No one has developed a complete model of the universe that can describe all observations . That does n't make the model completely false , it just makes it incomplete . Back in the day , Newtonian physics was dominant . Then came Einstein 's Theory of General Relativity ( which is fascinating in discovering that space and time are one thing ) , and the Big Bang Theory which developed on top of that . There are problems with General Relativity , which breaks down the closer the model gets to the actual moments of the beginning of the universe . I 'm going to say it again : the model is n't wrong , its incomplete . Models get replaced by better models that better fit our observations . Big Bang merely describes the way the universe works , it does n't make any predictions as to what was responsible for setting these events in motion .

Neutral ? One of the main standards and reference points for science and evolution on the internet is talkorigins.org . It 's promoted as an educational site - a place with answers to criticisms of the evolutionary theory . It 's every bit as biased as AnswersinGenesis , yet in many cases it 's difficult for ID proponents to target . Part of the broad definition of evolution is microevolution , about the only segment of the broad term that is provable . They can masterfully employ that to make an ID proponent appear uninformed or irrational if he questions happenstance orignis , or other unproven evolutionary assumptions . They make their atheism clear in many ways however . They devote a page to comment about the `` International Flat Earth Society '' , pretending they believe it to be a legitimate site . Almost any rational adult can see that it 's phony . ( Wikopedia calls it a hoax ) There 's nothing neutral , or even agnostic , about that site , and it appears to represent the anti-ID-in-schools mindset to a T. If there 's actually a more neutral , agnostic , scientific website that opposes ID being taught in schools , I 'd like to see it .
What early days are you talking about ? In ancient Greece , everything was about logic and order and was put into a polytheistic context . Then Aristotle came along and gave us `` emprical '' thought . When christianity rolled onto the scene , most `` science '' of those first 1700 years ( mostly things like astrology and alchemy ) were seen as witchcraft and such and was persecuted . Maybe you mean the early days of modern science , starting around the enlightenment period . This was the time of a rise in secular humanism and science was largely an extension of that philosophy . They used to just call it `` natural philosophy '' and it was usually at odds with church doctrine . There are , of course , exceptions to this , but on the whole science was not favored by the church . So any `` creation science '' going on was just a bunch of theologians arguing . ( actually I do remember reading about late 18th century geologists trying to fit what they found , including fossils , into a Biblical Noah 's Ark context , and then they eventually had to scrap it because things stopped fitting , and quite often ) http : //www.wsu.edu:8000/~dee/ENLIGHT/SCIREV.HTM I thought this was a pretty interesting page .

Correct . Form letters go in a junk pile . Individual letters are a different matter .

So , in your opinion , are you saying that this invading force that you are talking about , would never bat an eye as to whether the people of the USA are armed to the teeth or not in their pre-war planning ? Surely any country that tried to overtake the USA would suffer severe damage to its military in all aspects.And even if it succeeded , it would still have to deal with our armed citizens . Are you trying to tell me that this is not a ditterent ? Sure , if you dream up some DARTH VADER size invasion , no one stands a chance.But if you put it real world perspective.Say,2 or 3 of the bigger countries got together and decided to over take the USA.I would assume `` armed citizens '' would be a major factor in deciding whether to invade or not .
So what developed nations have lower murder rates than the US ?

Well said ! The two things that seem to motivate us most are fear and greed !
1 . From what I have learned , different locations breed different surroundings . Human ancestors were migratory pack animals . Where they went , they encountered new types of pressures , causing them to change over time . 2 . Different selective pressures . Different areas can lead to different pressures . Some mutations also occured etc . Things like that . Evolution does n't HAVE to occure non-stop if there is equilibrium . Not everyting is always changing , as far as I learned . Barring mutations that cause significant changes over a lot of time , Apes , Chimps , Monkies would n't really change all that much . There 's no real pressure to do so . They are already well-adapted to their surroundings . Actually however , there really is n't that much difference between some of the great apes and Humans . Take the Bonobo Chimps , for example . They have 98 % the same DNA as Humans . They are the closest to HOmo Sapien . 3 . Niches . Related to above . Crocs , for example , do n't evolve that much because they are a very successful animal design and they found a place in which they can thrive for generations with little to no changes . Other animals can do the same . 4 . As well , humans did n't come directly from Apes . We all evolved from a common ancestor who did all of the above . http : //www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/species.html Here is a time line of hominid species http : //www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-speciation.html http : //www.talkorigins.org/faqs/speciation.html Evolution does n't lead to a higher species , as well . There is no hierarchy in nature . Each species is equally as well `` evolved '' depending on it 's environment etc . A Human is no more evolved than a Chimp or better than a Chimp . Evolution does n't lead to progression , but merely change . It 's not getting better toward some high standard . Humans just like to think so .
So then the law is flawed because criminals could just as easily get their hands on select firearms , ban or no ban . You 've just admitted that the bill did nothing and thus there 's no justification for it to be reinstated .
Hmm . . . funny , I do n't remember ever hearing a pro-lifer say that pregnancy was a wonderful snuggly thing or the best thing in the world . What I do see is pro-lifers like myself wondering why pregnancy is protrayed ( in the form of a generalization ) as so horrible by people such as yourself who just described it as `` unbelievably '' hard to go through , or a `` life threatening condition '' like malignant cancer . You did n't qualify it by saying `` some '' pregnancies are life threatening or unbearable . Maybe yours was , but how can you say that for every woman in the world ? I know for a fact that my wife 's pregnancy was not `` unbelievably hard to go through '' -- she 's told me otherwise and I believe her . Sorry , but I believe my wife over you . What you did was use unfounded generalizations , which is exactly the sort of thing this thread is about .
Though it does n't really say why , the Bible says that is what will happen . See Matthew 7 :13,14 . It 's part of God 's plan . Free will .

Where is your evidence of `` no God '' Atheism is a curse ! Agnosticism , is the only intellectually honest position , and next , as we proved with Freud , even the so called atheists , show up late in life as Theists ! ! ! Psalm 8,9 , 14 , 18 , 19 .

We 're you just talking about oversimplification ? I see you conveniently leave out the in depth issues that contribute to how other nations work . Police powers , government oversight , economy , the rights of the people , etc . Why do you choose to believe that the gun laws are the sole determining factor that make all the difference ?
And by old fashion I assume you mean Greece a couple of thousand years ago . That 's the only place and time I can think of off hand where the populace ( by which I mean landed men in this case ) could vote to change laws . In this country the correct procedure for a citizen to change an unjust law is via the courts , and always has been . However , I do n't think that is , in fact , what Jyoshu was refering to .
Those are some very interesting points you brought up . It 'd be interesting to see an experiment that could answer your questions .
Actually , the word evolution never means atheism except when used by creationists who want to pretend that science is anti-christian .
Let 's take this slowly ... a ) Montalban is asked to give a definition of unknowables , and does so Mach : It 's illogical , merely defining it does n't prove it exists . b ) Mach is asked to show a scientific test for dark Mach : Look I do n't have a scientific test for dark , but I can prove it exists by giving a definition of it ! Once again you defy yourself ! So , merely defining 'darkness ' does not prove it exists BY SCIENCE . What you have done is to confirm that it ca n't be defined BY SCIENCE . SHOW ME THE SCIENCE THAT DEFINES DARKNESS . If you ca n't then we have evidence for a suggestion that something exists ( in nature ) that science ca n't test for .

There are precious few areas on the planet that have not been explored . Those that have n't would not support the kinds of life we are talking about . There is no evidence of any interim species of apes and humans . Not one shred . Those items in the fossil record that are claimed as possibles are only possibles , are dubious at best , and are extremely rare . A recent study also showed that most characteristics of supposed alternate species of hominids were well within the variation seen in current homo sapiens . The point I was making is that if they existed we would see them .
No , its the truth . You ignore women in the scenario and see and use them as a mere tool for the birth of a fetus .

Really ? Then present your evidence . Which of the Archaeopteryx fossils has been questioned ? What was the evidence upon which this was based ? What are the other possible explanations for these fossils ? Of course , you will present the source of your objections . Also the qualifications of those who presented the questions - were they mathematicians and astronomers or paleontologists and ornithologists ? And then please go on to discuss the fossils themselves . How many are there ? What are they ? Please discuss the presence or lack of the gastralia , furcula , carina , opposable hallux , fused trunk vertebrae , pneumatic bones , feathers , beak , teeth , tail ( of free vertebrae ) , fibula , clawed digits on forelimbs , preorbital fenestra , and so on . Please detail the `` status '' of these fossils , i.e. , how many opinions are there , who holds these positions , and on what evidence do they base the opinion ? If those who assert that the fossils of Archaeopteryx are questionable are correct , then what possible questioning of the `` status '' of the fossils can there be . Perhaps this will be a case where Calli has actually learned before speaking . If so , then perhaps we should start a separate thread to discuss Archaeopteryx . However , I suspect that Calli has already told us all she knows .

Well regulated as in the second amendment does not mean regulated by the government , it means well equiped and prepared .

Your definition of well regulated makes about as much sense as adding another day to the week .

You know what , you may be on to something with that Satan idea . Maybe he worked through Darwin to effectively divide believers over the issue of creation . I am going to ask you one more time , where is the proof for evolution ? Where are the milllions of fossilized links with slow and obvious changes supposedly caused by the `` evolving process '' ? It is useless to debate with you if you are n't going to give me any CONCLUSIVE evidence .
I think you can forget about God the super `` engineer '' on this one : your final question contains a necessary and sufficient condition to explain the case .

President Obama has correctly characterized the Bill of Rights is a list of negative Rights against government . The point is , that the only rights that the government , and or any anti-gunner , or department has , is the infringements we grant them through laws etc . Taking the info in this article at face value . What was a legal practice to do just yesterday landed this guy in a jackpot for not knowing what or how the Govt . is going to interpret the law to mean today . This is a common problem with , and not to directly pick on the ATF , but gun dealers complain about this all the time . EVEN an FBI agent himself can not predict , nor curry a favorable interpretation . What kind of country and legal system do we want ? Surely you can see that this kind of stuff is not in ANY WAY Shape of Form , fair to do to a Right that our Constitution says is Inalienable . Or to a person who was an impeccable reputation . Would you like to be treated in this manner ? The article says , what he did is not illegal , but in the hands of someone with an axe to grind , maybe they didnt like him , or maybe the prosecutor is Anti-gun etc , lands this guy in a jackpot ! Now can you see the problem with this ? I know lets apply all of this to computers ! We will just make up any law as we go . Howd that be ?

Jurassic Theropods like Compsognathus had hollow bones . http : //www.cbv.ns.ca/marigold/histor ... gnathuspic.jpg Therepodian dinosaurs show clear general skeletal affinities with modern birds such as long limbs , hollow bones , foot with 3 toes in front and 1 reversed toe behind and a long ilium . Coelophysis , from the late Triassic was one of the first theropod dinosaurs . Deinonychus and Oviraptor from the late Triassic to the Cretaceous were bipedal advanced theropods , larger , with more bird-like skeletal features : semilunate carpal , bony sternum , long arms and reversed pubis . Striking detailed similarity to birds . There is a gap in the fossil record here although Protoavis could belong here , unfourtunately , the fossil is poor . Archaeopteryx from 225 Ma , shows a mosaic of reptilian and avian features , with the reptilian features predominating . The skull and skeleton are basically reptilian ( skull , teeth , vertebrae , sternum , ribs , pelvis , tail , digits , claws , generally unfused bones ) . Bird traits are limited to an avian furcula ( wishbone , for attachment of flight muscles ; recall that at least some dinosaurs had this too ) , modified forelimbs , and -- the real kicker -- unmistakable lift-producing flight feathers . Archeopteryx could probably flap from tree to tree , but could n't take off from the ground , since it lacked a keeled breastbone for large flight muscles , and had a weak shoulder compared to modern birds . ( Wellnhofer , 1993 ) S. santensis from 138 Ma was a better flyer than Archaeopteryx . It had a short trunk , claws on the toes , flight-specialized shoulders , stronger flight- feather bones , tightly folding wrist and short hands . A not yet named bird/dino from 131 Ma has a reptilian pelvis and legs , with bird-like shoulders . The tail is medium-length with a fused tip . Then there 's Hesperornis , Ichthyornis , and other Cretaceous diving birds . There are many fossils . Their skeleton is further modified for flight showing fusion of pelvis bones , fusion of hand bones and a short , fused tail ) . It also still had true socketed teeth , a reptilian trait . There are others and this is by no mean exhaustive . This is just to show that there are very good transition lineages . Although no modern birds have teeth , chicken bills can be induced to develop teeth , indicating that chickens still retain the genes for making teeth . There is also an intriguing fossil Microraptor gui that has flight feathers on both the front and back legs . http : //eur.news1.yimg.com/eur.yimg.c ... 2567138235.jpg I can provide more info on any of these if you wish .

Why ? I have heard variations on this many times and it utterly baffles me . Why do you feel we need a divine being who is interested in us , personally and collectively , for us to have any 'hope ' ? Hope , for me , as in hope for humanity , comes from what I see around me as being the positive qualities that we have as a race . I can not believe that a universal consciousness would care ( in terms of what we humans think of as caring ) about what happens to us in the long run , because the long run is either heat death or big crunch . If we are still around in this unimaginably distant future we may well have developed means to avoid the same fate as the universe , but if we do n't , or if we die out before that , then that 's that . End of story . This is kind of tied in to the question I had trouble answering before , the answer to which I am still having problems defining : If God is the universe , he/she/it is also every one of us , every particle as I said before . If you look at the history of the planet in terms of particles , it 's all just one dynamic system , the rocks , the oceans , the atmosphere , and the biosphere as well . The plants and creatures on this planet are made of atoms that used to be part of the rocks , oceans , and atmosphere . From this singular perspective there is no distinction between the living and the non-living parts of the planet ; it 's one colossal biochemical reaction . I will concede that it is possible that this 'God ' entity might be aware of our own consciousness , because according to my own logic the entity also is the matter that constitutes our brains , and it is certainly the case that many people believe God has spoken to them . Some of these people are treated as having had religious experiences , some are treated as having lost their sanity . However this in no way leads me to contemplate the idea that the Bible , Koran , Hindu Vedas etc are any more revelatory truths than are the Greek Myths or the Aboriginal Dreamtime ; these are human constructs . Some of the individuals mentioned in these various texts may have had 'divine ' experiences ( or may have been insane { same difference } ) but it does not logically follow that any of these texts have any special significance , either compared with one another or even if accepted equally or on their own merit .
Actually , mutations accumulate in both populations .
So now we 're embracing the concept that the victims of brutal stabbings are less important than those who 've been shot to death ?

Look again , Smith . All those killed in these places , died in a location where they were told they could n't have a gun with them . More guns were n't a part of the equation , less guns were . There were no guns in these locations except for those illegally brought in by the killers , and those of the police who arrived after it was already too late . Fewer guns are n't the answer , anybody with a dab of common sense would realize that because it 's impossible to disarm the bad guys .
More proof to prove my point , thanks !
So you admit right from the beginning that creationism is not a scientific endeavor but one of religion . You also falsify your own dichotomy in the next sentence by limiting `` creationism '' to your particular brand of christianity and thus exclude various other myths that are as valid as the mythology of bronze age herdsmen . I do n't know what the rest of your sentence has to do with science so I suppose it is religious . It is therefore meaningless in a discussion of science .
If a woman likes pregnancy , that is her preference . If a woman hates pregnancy , that is also her preference . Simple as that .

Ditto . To unkerpaulie , you are good ! I really enjoyed reading your post , especially the last part : `` just means that there are cerain illogicalities that can never exist '' . I would also say that God is also a logical being from whom we derive our logic - which appears to be missing in the original post ... The original post does not put limits on God 's power , just , as unkerpaulie said , there are certain illogicalities that can never exist .
Archie , instead of deciding before hand that I 'm wrong , read what I 'm saying . What trees were growing during this flood ? I 'm guessing there were no acorns sprouting into oaks during the flood . Therefore , in this flood sediment , we would find no rooted trees . We would find no burrows , and we would find no tracks . Now we 've seen you ca n't answer my question . Whether this is because you did n't understand it , or did n't want to consider it , I do n't know . But there is no global flood sediment which meets the criteria neccessary to demonstrate a global flood .

Actually , no . That 's not what you said .
Yes . Because evolution requires an old earth , supersport has lumped geology into the evil conspiracy . As our best explanations for the formation of the earth appeal to cosmology , that field as well as astronomy fall within the realm of quack science , according to supersport . In fact , every scientific discipline that has any connection whatsoever to evolution must be corrupt ; obviously , chemistry is one of them ( we ca n't make glycogen or DNA without magical , `` atheistic '' polymerization , right ? ) .
Do n't expect Scalia to be too friendly to this case , and of course whatever Scalia does Thomas does . It would be sadly ironic if we progunrights people lost this case even with Kennedy 's vote .

That 's a bit of a sidestep . Abortion is not genocide because abortion is not destruction of a certain group of people based on race , religion , ethnicity , etc . There is no way to make a case for abortion being genocide without making capitol punishment qualify as genocide . Frankly , I think it 's easier to do the latter ( yet most pro-lifers are also pro-death penalty ) . If you want to make an argument , then make an argument . But do n't call abortion genocide ; that 's just dumb .

Ah . Johnathan Wells is an evangilcal YEC who got his education in Biology to `` disprove '' evolution . He rejects science at all levels . I would not take serioiusly anybody associated with the 'discovery institute ' . Mr Wells does have the advantage of having a better education that most of them , but his degree was gotten to promote Young Earth Creationism , and was paid for by Sun Yen Moon . I would say that the review is a bit high level , but accurate .
Oh good grief newbies are all the same on this forum ... Honestly , how many times do you think I 've heard the Exodus and Numbers quote on this forum given my post count and join date ? Do a search on the Exodus one ... easy to see that is wrong . The Numbers quote has nothing to do with who or who is n't valuable to God . That 's like saying counting people over the age of 40 years old means everyone below is not a person .
Actually Hank I agree with you . I do n't believe it happened either . I am curious to hear your opinion on the matter .
Yea I agree with you on how there was no exact se t of laws at the beginning of creation . The reason I say that they most likely did n't marry their sisters is mostly cause God gets mad at Cain and places a mark on his head so everyone he runs across will not kill him unless they want to die a death 10 times worse than his . Kinda just says that there are other people out there .
Wead my weply to wascally ... Species evolve because the sequence and organisation of genes evolves . It does n't take a vast amount of genetic change to evolve one species from another , but it does take genetic change , and molecular geneticists are currently mapping the sort of changes needed to alter rates and timing of gene expression.If you remove the genes from a cell that requires constant gene expression to function , it will cease to function . That 's so obvious it does n't need explicating . I do not see , hoever , how any of this can be used to make an anti-Darwinian case . Biologists already know there 's more to evolution than Darwinian natural selection , hells bells , even Darwin knew that ! There is nothing in theory to prevent autoregulatory gene networks that control their own expression evolving by natural selection . If there is , somehow every biologists seems to have missed it .
Actually , I believe it was a Reagan policy continued by both Bushes .
There is a lot of that . Many mutations are recessive and a population over time accumulates a lot of genetic variation that can become useful if the environment changes . The founder population of lizards , for example , could have had at most , 20 alleles for any gene locus , since each lizard can only have 2 . The new ones evolved by mutation . Sometimes , we can even observe that happening , or trace the mutation back to a known ancestor . Would you like to learn about it ?

In that case it would be not registering your guns which would lead to confiscation rather than registering your guns . The logic of your argument seems questionable . It would be like arguing- `` It 's the outright truth that property taxes lead to confiscation because if you do n't pay them the government can take your property . '' Would anybody seriously think that that is a good argument against property taxes ?

No . We do n't agree . For one thing your faith is n't a theory . Creation as described in Genesis is a myth , in fact , two myths . Furthermore , a scientific theory does n't mean `` wild guess with no foundation '' . That seems to be what you want the word to mean . In science a theory is an explanation for observed facts that has been tested . You see , a theory is predictive . I 'll give you some examples of scientific theories . The germ theory of disease , the theory of gravitation , the heliocentric theory , tectonic theory , atomic theory . Moreover , you are wrong that science can not observe actual evolution of life . It is done all the time . While it may be debatable that a virus is alive , the recent case of SARS making the jump from civets to humans after a mutation is evolution .
With what ? The Theropod dinosaurs were the size of a large bird , were excelent runners and probably ate insects . The first birds , as far as we can tell from the fossil evidence , were gliders so probably spent time in the trees . Small , agile , gliding dinosaurs could exploit an previously unoccupied niche .
yes , but if we can not even observe the effects of such a deity , what difference does it make to man whether such a God exists or not ? for now , i think we can comfortably conclude that this deity , if he exists , doesnt want to have his existence known . furthermore , this deity doesnt seem interested in interacting with mankind in any physical sense . what good is such a God ? whether he exists or not holds absolutely no bearing on reality .

well if you think the sun goes around the earth then its time for apocalypse .
SO an inalienable right put forth by our founding fathers is thus not true ? Is the concept of life within only the context of birth ?

Oh really ? Gun ownership allowed these `` lunatics '' as you call them , to become government dictators ? If I owned 50 guns and 10,000 rounds of ammunition , you 're saying I could run the government with an iron fist all by myself , just like that ? Any random person can just appoint themselves God over the entire nation , without a single ounce of resistance just because they 're armed ?
No problem . Pick your creation `` scientist '' and I 'll show you how they are a liar .
This brings up an interesting point , and that is that science is extremely limited . Using your logic , persons should not have believed in the fact that the earth is a round object floating in space before it was proven scientifically , even though it was a fact then , as it is now . This fact was written about in scripture long before science `` proved '' it , just as the description of the hydrological system was described in scripture long before scientists figured it out . THIS is where the evidence can be found for the validity of the Bible . When you find scripture after scripture of historical fact and scientific reference that is found to be accurate , you should tend to take is seriously . The problem with science is its arrogance . It 's inability to see that truth can be found in other areas is a real handicap . Add to that theories like evolution that disguise themselves as science , and you have a real problem . One does not stand on a train track with a train barreling down on them to `` prove '' they will die . This `` fact '' is usually taken to be reliable , even though that person has n't `` proven '' it to be true through experimentation . If you need scientific proof for everything you believe , you have a real problem . If this were the case , no legal decision on guilt or innocence could be rendered in a court room , since the decision is usually rendered based on the preponderance of the evidence related to a crime that was commited in the past . We have the same problem with the origin of life and evolution of species - macro changes that supposedly occured in the past . As such , every availble form of investigation should be followed up on . This includes metaphysical possibilities . They can be investigated just as evolution is , buy the study of history , manuscripts , archeological methods and statistical and prophetic evidences . Both scientists and creationists are talking about investigation to find truth , and to self limit your investigative techniques is not only reckless , but might be a form of self delusion . Requiring truth to conform to your standards , as scientists of the past did , can either cause great delay in finding truth , or cause you to miss it entirely .
But which can not be repeated nor observed - thus making a belief system about the past .
And you 're accusing him of not debating properly ? That 's the best you can do ?
Nope , it just shows people are getting sick of having the anti-abortion movement invading their public life . Back in 2001 , a pro-life group went as far to pay a pilot to tug a banner that held the picture of an abortion fetus while he flew over Southern California beaches . http : //www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/701445/posts Ever since 2001 , the pro-life movement has adopted some odd and extremely unpopular methods of protest .
He was probably an XXXXX to begin with then .
Of course it should n't be used as birth control , but because of religious ignorance against birth control , in any form , so many do n't have easy access , or even proper education about such things . Places which have proper access and education have far fewer unwanted pregancies as well . The USA has twice as many unwanted pregancies as Canada and I think 36 times as many as Japan . BTW , an interesting fact is that the USA ( 280 million } is now the 3rd most populous nation in the world right after China ( 1.3 billion ) , and India ( 1 billion ) . The former USSR had been 3rd , I think , with a little over 300 million .
Since I was there , I 'll give you an objective rundown : 1 . ) Dawkins did n't `` crash '' anything . He watched the movie without saying a word and participated in a Q & amp ; A session with the producer at the end -- a session that the producer deliberately started . 2 . ) There was no `` sneaking '' on any level . PZ , his daughter , and I all registered our names over the internet for the event and selected the option to have up to three guests come with us . We registered our real names , our real addresses , our real telephone numbers , and our real emails , and we all received confirmation emails approving our registration . 3 . ) What possible reason did they have to deny PZ a viewing of the film ? Dawkins and I pressed the producer Mathis on this issue , and he said it was about money -- he wanted PZ to come back in a month and pay his $ 10 . But this makes no sense . PZ was paid $ 1,200 for his interview . They thanked him for the interview in the credits . If money was a concern , they could have paid him $ 1,190 and given him a free reservation . Just the fact that he was in the film should have been enough to warrant a seat at a pre-screening event . This all begs the question : What in God 's name are they so bloody afraid of ?
You draw very interesting conclusions my friend . If this is your standpoint then what is the purpose of a government ?
That 's not evolution . Life has evolved in the lab , many times .
And this would be true . If he is allowed to have the belief that it is wrong or a sin then others are also free to have the belief that he is an progressive or enlightened
Just imagine Noah 's checklist ! There .
Oh , well . Apparently you want to talk molecular chemistry whereas I was hoping to discuss organismic evolution . Too bad . Good luck with anyone who wants to debate your topic , but it just does n't interest me .
Sucide ? Is n't that a mental health issue ? If you take a gun from a sucidal and depressed person , does that cure depression ? If it does that you have addressed the root cause of sucide . If it does not than you really have not done anything to cure the fundamental cause of sucide .
Well , you frame the question as a quote from me ... I did n't pose it like that so I do n't quite know how to respond short of saying the law of thermodynamics applies to human behavior int he sense that there is cause and effect . Because this was allowed it has effected society the way it is ...
Really ? I have argued that God is an epic liar ? Can you point out me arguing that at all you EPIC LIAR ? Once again you are interpreting what I have said through that sick and unbalanced mind of yours , and then extrapolating that I am now arguing in favor of calling my God an EPIC LIAR . Is it absolutely impossible for you to debate issues while actually responding to what we really say rather than reading into what we say and redefining it to fit your warped and perverse perspective ? I mean , how sick and disturbed must your powers of reason and logic be for you to interpret my argument that Man , because of our linear view of time , is misreading the fact that God placed the stars in space at the same time much more recently than it appears to us to have occurred , that God is then an epic liar ? Is God responsible for how we interpret the evidence when we attempt to do it apart from placing Him first and foremost into the equation ? Is He the liar ? Or are you who think like that deceiving yourselves by ignoring His place in the creation of time and space ? It is just completely beyond you to think from an honest and objective perspective , is n't it obvious child ! But for a more practical answer , imagine this . In the beginning , space was a void which spanned all of eternity . Only one object/energy source encompassed all of it from one end of its massive emptiness to the other , and that person was my God Yahweh . And in one second or minutes time , he spoke all of the stars that have ever existed , at different intensities and strengths , which causes them to burn out at different times . But he placed them at the very inner and outer limits of time and space at that time . Liken it to a farmer with a hand full of seeds . He pulls back his arm and throws those seeds to the end of the plot of land he is sowing at that time . To the ants on the ground , if they measured the time it would take to reach the farthest seed , it would represent a great distance , but to the farmer it was just one arms throw in time to disperse hundreds of seeds at one time . Now here we are as finite creatures who can only see time from our linear perspective . Time is plastic . Our linear measure is man made for our convenience only . That you place what we call the measure of so called light years is arbitrary at best . But I am getting too deep for you and this discussion . The point is that our God has the ability to place the stars in every corner of not only what we again , arbitrarily call our universe , but throughout all of time and space . But to we puny finite humans who have invented telescopes , it appears that these stars we are seeing today are ancient based on the perceived yet arbitrarily arrived at distance you believe they are from us . But since you are unable to even grasp the hugeness of our God , you also fail to appreciate that light years are a measure of distance rather than time . So by that definition alone , it is foolish to equate it with Earth time rather than Gods ability to reach any distant place in time and space and place stars there .
That ad is a flat out distortion of Palin 's view . Her view is that the state governments should decide how to regulate abortions . The consequence of that view is that the state governments would be free to allow abortion , or prohibit abortion , on whatever basis and to whatever degree they wanted .
A facinating way of framing it I should say . I could simply reply that pregnancy is preventable , that it is not a permanent condition and if one is patient it will end with the child 's birth . I could also point out that the fetus is not responsible for the pregnancy in that it did not decide on it 's own to come into existence and plant itself in the mother 's womb but rather it was the mother and father that made the child through their actions so why is it made to pay the ultimate price ?
Misunderstanding or misrepresentation ? Biologists and geneticists do not claim that DNA is isolated from the environment . We are well aware that the environment can cause mutations under many conditions ( cosmic radiation , x-ray , etc . ) . What is denied is that mutations are environmentally directed - in other words , exposure to cosmic radiation will not cause a mutation that will make the organism resistant to cosmic radiation . The mutations will be random . On the other hand , natural selection IS , by definition , the response of populations to their environment . The environment has been shown to have effects on DNA , i.e. , the genome of the population .
Oh I agree , but at the same time , and much more important , are those churches adhering to the whole counsel of G-d ? ? Because if they are , then the `` mega church '' has the greater responsibility to the community . If they are n't then you have accurately described what Jesus rebukes .
See above , please cite .
So you would rather that a grown woman , a mother even , died in pain rather than an 8 week old foetus which can not feel pain ?
Theres a book my mom has called `` The trouble with Islam '' by some lady . I do n't know her name , but it looks like it may bee a good book for you .
A good question , and its a good thing Im not a politician ( or even a talk radio host ) or then I would have to do some dancing . I remember once when President George Bush referred to Islam as one of the worlds great religions  I guess a U.S. President would have to do that , as the President of a country with no establishment of religion in its foundation . A Christian without speech police can refer to Islam in a more direct way  its a false religion . Just about any follower of one certain religion is going to have disdain for any other religion , as well as atheism . Many atheists may think they have an advantage in that regard  they think they can group all religions together as being wrong in similar ways about their faith , and separate themselves from them . But since the term religion is so broad and vague , its easy to see that atheists cant really do that so well , because there are a few religions that they cant have much disagreement with  Pantheism , scientism , would certainly be two , and there are probably more . Any religion that worships nature , with no defined god , is n't really at odds with atheism , is it ? Your phrase within parenthesis , without the influence of God , points out ( to me ) that discussions about God on these forums , and even throughout Christian study and discussion , are all too often about only his presence or absence , nothing more . There is something more , and that something is Satan , the great deceiver , the evil one . In Databeds hypothetical , where he said stuck them on a planet with no access to any knowledge of God or Christ , my belief is that God/Christ would be there , ( omnipresent ) but I wasnt really consciously thinking about the possibility of the evil one NOT being there . I believe its Satans presence that causes atheism and it also causes false religions to be dreamed up . So to clarify my answer to his question , for people on another planet with no access to any knowledge of God or Christ would become a blend of atheism and false religion , since Satan is the author of both . To me as a fundamental Christian , there is little difference between the two .
And , I 'm sure you ask yourself that very question before you unzip your fly and whip out your pecker , right ?
So you would go with the unknowable argument ? Well then this is applicable to your response : So now you have said that god is undefinable or often said `` supernatural '' . T : I believe in God A : What is God ? T : I dont know . Then my question to you would be that if you dont know what God is ... then what is it that you believe in ?
And if they do ? Is that as big a crime as an ID advocate making his case in a science classroom ? The fact is , the influence of evangelical atheists cant be kept out of the science classroom , because no consensus exists on just where the fact/philosophical line is drawn . If a teacher or a textbook cross the line in the slightest way , time consuming distracting religious/non religious discussions can follow .
And what does it matter if they 're in the army reserve , or a lawyer , a teacher , a doctor ?

You know how those anti-gunners are ? they just kinda get stuck in that same old revolving door.Ca n't come up with anything new so they rehash .
Cite your source , preferably online , so that it can be found easily . Of course , this is like you asking for an example of tests done on animals ( I assume that you mean vertebrates ) . Mutations can be harmful and often are , except when a selective pressure is exerted . In those cases , some mutations become helpful , and those reproduce . Please research your claims .
In some cases yes , in others no . If the mutation gives a huge advantage , then there will be a decline in the size of the gene pool for a while ( eg when the Australian rabbit population was reduced form 500 million to 100 million by myxomatosis , the gene pool strunk as a result and the genetic `` mutation '' that gave increased resistance spread throughout the whole population as a result ) . Most of the time though single mutations do not have such a huge advantage and so genetic variation is maintained .
So you would have the mother , all four fetus 's die instead . Well , just so long as your conscience is clear .
So you refuse to engage in an informal debate on the topic , but you all of a sudden are itchin ' for a formal debate ? How about you make the challenge ?
Your statment is like saying we evented 2+2= 4 . We did not envent it , it aways existed . Same with logic , its a concept that exists apart from the meterial universe . But in the atheists worldview , only the meterial universe exists .
Tell me who directed it .
Exactly , you have contradicted yourself and shown that the `` sanctity '' of life is a necessary foundation for the `` quality of life ''
It was in the news for a while and I 'm pretty sure the inquiry found that it was a terrible misfortune based on miscommunication between the hospital and the parents . There was no selling of stolen dead babies for profit type of business going on with is what Fishx implies with the first post . Sorry , did n't mean to offend there but I still think its better than another baby has a chance to live than pretty much anything with respect to the desceased . If it happened to me I would have no problem at all about any of my organs being used to save lives , either directly or indirectly through training of more doctors or research . Yet , I still respect your wishes and said before that if this is going to happen it should certainly be cleared with the parents first . You 're just going to have to accept my appologies and realise that I have no idea what you went through , having not been there myself . Being in an abortion forum , and the nature of the first post it seemed very quite possible that Fishx had had an abortion , though regretted it and wanted the remains to bury - this is a very different case than the one you have unfortunately experienced , hence the question .
In your first post . If you are to qualify that by stating I assert that reproduction is not an absolute requirement of life over the ontogeny of an individual then of course reproduction is not essential character of life .
Not heard that before ! made me laugh almost as much as your lettuce eating Tyrannosaur
Let me explain this to you . You want to stop abortions for someone else . You want to take a womans right to choose away . Where as Jito supporting a womans right to choose does not impose upon your life in any way . You want to stop me from being able to marry this does not effect your life in any way yet has a devastationg effect on my life . The left supports rights while your side want to limit the rights of others . You want to stop me from being able to marry because you have a religious belief against it even though I may have a religious belief that supports it . Therefore you are imposing your religious and moral views on me when I do not share those beliefs .
This why we think you 're a liar . http : //www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dino ... teocalcin.html
What are the reasons which you would present behind the statement `` all human life is sacred '' ( or whichever similar statement you think is the core of your pro-life stance ) ? If morality is based only on arbitrary proclamations , then there is little chance of consensus because other groups or religions come up with other arbitrary set of rules and we are back to the situation of , in the worst case , chaos and , in the best case , a majority imposing arbitrary rules on an unwilling suffering minority . I suspect that a lot of people , if not most people , at least partially follow some version of `` treat others as you would have yourself be treated '' . When , as children , we were scolded `` How would you like it if ... '' that is a tactic of teaching this rule . For those who are religious ( which I only marginally , occasionally and hesitatingly am ) , even Jesus stated `` Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you . '' in the Sermon on the Mount talk ( as quoted by ShadowPikachu ) . Many world religions and philosophies seem to incorporate that general rule , which is partly why I think it has a reasonable chance at being incorporated as a global base of morality .
Be wary of names . 'junk ' DNA is not rubbish ... it 's called 'junk ' because we do n't know entirely what it is used for ... But just look at all the blank spaces on this post . They are nothing , but they are keeping the words in order . Evolutionaries are putting too much faith in names of words - such as human embryonic 'gill slits ' or 'transitional ' fossil
I think that we 've got to draw a line at some point , to demarcate between adult and child . Where ever we do draw it , it will seem , in some situations to be arbitrary . If we made it 20 , the question would be why 20 year olds and not 19 . Through the years society has determined that by 18 people should have attained enough life experience to form intent and to comprehend that their actions have consequences ( at least as it applies to the death penalty , they can be tried as adults w/o death ) . We do n't execute people who ca n't comprehend the nature of their crimes and society says that , under 18 you ca n't fully comprehend criminal actions .
Well , if Genesis was in fact true , then we would have to assume that God is real and the Bible more or less explains what he wants , right ? And if there is someone `` up there '' who will damn you to eternal torment if you do n't do what he wants ( which is one interpretation of the Bible ) than that might effect the way you act . I realize that that is n't exactly the same as changing your moral compass , but history has demonstrated that most people 's moral will stretch to accomodate pressing needs , and I think an actual vengeful diety would qualify .
Well , to keep it short , Ill cite you to what I think are two of the best expressions of why the RKBA exists . The first was said by an Englishman named Andrew Fletcher , whose work was frequently cited by our founders to justify armed resistance against British misrule in America . The second was said by a Judge in my beloved Commonwealth of Virginia : And I can not see , why arms should be denied to any man who is not a slave , since they are the only true badges of liberty . . . .The possession of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave . He who has nothing , and belongs to another , must be defended by him , and needs no arms : but he who thinks he is his own master , and has anything he may call his own , ought to have arms to defend himself and what he possesses , or else he lives precariously and at discretion . And though for a while those who have the sword in their power abstain from doing him injury ; yet , by degrees , he will be awed into submission to every arbitrary command . Andrew Fletcher , Political Works , pp . 35 and 221 ( 1749 ) . The right of self-defense is the first law of nature ; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits ... and [ when ] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is , under any color or pretext whatsoever , prohibited , liberty , if not already annihilated , is on the brink of destruction . Sir George Tucker , Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia , in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES , Sir George Tucker Ed. , 1803 , pg . 300 There are many solid legal , moral , and practical arguments in support of private firearm ownership . Some are short , but many are long . I know quite a few of them , and Ill happily share them with you if you want some more ammo for your debate . Just let me know here . -- - False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience ; that would take fire from men because it burns , and water because one may drown in it ; that has no remedy for evils , except destruction . The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature . They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes . Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity , the most important of the code , will respect the less important and arbitrary ones , which can be violated with ease and impunity , and which , if strictly obeyed , would put and end to personal liberty -- so dear to men , so dear to the enlightened legislator -- and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer ? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants ; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides , for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man . They ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes , produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts , and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree . Thomas Jefferson , Commonplace Book , 1774-1776 , quoting 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment , 1764 A militia , when properly formed , are in fact the people themselves , and render regular troops in a great measure unnecessary . . . .the constitution ought to secure a genuine and guard against a select militia . . .and include . . .all men capable of bearing arms . . . . But , say gentlemen , the general militia are for the most part employed at home in their private concerns , can not well be called out , or be depended upon ; that we must have a select militia . . . . [ of the select militia ] These Corps , not much unlike regular troops , well ever produce an inattention to the general militia . . .whereas , to preserve liberty , it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms , and be taught alike , especially when young , how to use them . . . .The mind that aims at a select militia , must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle ; and when we see many men disposed to practice upon it , whenever they can prevail , no wonder true republicans are for carefully guarding against it . Richard Henry Lee , Additional Letters from the Federal Farmer , p. 169-170 ( 1788 ) Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India , history will look upon the Act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest . If we want the Arms Act to be repealed , if we want to learn the use of arms , here is a golden opportunity . If the middle class render voluntary help to Government in the hour of its trial , distrust will disappear , and the ban on possessing arms will be withdrawn . Ghandi , 2 M. Gandhi , An Autobiography of the Story of My Experiments with the Truth , p. 374 ( M. Desai , trans . 1927 ) . Whenever , therefore , the profession of arms becomes a distinct order in the state . . .the end of the social compact is defeated . . . .No free government was ever founded , or ever preserved its liberty , without uniting the characters of the citizen and soldier in those destined for defense of the state . . . .Such a well regulated militia , composed of freeholders , citizens and husbandman , who take up arms to preserve their property , as individuals , and their rights as freemen . M. T. Cicero ( a pseudonym taken by a writer arguing during the constitutional debates ) , Charleston State Gazette , September 8 , 1788 It has been asserted by the most respectable writers upon government , that a well-regulated militia , composed of the yeomanry of the country , have ever been considered as the bulwark of a free people . Tyrants have never placed any confidence on a militia composed of freemen . John DeWitt , The Anti-Federalist Papers , p. 75 ( M. Borden ed . 1965 ) Make mass searches and hold executions for found arms . V. I. Lenin , Collected Works , Vol . 35 , 4th ed. , p. 286 . From Congressional Record , April 28 , 1970 , p. H3601 . If the opposition disarms , well and good . If it refuses to disarm , we shall disarm it ourselves . Joseph Stalin , Reply to the discussion on the Political Reports of the Central Committee , Dec. 7 , 1927 . Stalin , Works , Vol . 10 , p. 378 . From Congressional Record , April 28 , 1970 , p. H3601.. The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms . History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing . Indeed , I would go so far as to say that the supply of arms to the underdogs is a sine qua non for the overthrow of any sovereignty . So let 's not have any native militia or native police . German troops alone will bear the sole responsibility for the maintenance of law and order throughout the occupied Russian territories , and a system of military strong-points must be evolved to cover the entire occupied country . Adolf Hitler , dinner talk on April 11 , 1942 , quoted in Hitler 's Table Talk 1941-44 : His Private Conversations , Second Edition ( 1973 ) , Pg . 425-426 .
Does n't that explain why manslaughter is like miscarriage , rather than why it is different ? And Clerisian , you did n't seem to be arguing that the two were distinct , rather you appeared to say that pro-lifers did support charging mothers who miscarried with manslaughter ( where the mother 's actions , say , drinking heavily , were the cause of death ) .
Agreed !
So your idea is completely unscientific .
He only understands natural selection when he belives that it goes against what is accepted by scientists .
The Muslim invasion . You guys need targets right ?
`` refuted ? '' O'rly ? First they start off defining evolution as `` moleclues to man '' despite what evolution actually states . That further proves my point about strawman . They do n't discuss what evolution actually is . Furthermore , the whole notion that increasing capacity and adaption is not increasing complexity is insane . If I take a simple structure , modify it to form something more complex , is that not a change in complexity ? The whole idea that modifying DNA , changing it , removing and adding is n't actually changing anything is retarded . And they are separating macro from micro . That 's an invalid argument given that macro is nothing more then the aggregate of micro . A billion tiny changes makes a few large ones . The second idiotic article cites Natural genetic engineering . Despite there being absolutely no evidence of this occuring anywhere .
And that 's your idea of disproff ? Pitiful .
What a condescending attitude you have . In case you have n't noticed , you are a very small part of the human race that you smuggly hold in contempt . ( Thankfully small ! ) Your mission should be to improve it , not to stand back and claim you are better than everybody else , as you seem to do . Killing innocent people of any age is wrong . Children are no exception , they are just the epitomy of innocence . The `` pretty sick '' applies to your own deluded thoughts . Rest assured , I will not mourn your death or the deaths of any of those you may have taught your insane values . You are !
It is 'change over time ' , not 'gradual change over time ' . The morphological changes tend to happen with a change in the environment . The difference between 'micro ' evolution and 'macro ' evolution is the number of steps . `` Macro '' evolution is a bunch of 'micro ' evoltultions that add up . You have two populations that you can compare that used to interbreed , and for some reason , do not , and then you add on a few 1000 'mircro-evolution ' events to each , they become very very different .
The idea of abortion as population control is absurd , especially forced abortions as someone mentioned a few posts ago . Anyone who has read a biology book knows the world has methods of population control on its own , we do n't need to be doing stuff like that ourselves .
Well I guess Nato basically : summed it up : Stupid is as stupid doe 's .
You need to read what people say more thoroughly , and think about it before you respond . When he said `` can '' ( and there are not many simpler words than that ! ) It did n't mean `` will '' , `` must '' , or `` shall '' be more aggressive . It has been shown that in some cases it `` CAN '' happen . It may not have happened with you . It still might , we do n't know . We might even say that it is not likely to happen , but we ca n't say that it wo n't , because sometimes some people do behave more aggressively when they have a gun .
Yes it is , police are n't obligated by the US Constitution to protect individual citizens . If they were , lawsuits could be filed every time a crime is committed , and the police would go bankrupt really quick .
BWAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH ! [ /quote ] So you are saying that my DNA reflects the fact that I live in Texas ?
Crammed with them , sure , why not ? Its easy , only a few million light years . The scientific method is used in weather forecasting too .
Semantics . God has mandated against homosexuality . My point is , people are prepared to admit that the creation story , and the story of noahs arc are metaphors . They read them , and then look at the evidence to hand and say `` Well , it ca n't be really true the way it is written , so it must mean this ... '' But the bias of the church against homosexuality is based of a small passage of text which , it seems , can not be interpreted away . That part that condemns homosexuality is accurate , straight-from-gods-mouth truth . Again , why the dichotomy ? Why are some parts of the bible open to interpretation , but others are rigid ?
Well said . It is a disgrace that the `` Flat Earth '' side of the argument never gets a look in geography lessons and that the `` Spontaneous Creation '' side of the argument never gets a look in when teaching kids about the life cycle of insects . Do you realise that they refuse to present the `` Cheese '' side of the argument when teaching about the moon these days ? It 's outrageous , how can our kids get a balanced education if such bias is allowed to continue !
Well that explains your anger . I hope you are blessed with homeliness . Makes your commitment easier to keep . How old are you now ?
So , are you saying that all anti-gunners are fearless ? ? ? If so , ,I must laugh .
Oh boy , you said it ! Is the Earth 's Magnetic Field Young ?
1 . ) Refusing to comment on scientific procedure means absolutely nothing . Maybe we do n't have anything to say . 2 . ) Testing your beliefs of your own scientific conclusions is not wrong . 3 . ) I do n't lie dude . 4 . ) Because we do n't give the response you would like is not wrong . 5 . ) Do n't think so . 6 . ) The only thing classical ad-naeseum is your own preconceived idea 's of creationism and creationist . You do n't want to debate the issues like normal civil people , you just want try to make fools of creationists . Usually you 're the one who start 's the insulting . Your hatred is obivious and you 're open to nothing . Just good 'ol boys patting each other on the back . I know this probably does n't apply to everyone , there are some good guys out there .
And here our Government says : Rights and Responsibilities
The criminals in DC already have their guns . All striking down DC 's handgun ban will do is let the law abiding be able to better defend themselves and be armed for a change .
Well , I have heard people on the pro-gun side say that most defensive gun uses do n't involve firing even one round . So limiting the capacity would probably have less of an effect on the ability to defend yourself than on crime . So why are people from the gun lobby always whining about restrictions like this ? When semi-automatic rifles were banned in Australia , hunters welcomed the law . They saw it as a challenge because it takes greater skill to shoot an animal with a bolt action rifle . Not so in America where some gun owners like to use guns that could take down planes to shoot small animals .
So what ? It 's not like institutions in this country have n't been changed before , including the supposed intitution of marriage ! Guess what ? It 's called progress , get used to it .
It is in the first place unclear to whom the `` further harm '' is done . But even granting that the fetus dies , it is not clear how the situation is analogous to abortion , because the intentions of not only the man but even more importantly of the pregnant woman are completely different .
Really ? The first description is of a Hippo ? Here 's a picture of a Hippo charlie : http : //www.dkimages.com/discover/pre ... 0/90065521.JPG Now tell me how this fits the description of the behemoths tail ? I quote : Job 40:15-24 ( New International Version ) 15 `` Look at the behemoth , [ a ] which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox . 16 What strength he has in his loins , what power in the muscles of his belly ! [ b ] 17 His tail sways like a cedar ; the sinews of his thighs are close-knit . 18 His bones are tubes of bronze , his limbs like rods of iron . ( In Hebrew , this literally reads , he lets hang his tail like a cedar. ) A Cedar is not a tiny insignificant tree as the hippos tail is when compared to other tails on other animals . You insult the intelligence of the ancients to imply that they could n't either name or describe a hippo by name which as you yourself admit , was a common animal in that part of the world . As for Leviathan being a crocodile or an alligator , again , are you telling me that their hides are invulnerable to arrows or spears and can not be punctured at all ? Would those animals stand firm and not flee from men who stood up to them with spears , javelins and arrows ? Not on your life . Though the sword reaches him , it can not avail ; nor does spear , dart , or javelin . He regards iron as straw , and bronze as rotten wood . The arrow can not make him flee ; slingstones become like stubble to him . Darts are regarded as straw ; he laughs at the threat of javelins. On earth there is nothing like him , which is made without fear. Leviathan played in the great and wide sea ( a paraphrase of Psalm 104 verses 25 and 26get the exact sense by reading them yourself ) .And do you think that the writer who describes this creature is just throwing in the part about smoke , light and fire coming coming forth from its mouth for creative license ? Job 41:18-21 18 By his exhaling a light does shine , and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning . 19 Out of his mouth go burning lamps , and sparks of fire leap out . 20 Out of his nostrils goes smoke , as out of a seething pot or caldron . 21 His breath kindles coals , and a flame goes out of his mouth.I fully admit that I am incapable of either explaining or proving what this animal was , but I know it is n't any known animal which currently exists . And Isaiah might have given us the answer as to why this animal no longer exists since we know it was invulnerable to human attacks in the ancient world.Isa 27:1 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent , even leviathan that crooked serpent ; and he shall slay the dragon that [ is ] in the sea .
Yep that is the problem . You cant tell .
Right . Please , reread your argument . Not to mention what Woodward actually said about Piltdown man . www.talkorigins.org
Again ? What do you mean ? I am talking about different sciences per se . What is your question ?
And so have animals . Plants have been wiped out in the great extinctions too . [ quote ] Carbon dioxide producing animals could even feed themselves with their own breathe ! [ /quot ] Huh ? You produce carbon dioxide . How do you propose to feed yourself with that ?
You just say this because you want to murder helpless wromb-trapped human beings . You can not just say you personally believe something in a debate .
Why , is there something wrong with being pro abortion ?
You have n't proven anything . All you have done is spew your same old drivel which ignores what I actually say and reinterprets it to mean what you want it to say . You must corrupt what I say since you ca n't accept the truth of my beliefs and win your fallacious argument .
I believe this is wrong . But this is a private company , and if they want to discriminate based on religion , that 's fine , just as a church may outlaw atheists . Do I agree with it ? No . But does it have to do with our debate ? No . This is about the science classroom . Also , again abiogenesis is a hypothesis , the same level as ID .
And that 's all irrelevent , because pages 240-243 concern what happens in the world today , not what happened concerning creation . His feelings about God 's interactions with the world today would be different if he had a basic knowledge of the Bible .
Notice that nowhere here do you address the claims and evidence -- which the movie apparently lacks -- about the assertions of `` the expelled . '' Trying to deflect attention from your inability to respond substantively wo n't fly with us ; these guys are fudging the stories and sharing only selected pieces in a specific attempt to hide what really happened . For what it 's worth , I feel a hell of a lot more vulnerable as an atheist in my profession and location than IDers should feel in research and teaching academia .
Since you redacted my previous statement , I repeat it for your benefit : There is nothing racist about the truth . Notice the underlying message in your posted article is about the Court of Appeals throwing her LAWSUIT out . That was the underlying agenda which motivated this racist jerk who also happens to be black . It is common of these people today to refuse to obey the law , then blame the cops for not allowing them to act like they do . Remember that it was she who was speeding in a school zone , then to refuse to give up her keys made her a public safety threat . She deserved what she got even though the thought of a pregnant woman being tasered is scary to me , she could have avoided it by cooperating with the police . I 'm not pregnant and I would cooperate to avoid it . This is why I think she had other motives which makes her the lowest of the low since she was carrying another life within her .
Heller is about determining the answer to a long standing question on the nature of the Second Amendment , and how much gun control is legally allowed . Roe v. Wade is about finding legal precedent for the murder of unborn children . I see absolutely no comparison between the two .
No , they 're the same species . If you put all these fish in the same pool at the end they would all breed with each other . The example was n't of speciation , merely of a change in a population driven by the environment , which is the essense of evolution .
Except that that would be the author 's words , not a direct quote . Notice the absence of quotation marks ? Special Agent Newell never said `` 17 % came from the US '' . The author has as much trouble with the stats as you . 17 % of the total have been traced to the US . We do n't know the percentage of the total that did indeed come from the US but is untraced or untraceable . See the difference ?
Well when the second amendment was written , `` modern military weapons '' were black powder rifles . Feel free to defend yourself with black powder rifles . In addition , what are the non-recreational benefits of guns . In other words , what would we lose by taking away automatic guns ( since I know your manly self could never part with every weapon you own . )
how is disproving the best explanation scientists can come up with for the diversity of life without divine intervention not an argument for divine intervention ?
Actually , one can argue that it was a pagan institution long before it was a religious one .
That is not the only `` REAL '' evolution . It does occur within a population .
Because the Iliad and Odyssey do not claim to be divine does not mean they should be placed under a different threshold as the Bible . Otherwise , it 's special pleading on your part , and thus logically fallacious . This is one of many inconsistencies between skeptics in regards to the scrutiny of the Bible . They are unwilling to put the standards they have on the Bible against other books similar in age . If they did , there would not be a single book left standing .
Sure let me have your sermon/propaganda of misinformation since it does n't match the context of the Scriptures . propaganda n : information that is spread for the purpose of promoting some cause . mis·in·form Pronunciation Key ( msn-fôrm ) tr.v . mis·in·formed , mis·in·form·ing , mis·in·forms To provide with incorrect information . con·text Pronunciation Key ( kntkst ) n. 1 . The part of a text or statement that surrounds a particular word or passage and determines its meaning . 2 . The circumstances in which an event occurs ; a setting . And since your `` experience '' does not guarantee you to be an expert I will stick to the context which matches what I have said . Job 32 : 4 And Elihu had waited for Job with words , because they were older than he in days . 5 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men , then his anger burned . 6 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said , I am young , and you are very aged ; so I held back and was afraid to make my knowledge known to you . 7 I said , Days will speak , and many years will make wisdom known . 8 But it is a spirit in man giving them perception , even the breath of the Almighty . 9 It is not the great that are wise , nor the aged who perceive justice ; 10 so then I say , Listen to me ; I will declare my knowledge , I also .
No , think about what you just said . A cancer cell does n't mutate , it attacks healthy cells and causes the destruction of healthy tissue . Kinda like liberals in a healthy society - they are the free radicals of the body politic , huh ... go figure .
Because deer do n't live in Africa .
Mongoloid ? Is this 1937 ?
The Grand canyon could not have been created by a flood event , the geology is all wrong : http : //www.talkorigins.org/faqs/icr-science.html The flood explains nothing which can not be explained by other , better-supported means and directly contradicts vast swathes of evidence : Biodivesity and the fossil record are not consistent with the flood . Genetic profiling is not consistent with the flood ( in humans and animals ) The Ark could not hold all animal life . A global mark would have left marks across the entire globe at a consistent time period ; these marks are not found .
No one saw a man 's track for 100 million years . You told me that you had read the material at the links . Did you lie or is it that you did n't understand any of it ? Some of the best `` man tracks '' were found by removing the soil on top of the slab . Some of the tracks were only the shallow impression of the middle part of the tridactyl print . Mr. Carl Baugh claimed these were human tracks . He convinced John Morris of the ICR . After these tracks had been exposed for about 10 years , Glen Kuban invited John Morris back to look again . In some of those tracks the softer infill has since eroded to show clearly the tridactyl nature of the tracks . In others , the infill has changed color by being exposed to the river water . The outline of the entire track is vivible in the stone . John Morris now agrees that there is no track in the river that was made by a human . I am amazed that you went to visit this river and did n't go inside the Park Headquarters . They have a very nice display that explains the history . Also there are signs at various points of access to the river with signs with information . How is it that you paid attention to none of it . But you said in your original post , `` The heel marks are clear as are the arches and in many instances , the toes . '' That just is n't true . You did n't see that in the river . Maybe you stopped at Mr. Carl Baugh 's `` Creation Evidence Museum '' and saw his carved footprint and his cast of a Pleurocoelus print in which he imagines he sees a human track . He gives a lovely ad hoc explanation about how the person slipped and the toes are turned under . I think that maybe you forgot your hat on the day you went to Glen Rose . It 's hot in Texas and you were having delusions if you saw what you claim in the river .
Do you believe that the freedom to not participate in any religion whatsoever is not covered by the expression `` Freedom of Religion '' ?
The concept that science no longer looks at animals boggles my mind . My brother is a wildlife biology major in college meaning his primary focus is ... ... looking at animals and their relationships to one another . It is somewhat understandable that your misconception could arise because molecular biology and genetic engineering are the latest crazes in science . The simple fact is most of the big breakthroughs when studying whole animals have been made . A similar turn has occured in chemistry . I could argue that chemists have subtly turned away from chemical reactions . All the research now is about electron orbitals and nano-structures . The reason for this is these are new fields that are relatively young and many scientists are interested in them . I myself am doing research on buckminster fullerenes . It does n't mean we 've abandoned good old fashioned reactions , we just have more field to play in now .
You 're going to have to do better then that . Here 's a funny comic mocking your position http : //www.filibustercartoons.com/comics/20040824.gif
I think the OP said it pretty well . If an organism or cell can process information and then make decisions based on that information , that 's intelligence .
You may see a vast differene , many do not . The `` moral '' grounds for many is simply the justification for their homophobia .
Same in the US . The father does not have the right to choose .
This is my understanding as well . Interestingly , concepts only approximate that which they intend to define . Confusion between concept and actuality is fertile ground for misunderstanding .
Having human DNA does not necessarily make one a human being . Transgenic animals can have human DNA , does that make them human beings .
um ... gee ... its killing a baby ... now.. before 8 weeks , its not in the form of a human being.. at 4 weeks , its a fish.. at 5.. its a rodent.. but after 8.. its in the shape of a human ... there is no way around that fact .
Not that hard to figure out dude ... What is your proof ?
Well , you have `` proved '' that the U.S. health insurance does not have any higher administrative cost than Medicare or the rest od the industrialized world . I think your problem is that you are convinced in your head that that in our healthcare there is no waste . And you are trying to square it with the obvious fact that our cost is the highest with nothing to show for it . You will have to admit that there is waste . For example we have 5x as many MRI scanners than we need , we perform too many tests , we have high adminstrative cost . All these costs will be reduced . There will be fewer of these things PER INSURED . I do not know how many times I have to repeat this before you get it . The volume of this work PER INSURED will decrease . Do you understand that ?
Well , I 'm a Christian who believes that evolution is a fact . a ) my personal view is that all sentient beings have souls , and that souls are intricately linked with mental awareness/cognisance ( Dolphins , monkeys , apes , octopuses , parrots , etc . ) . So , I 'd say yes we evolved it ( I think god `` attaches '' it to us when our minds develop ) , and it occured with the dawn of sentience . b ) The `` first sin '' is something that has always existed ever since death existed . I do n't view it as a particular event ( Adam and Eve myth is a sort of metaphor or way of talking about it ) . Jesus came to take that sin away , allowing us to overcome death in eternity .
Not this time . That was the previous attempt by the good people of Kansas .
Oh boy , is this what the Anti-gun crowd has come to ? Blaming the NRA for ... a bombing ? I think you have just lost about all credibility with me .
And religious folk in the south used the Bible to justify enslavement of thousands or millions of blacks , and also to justify their treating blacks as mere property . I suppose ( but am not familiar enough with all of the details to know for sure ) that some even used the Bible to justify linching blacks .
Because that would violate the 8th Amendment 's provision outlawing excessive fines , and cruel and unusual punishment .
Government employees are also expected to be fingerprinted but I do n't think any reasonable person would think that is treating them like criminals . In the early period of America most gun owners were required to be government employees by law- they were required to enroll in the militia and received pay for doing so .
Seeing the article you linked to was written in 2002 , over three years ago , do you think the author could perhaps incorporate the new data and rename his piece , `` Maybe There Is Some Truth About Pedophile Priests After All '' ?
Well by the Flood , I assume you are refering to the description given in Genesis ? Fossils we find today have been attributed to a remarkable variety of environmental settings that allowed them to be preserved . Also , you seem to be refering to the preservation of large animals such as terrestrial vertebrates , which are far rarer than fossils of marine organisms with calcarous skeletons . In that regard , some types of rock are basically one huge fossil as most of their composition is derived from dead animal material . There are just so many different types in which creatures are preserved it is not possible to consider the events within the context of a word like `` tragic '' Unusual ? sometimes . In some cases the word inevitable is the most apt . Also , there are quite a few numbers of ways in which animals have been preserved without the direct involvement of water/sedimentation- terrestrial invertebrates trapped in amber , tarpit `` traps '' like those of the famous Rancho la Brea with remarkable preservations of ice-age mammal fauna and mummified animals from desert environments ( off the top of my head ) . Plus then you have a whole set of fossils preserved in water conditions where there has been very slow , low energy deposition of sediments , like black shales and the Lithographic limestones of Solnhofen .
Prove something besides your ignorance ? Homo-erectus and Neandertals differ in cranium size , bone size , bone structure , number of bones as well as the length and width of individual bones . I can see why people are laughing at you
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
So , you are talking an incredibly expensive drug that MAY work 20 % of the time when it is used . Are they just letting these people die ... .giving them morphine for the pain and letting them waste away ? No
It also is n't a baby yet either . It is called a fetus .
There 's a distinct difference ... so what ? No baby at any age can live outside the womb . It still needs care and attention like any other . This difference in age does n't mean anything .
I 'm not surprised . That 's a typical response when someone calls your bluff . Waxy
Well obviously you did n't shoot yourself or somebody else .
What ?
There are contradictions in the bible , for so the bible does n't obey the law of non contradiction . As to the law of identity , Jesus is called both the `` Son of God '' and the `` Son of Man '' , which means Also , many parts of the bible are taken as 'metaphors ' - yet the law of excluded middle should prevent us from doing that . I 'm sure someone will be able to refute my individual points , but on the whole the bible is not an entirely logical source . Furthermore , even if these laws were created by a God , this God does not have to be the same one described in any religion whatsoever . In fact , he does n't have to be omnipotent , so he could even be dead - Atheists could state that God created these laws then died . In which case , God does not exist but Atheists have still accounted for the creation of said laws .
If guns laws do n't affect criminals then how do you explain the low rates of criminal gun use in nations like the UK ?
1 ) It 's Habbit . You could at least take 5 seconds to get my name right . 2 ) Considering you and your friends are the ones complaining , not debating ? 3 ) Actually , none of my posting privileges have my revoked . Try again .

Did n't supersport openly admit he could not prove his own beliefs in divine creation ? For all his dishonesty , you have to admit he 's more honest and forthcoming then Marc or AA have been .
Holland has n't legalised , its decriminalized . This allows drugs to remain in the hands of the dealers , keeping prices high . We need full legalization . The quantity of alcohol use rose during the Prohibition . Not proof that legalising drugs would cut use , but certainly a reason not to assume they 'd rocket .
Even if winnie the poo could read he simply does n't have the brain power to comprehend .
And pro- '' choice '' does n't distort ? That alone shows an unreasonable look on the issue . I agree that many are uneducated about the subject ( which helps the pro-choicers I might add ) and I think many that get an abortion are not educated about whether or not it is morally ok to do . Many have just grown up with it and assumed it to be ok ( which neither side of the issue should support ... there is nothing wrong with education on an issue ) .
So you still choose to believe that someone who 's a victim of crime should be punished as if they committed the crime themselves ?
And you condemn people for dancing in the blood of the victims ? That 's what you seem to be doing since enough information is not provided to draw any conclusions about the relationship between guns and crime . Were n't these police officers armed ? So India should have no gun control laws to disarm dangerous communist rebels ? That 's you 're solution ?
There you go . It 's difficult to find which side of your mouth to talk out of when the facts are the facts !
I 'm sorry but the baby is a part of both of them . Should it be that the mother decides to keep the baby and the father want 's her to terminate the state will still come chasing for child support . Why the father did n't get a say on if the baby was born or not so why should he have to pay child supportbecause the law says so .
Is that not agnostic ? You leave yourself open to change if evidence dictates it . Sorry if this is just turning into word games .
And I just spent all that money on a new camera . Pity .
Oh . You just lost me . The fact is , Jesus warned his followers that they would be persecuted for his sake . Read Matthew 10:5-42 , if you care for the full text . Basically he told them they would be beaten , thrown in prison , crucified , and put to death if they followed him . And that is exactly what happened to the disciples and all those who gave a witness for Christ as Lord and Savior . The various Roman emperors in those years of the early church sought to kill every Christian they could find , men , women , and children . Christians were crucified by the thousands , covered in pitch , and sit afire to provide light for the emporers lavish garden parties . They were killed in the arena by wild animals and tortured to death in numerous ways . They were called martyrs , which now means one who dies for a cause . The word is Greek and means witness . These witnesses for Christ were killed for their faith . How many Christians would we have today if they had to die for their faith ? In spite of everything that the emperor did , they could not kill the Christians fast enough . More were believing in Christ every day , and eventually even the Roman emperor himself became a Christian and Christianity was embraced and sanctioned .
C.S.Lewis believes things on faith , yet we are to use his words , which he is not here to clarify , as evidence that my claim is false , when he obviously accepts the same illogical claim as premise ? His use of the word accident can readily be replaced by `` the natural laws of the universe '' , or other more descriptive terms , without the negative connotation that seems to scare believers . `` We 're an accident ? OMG , then we must right ! `` .
What about the pain and death inflicted upon the innocent women and girls forced to give birth ? Have you no regard for them ?
No . She ( Ohioprof ) is saying that for a person to not look like a complete disgusting hypocrite while arguing against gay marriage on the basis of `` defending Traditional ( TM ) Marriage '' , that person must not engage in behaviours diametrically opposed to said `` Traditional ( TM ) Marriage '' . The strawman you are attempting to construct is just that - a strawman . As to `` the majority of Americans are against gay marriage '' , who really gives a flying ? The majority of Americans thought that slavery was acceptable , that blacks and whites should n't marry , that `` seperate-but-equal '' policies were acceptable ( and equal ) , that women should not have equal rights as men , that discrimination on the basis of gender , race , etc . was acceptable , and on and on . The `` majority of Americans '' have been for a whole lot of pretty ing stupid things . Your argument is n't helped whatsoever with your appeal to majority .
Give it a rest ... what is evident here is more coffeehouse vasilation on your part ... no foam .
Now settle down charlie , and try to think rationally , just for a second . Have you ever heard of a tumor growing into a sentient life form as a fetus does ? I 'd appreciate a link documenting such an occurrence so we pro-lifers can start planning save the tumor rally 's .
How is that silly ? You do realize that the vast majority of firearms used in crimes are stolen no ? And many of those are stolen from legal buyers . While it is a poor argument to argue that firearms should be banned for that primary reason , the underlying principle of control over supply is hardly silly . Unless you think that control over nuclear weapons is silly . Maybe you would . After all , you are Isly .
It works , because we live in a messed up world . In the US , restricting ideas is what does n't work .
And when the President speaks in public we could hand out guns to the audience so that they could respond to any assassination attempt .
I spoke no lies . I can substantiate my position WITH POLLS that actually ask the people leaving WHY they are leaving . Rather than listen to that , Archie would have us listen to people who are ENTRENCHED in REPEATING the very reasons why people are leaving Christianity ... Such glaring misrepresentation of reality is obviously an act of a dinosaur complaining as it sinks into the tar pit . A logical person can very well ask `` If the reason people leave Christianity is because the religion is not adhering to biblical principles , then WHY do we STILL HAVE MOST CHRISTIANS thinking homosexuality is a sin ? '' Cause you see , changes like the above with the Lutherans DO NOT come about because most people WANT the church to be more strict ... They come about because there are MORE people in the church who WANT the change .
This is a completely arbitrary point in time , unrelated to scientific or biblical teachings .
Fossils show inherited change . Adaptation does not .
They are both written in the bible . Neither of them have any evidence ( apart from the bible ) to support their existence . One of them has been proven to be utterly false . This naturally discredits the other , as they appear in the same publication by the same author . Why decide one is true when the other is clearly not , and neither have any other supporting evidence ?
And thats a point of view which has no evidence to support it .
What the Hell kind of a question is that ?
How is that based on experience ? We have no data that says 'an outside world exists ' . The assumption that such a world exists is made before we can use the data .
Well , it is interesting to not that two of the five researchers have ties to the abortion industry . One of them runs an abortion clinic ; another formerly served as an attorney for NARAL . Neither researcher disclosed this information to JAMA . This is an incidence of researcher bias entering into the scientific method . And your belief in this article takes faith . Steve Calvin August 30 , 2005 In the Minneapolis Star-Tribune Last week 's article on fetal pain in the Journal of the American Medical Association proves the desperation of the defenders of unrestricted abortion . The article reviews medical literature and concludes that fetuses are unlikely to feel pain prior to 30 weeks gestation . The authors were clearly motivated to write what I view as a medical fantasy to counter proposed federal legislation that would limit abortion in the second trimester . The legislation would require informing women considering abortion that fetuses beyond 20 weeks feel pain and would require anesthesia for the fetus . Twenty-five years of delivering babies and a specialization in high-risk obstetrics provide me some experience to refute the claim that fetuses feel no pain until 30 weeks . Many of the tiny babies that I deliver , some as small as 1 pound at 23 weeks , have required surgery during their difficult neonatal battle for life . All of them receive anesthesia . Before the 1970s , many newborns , both term and preterm , were operated on without anesthesia in the mistaken belief that they could not feel pain . They certainly could n't tell anyone about their discomfort . With more sophisticated monitoring it became clear that blood pressure and pulse rose dramatically during the trauma of surgery . Subsequently , a subspecialty of pediatric anesthesia developed . Those who deny fetal pain claim that hormonal and withdrawal responses to invasive procedures are mere reflexes and are no evidence of pain . Recently , I performed an amniocentesis on a patient at 21 weeks gestation because of a possible infection . On ultrasound , the fetus pulled away from the needle when it grazed her arm . It is clear to me that this fetus felt discomfort , and that she would feel horrible pain if she were dismembered in the exercise of an unjust constitutional right . The medical literature duel over abortion has been quite one-sided since most of the medical hierarchy is ardently pro-abortion . There are , however , courageous exceptions . The most important medical study on abortion this year got absolutely no media coverage . A French study in the April 2005 British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology convincingly showed that a previous abortion increased the risk of subsequent delivery at 22 to 27 weeks by 70 percent . Premature birth has heavy personal and societal costs , yet the alarm over the increasing rate of prematurity ignores the abortion connection . The fight over requirements for informed consent prior to abortion continues because abortion defenders refuse to accept any restriction on this manufactured constitutional right to exercise prenatal lethal violence . Their blind orthodoxy requires denial of fetal pain and willful ignorance of the significant long-term consequences of abortion . Steve Calvin is a Minneapolis physician .
I know , because I do n't believe there was any primordial ooze at all . But you do . And you also believe that simple celled life formed in that ooze , then evolved into bacteria to enzymes then amino acids , ( not necessarily in that order ) leading to more complex life forms which eventually crawled out of that ooze and breathed air as amphibians , then to reptiles which some how evolved wings to become birds , and through all of this alleged conglomeration of life came mammals after the Dinos were forced into extinction by that big ole comet . And do n't bother telling me that they believe birds came from Dinos because I 'm aware of that belief too . But none of it can be proven at all when all is said and done .
Hate to have to spoil things , but the rest of the world has really no interest at all in Kansas and its scholastic problems
Oh ! Did you mean something like this in gun free France : http : //www.guardian.co.uk/internatio ... ews+-+guardian Those weapons were cheap and from an eastern block country . Machine guns are for sissy American felons . Real felons in gun free France use anti-tank weapons .
Upon reviewing the golden rule `` do unto others as you would have them do unto you '' I see nothing of any other 'side . ' It 's very clear -- treat others the way you 'd want to be treated . No one wants to be treated badly , so if you follow the golden rule , you 'll be benevolent .
Well that 's just like a good darwinist to make a ridiculous challenge . What I can show , however , is that thoughts , emotions and social settings can re-express genes , which can lead not only to a change in phenotype , but also to new , heritable traits passed down to future generations . You guys ' hypothesis that it takes a new or changed gene for `` evolution '' ( ie..change in population over time ) to take place is unsupported , unscientific , un-proven -- and ultimately wrong .
OK. Evolution claims nothing that is outside the realm of the knowable . It 's by that definition , rational . The entire theory , as is all knowledge , is subject to evidence , not being self-contradictory ( as your statements often are ) , and not contradicting some other validated knowledge . Evolution meets these requirements , and is therefore entirely rational . Anything else ?
Well , my reply probably would n't be that polite ...
BECAUSE I SAID SO ! LOL , ... I 'm so silly . I just had to post it . Seriously , I decided that I will actually construct my summary online , Iangb . If you ( or anyone else ) cares to , you will be able to watch as I edit and construct my argument . It may be lengthy so keep it in mind that if I have to divide it up , and you post in the interim , I will have to delete this first half and move it to the end . By the way , ... other than working some things out in my head , ... I do n't have anything prepared to post . This will be a work in progress . ... this will take quite a while . ( Maybe days ) I see you are watching , and do n't want you thinking this will be developing quickly . I will let you know when I 've concluded . -- Chuz *** Note to Ian . In my attempt to compile my 'summary ' I have realized that I never actually completed my arguments . It 's kind of hard to summarize that which has n't already been presented . So , my sumarization if you will- will now consists of two parts . First my arguments and then my summary .

I think hip hop and the arts are reflections of society . It is good to bring these issues to light , if only so that those who would n't normally be aware of them are enlightened .
All sin undermines society , including illicit gay sex sin . Or have you forgotten Sodom and Gomorrah ? Coming to a San Francisco bath house near you .
So you deny that this man is a victim ? Realize that the gunshot drew attention , and attention is something criminals do n't want . Maybe without that gunshot , the guy would 've been beaten to death . But I suppose you 'd be happier , because at least the old man was n't a gun owner . Or I suppose you think he should 've let the criminal have the money ; all that is needed for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing .
Do n't count on it . Republicans do not believe in equality , individual freedom , or human rights . They only kowtow to their religious right masters . If Republicans trully belived in individual freedom , equality , and human rights the would wholeheartedly support this legislation .
Poppycock . How the hell could these people have been able to tell the difference ? Answer : they could n't ( not that there was a difference , because each one was man-made with no divine help ) . Instead , they chose the four that painted their Savior in the best light .
I believe once you have the rights granted persons that they may not be taking away because you are asleep or in a coma . Not unless of course it can be shown that higher brain activity has ceased and there is no reasonable expectation that it could return .
And how does that perspective even deal with the problem of limited ATP production in a low oxygen atmosphere ? I suspect you do n't understand the question . You 're completely avoiding the issue of oxygen in the first place . You do n't even understand the very basics of biology !
Yes , it happened through mutation . What do you mean by `` what sort '' ? I assume you 're looking for something more in depth than `` the genetic sort '' . I 'm afraid I ca n't rattle off the difference in the sequences if that 's what you want . If that 's not what you want than you 'll have to ask a more specific question .
If you want an answer to that , I suggest you read Genesis .
And I am going to say to you one more time , take a class , I am not going to give it to you . There are millions of fossilized links showing slow and obvious changes . Horse fossils show a very gradual evolution to what is today considered the horse ( but oh wait you knew that since you studied evolution so well with such and open mind . ) There is also this little thing called punctuated equilibrium where there is a sudden large change ( usually thought to have been caused by mutation ) But again , since you studied evolution you knew about that .
What , specifically , are you witnessing ? A baby being born ? A prayer apparently being answered ? A near miss ? Mysterious coincidences that you interpret as being the work of God ? Or do you see dead people rising up out of the grave ? And people walking on water ? And people turning water into wine and feeding a crowd with a small amount of food ? What kind of miracles are we talking about here ?
Really , what is the materialistinc approach to which you refer ( assuming you 're also talking about 'pain ' ) ? a ) Is it strictly materialistic , or do they use non-material methods as well ? b ) Can it be used to onbjectively measure pain ?
Oh really ? Parts of New Orleans were under water for more than 40 days before all the water receeded . Has n't the plant life there replenished naturally in the wild ? Of course it has . The Earth is very able to repair itself in spite of modern mans sense of self importance . Here 's some interesting photographic evidence of it . www.pbase.com/andrys/noah
Well , at least accoreding to your `` because I say so '' belief . The woman , of course , do n't need to pay attention to your desire to control her own body in bondage to your particular brand of outraged morality .
To be more accurate , ( not something noted amongst the pro-gun rabble ) the right of protestants to have arms for their defence against catholics . I think we 've all seen quite enough of this `` defence '' in Northern Ireland . ( assuming that yanks can locate the place with a map )
The reality is this is no different the following link : ie ... the animals who were fed one diet passed on traits differently than those who were fed another diet . Traits , according to evolutionists arise RANOCMLY . Get that , geniuses ? RANDOMLY . This is not random . Structural damage in this case did not happen randomly ... .nor did the dengenerative effects to the fur , nervous systems , bones , allergies , and mental processes . Instead this was all dictated by the environment . Thus , despite the emergence of new traits in the milk/cooked food-fed diet of the one population , it had nothing to do with darwinian random mutation or natural selection . This is a hole . A huge hole ... .it 's environmental evolution ... that is , animals simply changing with a changing environment . Lamarckism predicts that the environment changes first , followed up by new traits . Neo-darwinists say that new traits arise before and/or unoriented to the environment , only to be then be selected . I win . And this is no different than the following : http : //www.the-scientist.com/2004/7/5/14/1/ Normally , the fur of agouti mice is yellow , brown , or a calico-like mixture of the two , depending on the number of attached methyl groups . But when Duke University researchers Jirtle and Waterland fed folic acid and other methyl-rich supplements to pregnant mothers , despite the fact that all offspring inherited exactly the same agouti gene ( i.e. , with no nucleotide differences ) , mice who received supplements had offspring with mostly brown fur , whereas mice without supplements gave birth to mostly yellow pups with a higher susceptibility to obesity , diabetes , and cancer . LAMARCKJean-Baptiste Lamarck ( 17441829 ) The environmental ability of epigenetic inheritance may not necessarily bring to mind Lamarckian images of giraffes stretching their necks to reach the treetops ( and then giving birth to progeny with similarly stretched necks ) , but it does give researchers reason to reconsider long-refuted notions about the inheritance of acquired characteristics . Eighteenth-century French naturalist Jean Baptiste de Lamarck proposed that environmental cues could cause phenotypic changes transmittable to offspring . Checkmate , losers . Oh , and by the way , electro-loser ... ..it does n't matter if this diet experiment can be extrapolated to humans or not . ( Of course I realize you are just spouting your mouth off just to hear your head rattle ) ... the reality is , though , these cats evolved new traits by way of non-darwinian mechanisms . So did the mice in both experiments and so did the pigs . Are you truly trying to tell me that cats and mice and pigs evolve by way of the inheritance of acquired characteristics but humans do n't ?
Because they live on a coast ?
If this is the only way you define manhood , then congratulations . You know passion is a tricky thing . It can bring great gains in society , great achievement . It can also bring horrible horrible things , like this writing . You are making a strawman , if you create your own opposition and make them absurd , then it is surely absurd . You know , here 's what I think about abortion . It does n't matter to me . I do n't really care either way . That being said , it is safer to legalize , it is better to regulate it , and ultimately , as men , we do n't get the choice , do we ? The day when you have to walk into that abortion clinic and make that decision , you stand up and tell me what a real man is . Those poor girls and women who go through abortions did what they had to do , more than you could ever do . Do n't stand on your high horse and lecture the world on the virtuousness of your position . Do n't talk about being virtuous , be virtuous . A `` real man '' helps those who he loves , whether he likes what they did . A father loves his sons and daughters , despite what they do , rather in spite of what they have done . Good day to you .
Did n't I just do that above ? Or is it beyond you to comprehend that ! I see no reason to wallow in the mud with you beyond proving my point .
Yes . The first one isolated was a frame-shift mutation on a plasmid . A fairly common source of useful mutations in bacteria .
I think the three points I raised are relevant for the simple reason that Thomson 's argument is an appeal to moral intuition . The violinist argument seems to provide one gut reaction , but if we change the example to allow for active ( or perhaps even passive ) consent by the donor , a different gut reaction may arise . This , by the way , seems to be represented by the majority of people , who seem to be in favor of more restrictions on abortion than is currently the case .
You puritans are always getting your knickers in a twist because someone , somewhere , might be having a good time . What is wrong with recreational sex ? Just because you do n't get any does n't mean you get to rain on other people 's parades .
Of course not . No evolutionary biologist ever claimed that it was . Evolution is a change in the alle frequency in a population over time - like in the case of the peppered moths . Over about 150 years the dark allele increased to almost the entire population and then it decreased again . That is evolution . It is quite apparent that natural selection was the probably cause . You see , no one has proposed another explanation that has stood up to examination . Majerus is trying to verify that the evolution really was the result of predation by birds . It seems a reasonable hypothesis but Majerus had several quibbles with Kettlewell 's methodology even though he believes the hypothesis to be correct .
No . You 've not understood what I said . I do n't know how to make it perfectly clear to you ... the reason the skin color vs. homosexuality analogy is not valid is that one is in 100 % of the cases studied a result of uncontrollable genetic inheritance and the other is generally not .
Sandy do you understand that if a star is one light year away , then we see the light from that star that left the star one year ago ? So the star must be at least one year old .
Technically , all syllogisms need two premises , first of all . `` Step two '' and `` step three '' were a dilemma , not separate steps . Learn to read . Dilemma : You only read Scenario 1 , which was : step two -God can create a rock he can not lift - Step three - God can not lift the rock conclusion - God is not all powerful Scenario Two was - God can not create such a rock - Therefore , there is something God can not do - Therefore , God is not all-powerful The only case in which God could truly be all-powerful is if he can somehow both create an unbreakable rock and then break it , which defies the Law of Non Contradiction and is thus absurd . Thus , the notion of all-powerfulness , which leads to such a notion , is also absurd .
Gliding/Flying ?
This contradicts the fact that logic is an invention born of brain power . If there were no living beings , there would be no logic . There would be plenty to think about but nobody to do any thinking requiring what we know today as logic . Logic is TOTALLY a human construct . ... and since it has nothing at all to do with the existence of God , atheists are just as good at it as the Bible Thumpers . As a matter of fact , I know an atheist who is far more logical than anyone else I 've heard to date .
Then why does n't He answer prayers like He says He will in the Bible ?
Actually Electro , do you remember this thread ? Evidence for a flood ? Oddly enough it took 20 pages before one of them even tried to argue against the reasons why the flood did not occur .
No .
And , what percentage is that ? How was the poll conducted ? Who conducted it ? How was the determination made about who was a 'scientist ' ?
1. militia - the entire body of physically fit civilians eligible by law for military service ; `` their troops were untrained militia '' ; `` Congress shall have power to provide for calling forth the militia '' -- United States Constitution . There is only debate on militia from those who wish to redefine its meaning into something it is n't . 2 . `` The Free State Project is a plan in which 20,000 or more liberty-oriented people will move to New Hampshire , where they may work within the political system to reduce the size and scope of government . The success of the Free State Project would likely entail reductions in burdensome taxation and regulation , reforms in state and local law , an end to federal mandates , and a restoration of constitutional federalism , demonstrating the benefits of liberty to the rest of the nation and the world . '' Working within our political system to bring back liberty minded governance like our founding fathers envisioned . Anarcho-capitialism it is not .
No it does n't , as abortion WAS a legal option in this case . This was not a legality issue , but an education issue .
Yes , it does . Read it all . Also go to this link where an Israeli citizen talks about guns and gun-control in Israel . http : //www.counsel.net/chatboards/2n ... .02.36.24.html Sounds like Israel has strict gun-control laws but also lots of guns . Gun-control has not led to gun confiscation in that nation .
Oh ? And what is the specific amount of pot you have to smoke before you become a drug crazed fiend ?
As for myself , I have serious concerns about research done by Lott . `` Lott has been unable to provide evidence to back up his claim that 98 % of defensive gun uses do n't involve the firing of the weapon . When questioned Lott has changed his story several times about where he got the 98 % statistic from . The validity of other statistics in his book are also in question because he did n't control for such factors as poverty and drug use . David Mustard , co-author of Lott 's study , admitted under oath in Klein v. Mustard that the study left out certain variables which are relevant to the crime rate . Gary Kleck , a pro-gun advocate and researcher , commented on this ' [ More ] likely , the declines in crime , coinciding with relaxation of carry laws were largely attributable to other factors not controlled for in the Lott and Mustard analysis ' ( Targeting Guns ; p. 372 ) .While the case against Lott may not be as strong as the case against Bellesiles , enough questions have been raised about Lott 's book that it would be wise to refrain from relying too much on his research .

Not in matters of atheism . Tell me , when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of Darwin , are the writings of Darwin disregarded ? Or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses ?
I thought you said that you had been following the converstaion . I guess you did n't understand any of it .
A lot of work has been done on that topic . I would recommend reading Debating Design from Darwin to DNA It is a monster of a book , but it is definitely worth the read .
Oh , WW , come on now . If you say something to me about how Vitality works , and I say 'that 's a stupid / simple-minded idea ' , are you seriously telling me you would n't take that as a personal attack ?
Then 99 % of creationists are not informed as far as I can tell . It seems that your position is that `` informed '' creationists are neo-Darwinists , fully accepting of the theories of evolution .
You have a good point about the imporance of the mother being healthy enough to take care of the other children . So often , this debate is phrased in terms of the mother 's rights vs those of the fetus , but we often forget ( including myself ) that other people can also be deeply affected by abortion decisions - including the family which might lose a mother . I would also generally agree that the doctor can often best say what type of health risk exists . Even there , though , the doctor him/herself would have to have some level of judgement about what level of risk is `` acceptable '' and what is n't . Ultimately , someone has to make that decision . Part of the goal of this thread was to discuss what type of risks are acceptable and what are n't .
As I 'm sure you know , the Declaration of Independence states : `` ... all men are created equal , they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . '' Who or what do you consider to be the ( capitalised ) Creator in this text ? More importantly , who do you think the authors of the Declaration considered the Creator to be ? The Declaration certainly seems to tie up the notion of 'inalienable rights ' with religion . No more , I 'm going to bed .
Because , not once , did I have feel any sort of physical attraction to the same gender as myself . I have known other people who have . I do n't 'CHOOSE ' who I think is sexually attractive . It might have been environmental , but it certainly was n't a 'choice ' I have to assume that at least for some , if not most homosexuals , that pattern repeats itself .
Atheists tend to ignore information they do n't like also .
Sure . The woman is a person , and individual , sentient human being . She has the same right to control her bodily resources as any other person does . As such , you can no more force her , against her will , to provide bodily resources to an embryo or fetus , than you can yourself be forced to give of your bodily resources against your will . Even if somebody is bleeding to death , and your blood can save their life , they still do n't have the right to force you to safely give them of your blood . Each person have that right to control their bodily resources . If you want to force the woman to remain pregnant , you are forcing her to give of her bodily resources against her will . When you do n't insist that everybody else be subject to such requirements , then the argument is hypocritical and misogynistic . And , of course the US Supreme Court agrees with this , thus ruling that per the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution , the woman has the right to privacy , to control her onw body .
No , it was based upon the fact we had n't seen one , yet there were fossils of them . Then when we did see the descendants of the fossils and it got changed , that 's how science works , when better data is found , the theories are changed .
Why you quoted me is questionable . What I posted was merely a series of mathematical equations proving that Hovind is completely full of **** . How you consider mathematical equations `` mockery '' I do n't know , but more likely , you did not bother to watch the video . Instead , in your normal fashion , you simply ASSUMED what you wanted to believe and then went from there rather then actually looking at what it was and what it had to say . Your post more accurately is towards the link that AA posted in defense of his beliefs ( yet failed to realize was satirizing those beliefs ) . Furthermore , I 'm not an atheist even though your poor definition wants me to be .
Actually , you are living in the past . That DNA changes is neither an assumption nor a prediction . It is an observation .
Well , if burglars want to steal guns then it makes sense that they would be likely to target the homes of gun owners . And the source is from the recently published book Evaluating Gun Policy which you can read and review . The source is listed at the bottom .
Really ? Let 's consider the matter of Jesus ' claimed virgin birth , a claim brought forth by Matthew long after Paul 's time . Here 's Paul on the subject ... Rom 1:3 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord , which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh ; ... which suggests that Paul considered Jesus ' conception to be fairly routine . EZ , evidence contained within the NT points to a gradual evolution of Christology over a considerable period of time .
If your friend is hearing voices in her head to walk into traffic , she needs some psychiatric help .
But the fact remains that guns are , by design , weapons .
That 's the thing , though ; even a self-professed non-expert can perfectly well refute the ridiculous points supersport continually spouts . supersport , on the other hand , does n't know any better .
And you do n't have any picture . You have no idea of what recessive really means , do you . Actually , since the first observation of a black peppered moth in 1848 , several other mutations have caused other variations of color in peppered moths . They are intermediate between the typica and the carbonaria , but they are extremely rare . These alleles form a hierarchy of dominence in which the carbonaria is the full dominant , and the typica is fully recessive . Please define `` kind . '' Please define `` variation . '' Please explain the origin of this `` variation in kind . ''
Nothing like quoting experts willing to stick their scientific necks out , huh ? Or in your second quote : `` But it now appears the warming from greenhouse gases has been offset by a strong cooling effect from dimming - in effect two of our pollutants have been cancelling each other out . This means that the climate may in fact be more sensitive to the greenhouse effect than previously thought . '' Huh ?
Indeed . Cobb County Georgia . And the sticker was found unconstitutional in Federal Court . The problem was that it was religiously motivated , was placed only in biology texts , did n't say anything true that the teachers were n't already teaching , and actually was not accurate . The sticker was found to be unconstitutional because it violated the second prong of the Lemon Test . I suspect that you do n't know what that is . Anyway , the 11th Circuit reversed .
I think that I do n't have quite enough Tobasco in my Bloody Mary .
Yep thats true . There in separate buildings but right next to each other . I see it being about as attractive as a crack house next to a school with a revolving door in front .
Well , j , the blah blah blah part was pretty important . It said , `` Seife is referring to how information continues to exist in some form after it has been violently altered ; the smoke from a burning newspaper contains data about the newspaper 's content , albeit impossible to reconstruct , and even black holes seem not to truly eradicate the information in the matter they consume . All of which has nothing to do with Dembski 's claim ... '' which is true . One definition has nothing to do with the other . Blah blah blah . http : //www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/903
Me too .
Actually your posts are providing increasing evidence for just how simple folks can get .
Well if it saves my life what is the problem ? ? Are n't we pro life here ? ? ? ? ?
If you literally mean `` kill , '' then you are right . However , many pro-lifers use `` kill '' as a synonym for `` murder . '' Given the strength of your rhetoric , I assumed that you were a pro-lifer equating the choice of abortion with a choice of murder , which is an unsupported controversial assertion . If you meant that a choice to abort is a choice to kill , regardless of the moral status ( murder or non-murder ) of that particular act of killing , then I agree with you , although I 'm not sure why you bothered to say it .
So you 're saying that it 's better to just let the criminals stay armed and the good people should remain unarmed ? That 's advocating to allow the wolf to kill as many sheep as it wants in hopes that it 'll stop on its own and leave the rest alone .
There is nothing racist about the truth . Notice the underlying message in your posted article is about the Court of Appeals throwing her LAWSUIT out . That was the underlying agenda which motivated this racist jerk who also happens to be black . It is common of these people today to refuse to obey the law , then blame the cops for not allowing them to act like they do . Remember that it was she who was speeding in a school zone , then to refuse to give up her keys made her a public safety threat . She deserved what she got even though the thought of a pregnant woman being tasered is scary to me , she could have avoided it by cooperating with the police . I 'm not pregnant and I would cooperate to avoid it . This is why I think she had other motives which makes her the lowest of the low since she was carrying another life within her .
And he has still yet to provide one . If more gun-control means more lives saved then more gun-control means more self preservation .
I think you need to look up euthanasia , and not only for the correct grammar . Those examples are not euthanasia . Abortion is not the same thing as euthanasia . Why do n't you just say what is on your mind , rather than setting these ham-handed traps you hope someone will fall into ? It is clear what your opinion is . If you have something to say , by all means express yourself .
And ... ?
And YET ! The good mayor has the time , money , and extra man power to go to other cities and look for crimes ? Heck . I have been to New York , and he has an awful lot of nerve going anywhere else looking for crimes to solve . And what criminal enterprises has the people of his good city people supplied other cities with . I mean besides the crimes his investigators committed . Drugs , thugs , and murderers to name a few . Bloomberg , stay the heck where you belong !
The 7 day creation I am referring to , not merely the possibility of divine creation through the Big bang etc
So according to you , you 'd prefer it if only the bad guys are armed , because that makes it easy to tell who 's the bad guy and who 's the good guy ; being the good guy is never armed , and thus never able to defend themselves .
And you have yet to prove with statistical evidence that gun shows cause problems . You only have theory and a few isolated incidents .
Why is this clear ?
See my post above , Hi . marc ignores fundamentals of Miller 's beliefs that he clearly spells out in trying to push his anti-Miller argument .
I believe yes , because a robber might not rob a house if he/she knows that their is a gun inside that house .
And if we can actually doing anything about it . From what I hear on the fringes , the debate should not be about how to change or stop it , but how to change to deal with it and what we should expect as society adapts to a change in climate .
Well , JP rightfully pointed out that the percentage of rape victims becoming pregnant are VERY small , so it really does n't carry much weight when trying to argue for the `` right '' to have an abortion
I see . So the Bible is true because you claim it is true .
But behind that are deeper , more fundamental issues about what homosexuality IS and the morality of it . To many people who view homoseuxality as immoral , your movement seems to be trying to write immorality into law .
Ninth Amendment - Unenumerated Rights
Actually in high school I had a friend who used to be in placement . He was sixteen years old an he said he got the s*** beat out of him by an eight year old boy . `` Street kids '' get their XXX beat every day , pain is nothing new to them . It seems they 're immune to it . It does n't matter how hard you can hit , if you ca n't take a punch , then you ca n't call yourself street-worthy .
The biblical end has got to be near . This was a Doctor who spends all of his life saving people 's lives .
Yes . What would a former Archbishop of Canterbury know about Christianity ?
In my reading of the Declaration ( and using the 1st . Amendment as a filter ) it does n't matter who or what the founders meant by `` Creator . '' The conlusion is the same ; regardless . Namely ; The fact that the founders considered our basic rights to be inherrent .
But himps living in the jungle were in competition with other himps which did n't migrate to the plains . And pressures from predators , climate and changes in the ecosystem should have continued to force the need or desire to control their environment as our line of himp grew to do . My point is that with all of the same basic tools to start out with such as fingers , opposable thumbs and walking upright , there is no reason why only our line evolved to the level that human beings have attained with the same hundreds of millions of years , and the same pressures pushing us all forward , or towards extinction .
What is your point ? Should we revert to old laws that allow for slavery ? Over the history of mankind we have struggled to understand God . God has revealled part of Himself to us , but it is difficult for the limited mind to know the unlimited mind . The US had laws enabling this ? Does this mean you were n't a democracy then ? When you were a child , and had total awe of your parents , and believed what they told you , were you less of a person then ? Surely you understand that what your parents taught you then , was a part of you growining and becoming an adult . God for instance calls Himself 'Father ' . This is n't because He has 'male sex organs ' but because it is the best way for us to understand His relationship to us . Likewise , the Jews made laws in order to best live according to God 's Will . They did make mistakes , and got bogged down in the law . Jesus came ( as promised by God ) and liberated us from the entrapment we had set for ourselves . Surely you do n't advocate that we should return to a strict observence of Mosaic laws ?
Good , this is n't the time for either side to be making politically motivated comments , even if the case is over a week old .
Pregnancy is a health issue only for the woman . Your glib remark pretending to sympathy is insulting .
You have a habit of constantly posting statements by anti-gun officials . And when these statements and theories are called into question and challenged , you have nothing to post in defense .
Actually , I think Kronos is right in this case -- at least from the standpoint of most consitutional scholars . Of course the framers did n't envision the wording to be used in this way for this purpose -- this is what 's simply called a `` loophole '' , in this case anyway . It 's why there has been an effort in recent years to close the loophole with a constitutional amendment defining marriage .
And I 'm guessing by your misinformed posts that you have not been high before . Did you recently watch a film called Reefer Madness by any chance ?
So penfold and brady you are in favour of denying citizens rights even though they have not been proved to have commited any crime ? Ed Kennerdy was on that list so should he be discriminated against even though he has commited NO crime ? What is next putting black people on the list purely because of the colour of their skin ? You sicken me you two . Why on gods earth would terrorists be buying civilian guns when they could just use AK47 ? Did you sniff petrol as a youngster as you seem to have .
And the black market where the felon bought it ?
Well so is falling out of a building onto a piece of rebar . Or getting mashed in a car crash . There are a lot more of those than shootings but you do n't seem to care . Why is that ? Is it because you love to dance in blood ?
Given your very poor English ( spelling , punctuation and basic sentence structure ) , I think the assumption that anyone can understand 'exactly what you are saying ' is a very poor one . Smiley PS I have highlighted some of the errors in latest attempt .
Since when are profetallifers `` reasonable people '' ? How reasonable can it be for them to try to impose their particular answer to a metaphysical question on others who believe differently ?
That is about the same for me ( although I never went to church ) , and I find it more of an intellectual stimulation , and I can learn a lot too
To force women to have babys that they dont even want is even more `` preposterous '' .
And from here : http : //evolution.berkeley.edu/evosit ... 1aRandom.shtml
And you have yet to provide stats that prove that gun shows are a threat .
No , it requires pretty much the same amount of faith , as if faith could be quantified . .
Yep . But our ancestors lived in an area of abundant fruit , and we got all we needed from our diets , so it was no big thing when the gene broke . A few non-primate organisms also have it broken , but it 's broken in a different way . Barbarian observes : It 's remarkable then , how much progress we 've made . You may or may not approve of the theory , but it works very well at learning more about biology .
# 1 - Evolution continues today . Some organisms evolve relatively quickly . It has and is being observed . Do some research . # 2 - Science uses hypothesis to explain observed phenomena . It must have happened by itself if there is no Creator . There are several theories about the specifics . I happen to think lightning was involved . # 3 - It is thought humans evolved `` away '' from the other apes due to environmental pressures . When the isthmus of Panama was formed it disrupted ocean currents causing a drying of the region in Africa where we are thought to originate . That change in climate forced our ancestors from the trees which somehow contributed to our `` rapid '' and unprecedented brain development . # 4 - Geology and radioactive isotopes .
I would kind of Like to Discuss your Fascinating use of Caps . But seriously , your numbers are insane . Somewhere around 8000 gay couples have gotten married in the past couple of years , how in the world do you imagine that they 've cost the state hundreds of thousands or millions each ? You just made all that up , did n't you ?
cmitch , you cite certain studies as the reasons for why laws have been passed forbidding underage drinking and gambling . Do you , by chance , know what those studies are ? Furthermore , why would your being legally unable to drink or gamble make you less of a human ? Does drinking and gambling make you more human ? I 'm having difficulties in following your arguments .
And why would I be anti Christianity when I am Christian ? Oh and by the way to who ever it was who said I dont believe in Jesus , or something to that extent , I never said anything to that extent , you just made up what you wanted and got mad about it . I believe in the teachings of Jesus . Yes I 'm betting your asking me how I know about his teachings if I have never read the bible , My mom is someone who has re-read the bible like 6 or 7 times . So shes told me all about it , and what its supposed to teach us .
Wrong . Crocs , more accurately primitive crocs lived with dinosaurs . Modern crocs did not . Crocs came about 200 million years ago , Alligators much much later .
Apart from the 'horizontally instead of vertically ' part which I did n't understand - we 're a hundred or so years too late , unfortunately . You might as well ask for an example of a book or website on cosmology that 'admits ' the sun may just be a big ball of fire pushed by a scarab beetle , and not a nuclear furnace about which the earth orbits . There comes a point where continuing to seriously 'consider ' a viewpoint becomes a waste of time and resources , because sufficient testing has been done and evidence recovered to discount it . We may one day encounter evidence that completely overturns the whole applecart , but so far it has n't happened .
So the Establishment Clause was included to promote atheism , eh ?
no , that 's not what I mean . It 's not like it 's fine to kill anything . I 'm not going to walk up to someone in a coma and kill them just because they ca n't control their actions and think as good as everyone else . It 's just better than walking up to a person walking down the road and stabbing them in the back . It 's just if you got pregnant 'cause of rape or something , do n't you think it would be better toget an abortion when the baby ca n't really think , etc . I know it 's still bad , but it 's better . That 's all I think she 's trying to say , and if not , that 's what I say . I mean , if a 12 year old got pregnant 'cause someone raped her , do n't you think she should get an abortion , and the earliest the better ?
But I do n't hear you saying things like `` baseball is always harmful to the player '' or `` baseball is something no one should have to go through . '' You see , if pro-choicers only used the 'pregnancy-is-bad-if-forced argument , they might have a point , but they often do n't add the last part . Besides , no one ever forces a woman to get pregnant in the first place .
i think shortej is not a creationist . he/she never said so , and started off by saying he/she accepts evolution and maintains her catholic beliefs . ( i have a hunch its `` she '' )
Actually if you were educated in history you would know that Hitler was an evolutionists . If you got that simple trivial thing wrong , why should I trust you in things that I do not know ? Atheistic evolutionist Sir Arthur Keith acknowledged of Hitler : '' The Germal Fuhrer ... is an evolutinoist ; he has consciously sought to make the practice of Germany conform to the theory of eolution . '' ~ Keith , A. , 1947 . `` Evolution and Ethics '' , Putman , New York , p.230.Do n't worry , some of my friends did n't know either . If evolution is true , than it should have some reasonable explanation as to why we have morals , but it does n't .
Excellent point . If the government only gave civil unions to everyone ( heteros and gays alike ) and the churches got to do the religious side of it , Civil Unons would be excellent . Unfortunately , those opposing gay marriage would never agree to such a thing .
So you think the Constitution is `` paranoid '' huh ? You need to read the Federalist and anti- Federalist papers and quotes from our FF .
Actually , try comparing murder rates with those of the UK - was my point , especially murder by gun . You 've got your table of state shootings , and I 've already argued against it .
This is a good site , but very atheist I think . Do you know of a good theistic equivalent ? I do not mean like those awful websites that misrepresent science to try and shoehorn the world into their Bible stories ( sorry to pick on Christians here , but it is Christian ones that I notice ) , but ones that look at real science and look to see if a theistic explaination works for things ?
and for you MIT stat loving freaks : http : //web.mit.edu/~noto/Public/bk_v8.pdf
oh , it 's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys . Nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence ... it 's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism .
Just as being anti-gun wo n't compensate for being born with a small brain .
So what is it that you believe 'we ' think is evil ?
Rather like how a scientist should aspire to behave , really .
Well , it showed how it was physically possible to generate amino acids from inorganic material . That 's rather impressive . Again , irrelevant and unrelated to the Scientific theory of Evolution , regardless of you trying to create that association . Your continued attempt at doing so despite having been shown and told multiple times that the two are unrelated , well that only shows one thing , namely that you are dishonest .
Really ? So , university presidents and trustees -- the overwhelming majority of whom have no connection with evolution , and most of whom are considerably more politically conservative than university faculties -- are behind the whole thing ? Wow . You know , this sort of claim requires evidence . I would like see your evidence of university administration involvement . Got any ? And who are the `` top '' in the peer-review process ? Editors ? Please explain what you mean .
You 've got it backwards , disorder in the universe is increasing , ( see entropy ) . An increase in complexity does not mean there is an increase in organized matter , the opposite is true . A random pile of building material is more complex then a house which is created from that same pile of building materials , because that material is now organized . To make matters worse , organized matter increases entropy because it takes energy to organize it .
Thanks for posting the other side of the story jyoshu . It helps to give a much more balanced look at what happened that night . Here 's a link to Mathis discussing the making of the movie , the process they utilized and how they did n't quote the scientists interviewed out of context at all . The scientists even got the questions they would ask in advance when requested . http : //intelligentdesign.podOmatic.c ... 15_39_42-08_00
And it 's only wishful thinking that they have n't . You are in no better position than I am . You do n't know anymore than I do . Science has admitted that antarctica was much warmer several thousand years ago ... not only that but the following map shows that the continent was not frozen . And if it was not frozen several hundreds years ago ... .and it was not frozen 4-5,000 years ago , as it was stated on this next seal link , then it 's pretty safe to say that animals and humans could have both been there in recent history ( within a few thousand years . ) I agree this is no proof that it was attached , however , it is proof that the weather/temperature was DRASTICALLY different on antarctica than science has admitted ... ..and there 's got to be a reason for this drastic change in temperatures . http : //www.world-mysteries.com/sar_1.htm http : //news.nationalgeographic.com/n ... ent-seals.html In an Antarctic `` ghost town , '' freeze-dried whiskers , skin , and bones provide evidence that the South Pole was a much warmer place not too long ago , a new study reveals . `` We thought , This is really strange . If they are elephant seals , what are they doing here ? '' Hall said . The discovery , scientists say , is the first hard evidence for a warming period in the region between 2,300 and 1,100 years ago . An earlier warming period , between 6,000 and 4,000 years ago , has been recognized by other researchers and is believed to have been widespread , at least throughout the Southern Hemisphere . ( so widespread that there was n't snow on the ground and it was n't frozen over ! )
Sometimes a pregancy means death . Most of the time it does n't . Are we allowed to make this distinction since you brought it up or must we treat every pregnancy as life threatening ?
78.4 years ? Well excuse me but I intend to live much longer than that . I was thinking about 112.7 years . Yeah . That 's about right .
Then you concede that EAM is not scientific , since its premise is philosophical .
Thank God . I too hope it does n't keep going back and forth . While I live across the river in Parkville , Missouri , I used to live in Overland Park Kansas and went to school there . I think they are generally pretty good public schools , it 's just the state school board that keeps effing everything up when they get some christonazis on board .
Obama overturns ban on overseas abortion funding I thought abortion was the fix for bad or no family planning
Paranoia is so ugly . It 's not OK to teach scientific theory but it is OK to tell them that mythology is fact ?
He was n't that special a case . Let 's not forget about Giordano Bruno who was burned at the stake for refusing to recant his idea that that the stars in the sky were all suns with worlds and intellegent beings on them . http : //galileo.rice.edu/chr/bruno.html but alas : It is often maintained that Bruno was executed because of his Copernicanism and his belief in the infinity of inhabited worlds . In fact , we do not know the exact grounds on which he was declared a heretic because his file is missing from the records . All the same , he was burned for being a heretic .
In which you contradict your first clause with the second . You say reason is n't about finding truth ; but separating if from what is false ; which is to find what is truth !
Both . It 's where a human life begins but not a life yet .
Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar 's and to God the things that are God 's . And good moral character is one of the things to render unto God . So , the answer is there is a higher Law than the Constitution . God rules ! And now the verse of the day : A man who remains stiff-necked after many rebukes will suddenly be destroyed -- without remedy . - Proverbs 29:1
Every relationship does entail moral obligations in one way or another , but the argument is that there is no relationship that morally obligates one to share ones body . They are trying to generalize 'moral obligations ' as if that justifies anything . There are things that can not be morally obligated , no matter the relationship , so the argument tries to prove .
Or , spend three months pregnant and then get an abortion , then you lose only one `` potential '' human instead of four . ( WHY MENSTRUAL CYCLES , GOD , WHY ? ! ) NOTE : To clear up any misconception , I am not promoting , condoning , or admitting to the act of rape . This is simply parody of what happens when we use unrealistic standards . I 'm sure that Joe does n't promote the rape of women to prevent the passing of unfertilized ova , but I think that his lack of doing so is inconsistent with his position expounded upon above .
That should be , `` duh '' . I knew what you meant . A bit of humor is ok . But I guess you do n't have anything to say about the implications of this study .
I 'd say no to the first part , and yes to the second . The `` information theory '' argument is something that gets brought up on forums alot , generally by people who do n't know what information theory is , but I 've never seen an `` official '' ID person claim it as a central argument . The basic argument is that stuff , from the universe , to people , to eyeballs , to DNA , is too complex to have `` just happened '' . Someone , ( and they wo n't say God , cause their not trying to be religious here , oh no ... ) must have designed them .
Because she , like every other political figurehead , thinks it 's alright for her to carry a gun , but not anybody else . If she DID N'T support a ban on all firearms , then why did she say `` If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban , picking up every one of them -- Mr. and Mrs. America , turn them all in -- I would have done it . ''

You mean , the perpetrator is convicted and the defender acquitted ? Yes , that 's the rule and not the exception . Notice here how no-one ended up dead , or even particularly seriously injured . Additionally the circumstances described are incredibly rare , that 's why it makes the news .
Well it 's a bit more than that ... .there 's the issue of bad fats too ... ie omega 6 fats . Ever notice how the Omega 3s in Salmon and flaxseed oil are pushed ? ... .you know why ? Because Omega 3 oils , among other things , have an anti-inflammatory effect in the body . Why is it so hard to believe that if a diet that 's high in sugar leads to inflammatory diseases , that a reduction or elimination of sugar would eliminate or drastically reduce those symptoms ? I 'm actually speaking from experience . I did n't dream this stuff up . I 've lived it . I used to have a condition called chronic prostatitis ... which is an inflammation of the prostate that often happens in young men . This is not a medically curable condition . Doctors often throw antibiotics at it , but most men do n't respond to that . As a result there are thousands of men around the country who live in constant , chronic debilitating pain . I used to be one of them . But no longer . I learned the secret , which is to eliminate junk foods and sugars . After just a couple weeks of doing this my constant pain just seemed to evaporate . I have never looked back . Have you ever noticed how some people seem to always be hot , while some are cold ? Some people are just hot natured . Many times older people are cold natured . Do you know why ? It 's from caloric intake . The more calories one consumes , the hotter the oven gets in your body . Calories are just measurements of heat . heat corresponds with inflammation ... inflammation is the source of the problem .
Humans can not cleanse themselves of their sins .
You are welcome to your faith , and you can use it to believe whatever you like , but this continuing misconception of yours that ( on the subject of evolution ) we 're exchanging beliefs and opinions of equal merit can only be counterproductive . Evidence inevitably weighs in , and apart from a single chapter in a single book all of it is landing on my side . Either the whole world is lying to me , or that one chapter is allegorical , misinterpreted or just plain wrong . It does not require faith , bias or belief to be convinced when the evidence is overwhelming . You proudly proclaim you have the faith , the bias , necessary - that 's fine ; as I said you 're welcome to it . But do n't make the mistake of assuming everyone forms their opinions the same way .
Yes , but this is why I brought up the bible , because that would be an alternate reason that would not be caused by homosexual brains that could occur in cultures supportive of homosexuality . I believe that you are right about Japanese culture , if you delved into it you would find there is not a genetic but cultural cause for their high suicide rates , but I believe that you would find the same thing with homosexuality .
Did I claim you did start the thread ? Vitroilic hatred , nope pity is the word you are needing there . No I merely pointed out your style of debate . Which I noticed you made no attempt to say it was wrong . Hence guilty as charged simone . Yep that would be the left 's method for free speech . Speech you do n't want to hear is banned . On the flip side any conservative speech needs a liberal counterpoint . Am I right simone baby ?
Well ... someone has n't been following the campaigns for the so-called `` protection of marriage '' amendments , federal or state .
Well lets speculate about how many possible explanations we could concoct if left to supposition . I 'm talking about the only two explanations for the origins of life that have ever been entertained as viable empirically testable concepts in modern science .
So , evolution is falsified because Ford did n't draft chimps to work the assembly lines ? I 've never seen such nonsense paraded about with such pride . I 'd congratulate you on your win DamEtel , but I 'm more impressed with your patience .
Well , John Roberts is on his way to be the next Chief Justice , and word is , Priscilla Owens is in the bullpen for O'Connor 's seat .
And that is why there is no plutonium found in the natural ( fossil ) fission reactors discovered in Oklo , Gabon in Africa . A fission reaction in the presence of U-238 always produces plutonium . In fact , about 1/3 of the energy output from a typical reactor in the U.S. comes from the fission of plutonium-239 that is created by the fission of U-235 . When there is not enough fissionable material left in the fuel to sustain a reaction , there always remains several isotopes of plutonium that were not present in the original enriched uranium fuel .
That 's so trite that it is meaningless .
You know , I 'm thinking of suggesting that they put a permanent link to an online dictionary on this forum . http : //dictionary.reference.com/search ? q=designed You could take `` intelligently '' to mean that the being is conscious of what it 's doing ; that it 's doing what it is purposefully .
Funny . It is you who have `` abso-freaking-lutely '' no qualms about forcing gays and lesbians to pony up dough for Mr and Mrs. John Q Taxpayers marriage and divorce , all the whie denying them the chance to follow the same course as Mr. and Mrs. John Q . Taxpayer . You my friend are a complete hypocrite . Either give them marriage or quite taxing them to help yours . On another topic , I find it sad that you were ever given the position of moderator with your hateful and dishonest posts like this one . Very glad that it was stripped from you .
I believe abortion is murder and should be illegal . The only possible circumstance when an abortion should be an option is when the LIFE of both the mother and her unborn child is at risk . When both lives are going to be lost , it is better to save one as opposed to losing two . The holocaust on the unborn children of this country is something that we should be ashamed of as a country .
Yes . ( and this is to add stuff to make the post stick ... . )
No , say you 've got 200 of some species . By some event , 100 member are seperated . Now we have two groups of 100 . Each group goes through different selections and they accumulate small changes . Eventually , they will be different enough so that they are no longer able to interbreed . That does n't mean one group automatically has to die so we remain at the same number of species . Of course , one group might get some significant advantage which allows it to come back and ownzor the original area so the other group gets wiped out .
Yes , every living thing is made up of cells .
Yes . ( In a way . ) We are `` in '' the same thing that existed way back then . It has just expanded since then , so it 's much bigger now . .
I disagree for the same reasons I have been giving all along . There may be some legislation that was passed that has kept corporations small ( Anti-trust ) but did it really benefit the society ?
In other words , a cell trying to 'survive , thrive and reproduce ' via a self-induced state of stochastic hypermutation would most likely just end up killing itself ...
Sometimes the state of the education system in the USA makes me cry .
But my point is that the Supreme Court has disagreed . Hence the illegitimate legal doctrine of substantive due process , which maintains that the due process clause can be violated even in cases where due process has been given .
Because feeling safe is n't the same as being safe . The people on the airplanes of September 11th felt safe just before the terrorists took over . The Virginia Tech victims felt safe before they knew about the killer that managed to slaughter 32 innocents . Everyone involved in any major massacre has always had plenty of reason to feel safe right up until the killings took place . But the fact remains that none of them were safe . If they were safe then they would n't have gotten killed . Feeling safe is nothing more than a false sense of security that can be destroyed at any given moment . I 'd rather not be a victim of some violent incident and mistakenly believe that it could never happen to me . I 'd rather actually being safe as opposed to just feeling safe . Feeling safe is just that : just a feeling , it 's not anything tangible , it 's not something that will do you any good if somebody decides that you 're going to be their next target .
I think there are few better things than self-evident irony . I love it .
True .
If this is what passes for American healthcare , then your need for change is even more desperate . None of these `` treatments '' is available on the NHS .
So sorry ; I have a friend who works and lives in the D.C. area , but he has residency in Mass. , because he owns a home there . And he was able to be married only because he owns a home there ?
What are you afraid of , Trebor ? ? The whole world wants to know why you keep avoiding this question : According to your own Jewish Tanakh , is God the Creator of the heavens and earth , and man ? Will he give a pertinent answer or evade it again ? ? I 'm betting he wo n't answer the question .
Minor quibble . Omnipotence merely means that a being is capable of all things . It states nothing about how awkward or difficult these things are . Making a galaxy may require some serious brainsweat , whilst making a person may not ... Anyway , besides that I agree with you !
How were they able to get an `` aggravated assault '' charge pinned on you ? I 'm assuming she never had a mark on herself to show the cops . Had you two had a previous domestic call history with the police ? Hopefully justice will be served when you get your day in court . Then you 'll get to experience the wonder that is `` family court '' , if you have n't already . You have my sympathies .
It 's amazing how little you godless heathens have studied the writings of the founding fathers . Here are just some of the facts that are seldom taught in Americas public school classrooms : The most frequently recognized source for political inspiration for the founding fathers was the Bible , which was referenced in some 34 % of the founding fathers quotations . The first reference to God as the foundation of an American colony was noted in the Mayflower Compact ,  dated November 11 , 1620 :  .Having undertaken for the Glory of God , and advancement of the Christian faith , and the honour of our king and country , a voyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia ; Do by these presents , solemnly and mutually in the presence of God and one another , covenant and combine ourselves together into a Civil Body . Many of the founding fathers recognized that the principles of civil law were inseparably linked to Biblical truths . James Wilson , one of the original Supreme Court Justices , and a signer of the Constitution , explained , Human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is divine Far from being rivals or enemies , religion and law are twin sisters , friends , and mutual assistants  Additionally , the United States Supreme Court specifically recognized America as a Christian nation . In the case Church of the Holy Trinity vs. the United States ( Feb. 29 , 1892 , US457-458 ) , Justice Josiah Brewer , following a lengthy and exhaustive search of early American historical literature , commented , We find everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth .that we are a Christian nation . In another Supreme Court Case , Zorach vs. Clauson ( 1952 , US306 307 313 ) , Justice William O. Douglas categorically stated , We are a religious people and our institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. Further , in United States vs. Macintosh ( 1931 , 283 US 605 , 625 ) , Justice George Sutherland affirmed , We are a Christian people .affording to one another the equal right of religious freedom , and acknowledge with reverence the duty of obedience to the will of God. At the Constitutional Convention on June 28 , 1787 , Benjamin Franklin noted :  The longer I live , the more convincing proofs I see of this truth , that God governs in the affairs of men . And if a sparrow can not fall to the ground without His notice , is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid ? We have been assured , Sir , in the Sacred Writings , that except the Lord build the House , they labor in vain that build it. There are many today who believe Franklin was a strict deist , but Franklin here is not only referencing the Bible , but is alluding in part to a teaching by Jesus Christ from Matthew 10:29 . Concerning the outcome of the American Revolution , John Quincy Adams noted , The highest glory won from the American Revolution was this : it connected , in one indissoluble bond , the principles of civil government with the principles of Christianity. In a letter to Thomas Jefferson dated June 28 , 1813 , John Adams wrote : The general principles on which the ( founding ) fathers achieved independence were the general principles of Christianity. Founding father Noah Webster proclaimed much the same message when he said , The religion which has introduced civil liberty is the religion of Christ and His Apostles This is genuine Christianity and to this we owe our free constitutions of government. Time after time , the founding fathers declared similar beliefs . From the archives of Patrick Henrys personal notes ( handwritten on the back of his copy of the Stamp Act Resolutions ,  made public after his death ) we read : Whether this ( new government ) will prove a blessing or a curse will depend upon the use our people make of the blessings which a gracious God hath bestowed on us . If they are wise they will be great and happy . If they are of a contrary character , they will be miserable . Righteousness alone can exalt them as a nation. Thomas Jefferson was hardly speaking from a strict deist standpoint when he said : Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis , a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of God ? That they are not to be violated but with His wrath ? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just ; and that His justice can not sleep forever. ( Notes on the State of Virginia , 1781 ) I shall need , too , the favor of that Being in whose hands we are , who lead our forefathers , as Israel of old , from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessities and comforts of life. ( Monday , March 4 , 1805 , in his 2nd Inaugural Address ) Remember , a strict deist was one who believed God was like a watchmaker , who wound up the universe and thereafter did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations . Jefferson obviously believed otherwise . Speaking of Godly principles , Jefferson stated : A more beautiful or precious morsel of ethics I have never seen ; it is a document in proof that I am a real Christian , that is to say , a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus. ( Jan. 9 , 1816  In a letter to Charles Thomson ) George Washington , the Father of our Country ,  likewise recognized God as supremely important in the American dream . In his first inaugural address on April 30 , 1789 , Washington remarked : It would be improper to omit , in this first official act , my fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the universe. On Saturday , October 3 , 1789 , President Washington said this in proclaiming a day of national thanksgiving : It is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the Providence of Almighty God. Today , our public schools are in a moral crisis . Washington once noted , If you remove religious principles from the schools you are going to lose national morality. How prophetic he was ! Benjamin Rush , a signer of the Declaration of Independence who was also known as the Father of Public Schools ,  once had this to offer : The only foundation for a republic is religion . Without it there can be no virtue , and without virtue there can be no liberty. Dont miss the significance of that last statement : ..without virtue there can be no liberty . The principle is clear  a lack of virtue engenders bondage . As one writer noted , Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their fetters ( bindings ) . The more liberties a godless people achieve , the more enslaved they ultimately become in their worldly obsessions . Still another founding father , the Reverend John Witherspoon , mirrored Benjamin Rush when he declared ,  Civil liberty can not long be preserved without virtue . And finally , lets not forget James Madison , known as the Chief Architect of U.S. Constitution ,  who once had this to say : Cursed be all that learning that is contrary to the Cross of Christ. This is just a very short list of thousands of such examples that clearly speak of the Biblical and Christian foundations of our Founding Fathers and early America . Along with these there were the church services in government buildings up to and shortly after the civil war ; paid chaplains , government authorized missionaries , reliefs of Moses and the Ten Commandments in the Supreme Court building , and so on and so forth . Whatever moral foundations apart from Christian and Biblical principles one may argue was second , was not even a close second . The record on that is clear . And so today , the debate over the moral foundations of America continues , but not in this quarter . America is in a moral and spiritual decline due to the ungodly secularization of this country . Thou shalt not has been replaced with , If it feels good do it. The wisdom of God has been replaced with the tenets of men ; absolute truths replaced with moral relativism , and Father God has been replaced with Mother Earth. America is now paying the price for this ill-conceived venture . The remedy : A return to Godly values and principles , upon which this nation of the people , by the people , and for the people ,  was clearly founded . ( RighterReport.com )
First of all not all Astronomers believe that . All though it is a very long way to the closest star we really do n't know how far stars are away from us it is not possible to know . It is an educated guess at best . If you base your beliefs on science you will almost always have to change them so are they really beliefs ? Time and distance are 2 different entities . On the other side of the world it is a diffferent day . A light year is the distance light would travel in a year if at the speed we have computed it to be on earth . How gravity affects light in space in pure specualtion as almost all of the cosmological theories are . Black holes were created to explain the big bang . There are lots of astonomers that are convinced the big bang is a myth . If the stars were created near the earth and then streched out as the Bible says they were the relationship of time and distance would be quite different and would explain how light from a distant star could be seen . No one really knows the answer so it is a matter of faith what you decide is true . Both are possible according to science . The powers that be in science are atheist and get the most press . This does not make them right by default . There is a very good book on this subject Starlight and Time if you are interested in what a brilliant scientist who believes in Creation has to say . I will be suprised if you are . I have read Hawkings and have him on audio and video . To be fair you should take some time and study the opposing view IMO .

I think VTs reason for posting that video was to show that this 12 year old girl has more wisdom regarding abortion , and sensitivity to human life than most adults possess today . And she rightfully pointed out the true and very real downsides of what abortions represent for the women who get them . She showed that the human misery of killing more than a million unborn babies a year goes much deeper than just the babies that die from abortions . they affect the mother emotionally as well as her future `` wanted '' children in many cases .
Really ? Why ? From what university did you earn your degree in biology ?
sounds good .
Oh , ok , I can be politically correct if it makes you feel better . How about I refer to them as `` intelligence deficient '' . And I was really not referring to bona fide `` retarded '' individuals ( those with true pathology ) . I agree that there is nothing funny about that . How about I refer to them as people who drive like XXXXXX ... Is that better ?
As a matter of perspective on the above ; Roe is , was and always will be the historical reference for an example of `` judicial activism . '' Roe did not establish the `` right to chose '' if it had , the States could not regulate abortions at all . The activists judges in Roe manufactured law in an attempt to balance the rights of a woman to her privacy against the States right to regulate abortion . Does n't anyone care about researching the facts before theygo running off at the mouth anymore ? Roe v. Wade - Oral Arguments MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST , ( later to become Chief Justice ) dissenting.http : //www.audiocasefiles.com/acf_cases/8960-roe-v-wade `` The Court eschews the history of the Fourteenth Amendment in its reliance on the `` compelling state interest '' test . See Weber v. Aetna Casualty & amp ; Surety Co. . . . ( dissenting opinion ) . But the Court adds a new wrinkle to this test by transposing it from the legal considerations associated with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to this case arising under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . Unless I misapprehend the consequences of this transplanting of the `` compelling state interest test , '' the Court 's opinion will accomplish the seemingly impossible feat of leaving this area of the law more confused than it found it. ``
But what 's best for society is usually best for me , and so I am not disqualified from this debate . That 's why I keep pointing out why it would be a bad thing to enslave people or oppress people because it hurts everyone in the end . That 's what causes wars and crime a lot of the time . So yeah , I do go with what 's best for me , but why should I go with any other way ? If I was a fetus , well who knows what I 'd think . That 's a whole other debate that some other people have already gotten into but which I think is kind of pointless . My whole point is that we kill people every day whether you like it or not , so this whole right to life thing is nonsense . You may not be the one pulling the trigger , but you always contribute to deaths . But we try to select which deaths we cause so that those deaths will lead to the most happiness for everyone else . And I think that allowing abortion does lead to more happiness for society . And before you try to show me polls about abortion to prove that many people disagree with it , and so it causes them unhappiness , that 's not the only thing I 'm talking about . I 'm talking about the unhappiness of the child born into an ungrateful family , the potential criminal problems , and all the other things that have already been mentioned . And yes , those are only potential problems , but that 's how society works . We give people jobs based on their percieved potential , we admit people to college based on potential . You have to go with the odds , it 's simply how life works .
Of course I believe an unborn fetus is simply an unborn child . The only difference is that the unborn has no means of survival without the mother and is not recognized as being a living person . I do n't wish that this child should be killed , but as I said before it can be for the best . And if you really do believe in heaven , then the child is going there anyways . Why would you wish a life of suffering on it instead of being able to skip all that and go straight to heaven ? This is the type of logic that works against those who believe in a soul since it really does n't make much sense to live on Earth when heaven is a million billion times better . Just to answer your question with a question , how do you know a child would choose life over death when it has never lived ? People commit suicide everyday but I 'm sure they would also choose life over death if they had been in a better situation . Perhaps this is being too extreme . A person would likely choose to live when faced with death , but whether it logically make sense is another question . People will try to live through starvation , sickness , and misery because it is what their mind tells them to do . Is it really best that they are alive ?
ah yes ... the `` what 's your point '' defense -- even though you just read my point ... which was the blacks got a later start under the darwin plan of evolution -- which prompted the whole `` out of africa '' version evolution so they could avoid their theory being labled as racist . That 's the point ... it was right in front of you . What 's your point for asking such a dumb question ?
Yes , and in as short & amp ; nice a way as I could , I told the docs ( in the vernacular ) , to 'shut-up ' . Now granted , their 'ego ' ca n't take it : How dare I stand-UP ! for *my body* they assume they own while on their turf , and How dare I stand-UP ! for *my daughter 's body* they assume they own while on their turf . Course , they 're not used to that . They 're used to people meekly complying with `` whatever you say , Doc - afterall , you 're God '' . NOT . And countless other medical docs also exist , who *Honor LIFE* , as in `` Pro-LIFE docs '' . The latter would n't think of dis-empowering people as too many still do . ( as 2 atty 's would tell me later `` Annie , if you could ~ yes you would protect/empower each little , vulnerable person in this world , but you ca n't . So , you keep doing what you can , as well as you are , peaceful soul '' ) .
Is that all you 've got ?
Well , the funny thing is ... if he 's so public about his plans and even if he succeeds a little , the SEC will probably come in and bankrupt he and his flock and ruin the rest of their lives . He probably would end up facing a fair amount of jail time . Stock manipulation is illegal . And a giant like Microsoft will be out for blood . His being so vocal about it is probably the dumbest thing he could do . This guy is not playing with a very bright bulb . And , yes , you 'd think that he 'd be pouring all his energy into feeding the poor , helping New Orleans recover from Hurricane George . Some of these christian folk have their priorities so twisted it makes me sick .
So stop relying on press reports . The original paper is at sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/317/5835/214.pdf ( add the standard prefixes )
What ? Sinjin Dude ! Your devotion to the Democratic Party , and sticking up for your guy is admarable , but come on ! It says `` In actuality , according to ATF special agent William Newell , about 17 percent of guns associated with crime in Mexico came from the United States . '' Are you calling the author a liar ? Are you accusing him of journalistic fraud ? If this is true , you should be . You know , if agent William Newell did not actually say that , this author will be fired . William Newell himself will tell every other news outlet that he did not say that ! Are you , perhaps , a bit too zealous in standing up for your guy ? Maybe you will watch this carefully , and post the story if his firing , or at the very least , his retraction . Or perhaps William Newell 's statement condemning this Journalistic Fraud , if that is what it is . Man would THAT help your credibility right now . But alas , that retraction , that statement nor his firing will ever come . Although , it sure has been fun watching you dig yourself into a hole , and shred your credibility over this ATF . Obama and Obama cabinet or whom ever , Exaggeration in order to Ban Assault Weapons ! It 's OK Sinjin . The American people already know ! Senator John Kerry was the one who let this ( What is the word ? uh ) discrepancy out of the bag . Kerry qoute
Are you sure ? What about animals that had a combination of both long and short hair . Such fur would function more efficiently as insulation that either long or short alone .
Just so we 're all clear ... Wolverine 's mutant power was the ability to regenerate . The claws had nothing to do with his power but because of his power , he could automatically heal after retracting the claws .
Please stop making statements that have nothing whatsoever to do with the debate at hand . We 're not talking about Christian fundamentalism and `` reality '' .
So , you are n't going to post any proof here . How typical . You also did n't address the rest of my post .
I think you present a good point , but part of the test here is to see how my post is reponded to ; silence from certain people tells us things in inself . So far it seems my initial estimation of the issue is about right- the idelogy being upheld helps some people ignore the effect the punitive policy imposes .
Why should I prove anything , you never do .
And way too many of them . Of course what do you expect witht the state run media , a solid lock on education to the point of propaganda and massive voter fraud . They do n't say the graveyards in Cook County IL vote early and often for nothing .
Actually the injunction is in place until the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decides . After that point , and if they decide the ruling was correct , then the injunction is done with ( unless the 9th circuit issues its own similar injunction ) . It 's not going to go straight to the Supreme Court . And , unless I 'm mistaken , I believe that if the 9th circuit agrees such a law is unconstitutional , the areas they preside over that have similar laws will have those made null by that decision . IIRC that 's how it works .
Without a doubt Peter is my favorite in the NT . Acts 2 is a shocking turn of events , when on the day of Pentecost 3,000 believed in Jesus as the Jewish Messiah , and were saved and received the power of the Holy Spirit . Truly God used the lowest and most worthless and in Peter 's lowest , God used the occassion for the highest Good . And , at the end of his life , he asked to be cruicified upside down ( a merciful request , BTW ) - who could make this scenario up ? Why would 3,000 Jews believe in a dead Messiah ? Why was the tomb empty ? If Jesus was not the Messiah , who could believe the Gospel ? Why would anyone risk being a Jewish heretic , and being cast out of Jerusalem ? Acts 7 if memory serves me , or 8,9 as the believers in `` The Way '' - Jews for Jesus as it were , were expelled from Jerusalem . Some did stay behind with James , who was later beheaded 40 - 50 A.D. or so . More for tomorrow ... ... .L8r , Rich
It used to mean that , now it is just a screen name . I was a big fan of AMD back when I was invested in them . They are still a decent company but they ca n't seem to keep up with Intel . I like your screen name as well . Im guessing you got the idea from Braveheart which is my favorite movie of all time !
Well , here is my take on it . I really believe that only the truly evil end up in Hell . Those like Hitler . I think that anyone else goes to heaven - Wiccans , Atheists , Buddhists , etc . - anyone who follows Christ 's message of love , tolerance , and acceptance , whether knowingly or not . Those who preach hate , and those who act on that hate , like Hitler , the KKK , and any other person/persons filled with hate ( sad to say , this seems to apply to our own friend Archie here ) are the ones who will end up in hell .
So the police can be there instantly if you have an intruder ? They can respond before you even call them ? Wow , you have some fast-responding police ! That 's fine if that 's what you want . But I 'd prefer take personal responsibility for myself and my family , thank you , rather than trust the police who may or may not be reliable , trustworthy , and likely wo n't be there fast enough to stop an attack before it happens .
So they decided to focus on the dicta in Miller rather than the holding ? I wondered how Heller would handle or get around the machine gun question if they decided to go the individual right route especially in light of the civic purpose of the Second Amendment . Heller seemed to me to say that the right is not limited to its civic purpose but can be more limited than its civic purpose .
it means you can join the national guard , get a clue .
i like your point on faith and believing in something bigger than yourself . i think man has an instinctive drive to better himself . and everyone believes in something bigger than himself , and its totally in the mind . for some its God . for some its their dreams . for some its their family , community , country , future generations of mankind . whatever it is , it is absolutely based on faith , and it is an element that pushes you to better yourself . faith in something bigger than yourself inspires improvement and self esteem , and i think everybody needs it
Do the Christians that you know that believe in evolution , believe that there was no first man named Adam , or that there was no Genesis flood ? The term `` evolution '' needs to be narrowed down - more clearly defined , for these discussions .
Now , I could ask the same thing .
You 're still yet to show evidence for this . You have yet to post a 'reason ' other than re-stating your belief . On that post I put forward ( in Posts # 40 , # 46 , and # 66 ) evidence that agrees with my stance .
Then by that standard , christianity is horse puckey ! Christians contradict each other . Oh ! But wait . Anyone who disagrees with you is n't `` really '' a christian .
And before Heller , numerous judges declared that the Second Amendment was nothing more than a collective right that belonged to the states , giving them permission to have private militia armies for their own defense . In the end though , both they , and Wilkinson are wrong and their opinions matter not .
religion : commitment or devotion to religious faith or OBSERVANCE religious : relating to or manifesting faithful devotion to an acknowledged ULTIMATE REALITY or diety Therefore we can conclude that atheism and agnosticism are religions .
I agree , that is one very important question the article does not address . I 've not been able to Google any answer either ; perhaps it is something that is undisclosed .
No , it certainly does n't . It has the Book of Genesis , which is n't `` backing '' because its the story itself . Every other mythological analogue has equal ( i.e . none whatsoever ) `` historical backing , '' but you 're specially pleading for your personal preference .
A fingernail is human . Big deal
I 'd say there were a lot of stones going both ways . Do you know the Rev . well enough to be able to make that claim , that he 's a bigot ? Or is it he represents the system ?
Science is the current sum of human knowledge about how the world works .
Teehee . Nice .
And teenagers consistently prove why they do n't deserve the right to vote .
And rightfully so .
Well he did invoke use and disuse ( not necessarily intelligence ) along with his theory of pangenesis but he was incorrect in both instances . After all he was shooting in the dark in a highly speculative way with regard to the mechanisms of both variability and inheritance . Its unfortunate he was not aware of the contemporary work of Mendel , but them is the breaks . Its quite obvious that molecular biology and genetics have moved leagues beyond Darwins level of information . And what you believe natural selection can and can not achieve is moot its capabilities are well known and nicely demonstrable both in theory and in practice . Vast tomes of empirical evidence says your belief is not valid .
Really now . You 've gone out on a limb with nonsense http : //www.earlychristianwritings.com/ lists many books , only a few of which are in the Bible . Further ( at http : //www.earlychristianwritings.com/theories.html ) it lists a whole range of theorists believing in the historical Jesus .
Because they refuse to let openly gay fathers join because they cry pedophile ... ..
He did n't ! I hope you reported that to the admin
It 's worth noting that all children are in a stage of growth and further development , ... not just those who are still in the womb .
Nope a true believer will insist on his belief system even in the presense of overwheliming contrary evidence . So far you have not managed to produce andy such evidence to the contrary . Should you do so in a rational scientific way which can be verified then Darwinists will throw down the theory and join you in your conclusions with verve . I am not however going to wait for it to happen . Tis up to you .
Proving , yet again , some Democrats are , after all , honorable men and women .
YOU ARE WONDERFUL !
A woman can think was she wants but it is still a human being . Killing parasites was often the argument for eugenics ya know ... a parasite on society ... just thought I 'd let that slip . Nevertheless , I think the woman should have the choice..and she does . However , if she makes the choice to kill another human being we should punish her or whoever did it .
Just another anti-gun Blogger . I could go on , but doing so would boar the heck out of everyone , to include me !
So it seems that the framers of the Constitution did n't think that a Bible was necessary .
so we are making progress . It seems that SS is now admitting that evolution by natural selection really does happen . He admits that his examples are not what he claims they are . We also see that he objects for religious rather than scientific reasons and is aware of it . Good for you SS . Sadly , he seems to be falling back on that old creationist saw about `` where are the intermediates . ''
Well that 's a real holy XXXX moment right there . Seems that all these people who 're continually whining about how gun owners have to be compelled by law to report the loss of a weapon , just need to shut the hell up and look at the police and authorities first .
The only arguement I hear from these links against embryonic stem cell research is that , in ten years , it has n't yielded sufficient results for human trials . If that is your only arguement against its scientific viability then it is a weak one . Many technologies , biological ones included , can take a long time to develop . Certainly , the adult repair stem cells that are mentioned in your articles may have their uses and sound as if they also deserve research money . However , one can not just listen to one side of the story to make a decision . The scientists researching repair stem cells , patients who benefited from them , and doctors who use them are obviously going to sing its praises when it does introduce some gain . However , the embryonic stem cells might have even more potential , given the time and money to develop the technology . So , unless you can show me evidence that embryonic stem cells will never achieve their potential or that repair stem cells can achieve everything that embryonic stem cells are hoped to achieve , then your arguement against embryonic stem cell research continues to be unconvincing .
I 'm not sure what the threshold for gezzerdom is , but I fear I have passed it . Dono
Are there truly laws of logic ? Where are they encoded ?
That 's just great . You think it is cruel to abort a fetus when the life of the mother is in danger . So what your really saying is : `` Oh just let the chick die , save that baby '' . It strikes me as strange that you do n't think letting that woman die would be cruel , or that the baby growing up without his mother would be cruel . And there would be no reason to do it to a `` born baby '' . If they are already born , you can not perform an abortion . And I think it is sickening that in this so called `` land of the free '' that there would even be an argument against an abortion done to prevent the death of the mother , or abortions done in the case of rape . I would think that the land of the free and the right to choose would go hand in hand . And let me ask you , with your demented , self righteous views , do you celebrate your birth date or your conception date ?
Experience contradicts previously accepted experience . That 's how science evolves . Science . Evolves .
Then you are sortsighted indeed . The shooting sports are a great way to channel aggression . Sporting clays , trap , skeet , cowboy action shooting , steel matches etc . Reactionary targets , loud noise what better way to channel aggression into a non-lethal activity .
Evidence ?
and a conjecture is ;
But what form of creationism ? Who 's god ? Are you going to limit the age of the earth to 6,000 years and have a magic being do it all in 6 days ? Why do n't you specify what form of creationism you advocate ?
I know exactly what you were saying . And it seems I was right , you have nothing to back up your claim that people were betting that it would fail . It 's just something you 're `` sure '' of , i.e . something you made up . Like I figured .
America isnot supposed to be a copy off of all the other countrys , and it shouldnt . Just because its the popular law that something should or should not be done does not mean that it is the right law . In fact , if you knew anything about your own country , it was made FOR the freedoms which the rest of the world lacked , and slowly those freedoms are being taken away . And as for the harm ... More harmful then tobacco ? Where did you get this ? Give some proof to back yourself up . The fact is , the THC in marijuana reduces the effects of cancer to the point that cancerous sicknesses coming from the marijuana ( that means the weed itself- it doesnt include tobacco-caused cancer , etc ) to a point that it would take 200 years to die from . Otherwise , it would take about 20,000 pounds of marijuana smoked in fifteen minutes to die from , which is due to the thickness of the smoke , not what the smoke came from .
I think you fail to take into account that for most opposers of abortion , they genuinely feel they are trying to save lives by their opposition . In many cases it 's not a matter of trying control sexual prermissiveness in society but preventing lives from being killed . Disagree or not , you ca n't separate the anti-abortion message from the fact that it holds to the view that abortion is a form of murder .
I will not give up my right to vote . I will not give up my firearms . I consider people taking my right to firearms as dangers as people trying to take away my right to vote . In other places around the world , firearms are much more important than the right to vote . There are people around the world trying to get a chance to vote by using firearms to establish a system where they can use the right to vote . For self-preservation ? I will use a bazooka if there is tank comming down the street . The immediate threat I am thinking of is a felon with bare hands on parole . That is exactly what the anti-gunners are trying to limit me from doing . Limit my right to self-preservation from a felon on parole . If you read the other threads , especially from VOR , you will see he is about confiscation not gun regulation . I have asked many anti-gunners about confiscation , when they point to models of UK and Austraila I shudder . Those countries are not about regulation , they are about confiscation .
In fact , the period when theology was the `` queen of the sciences '' we generally refer to as the `` dark ages . '' Science in the modern sense is only about 400 years old . You can get a hint of how the `` queen of the sciences '' operated by the fact that Copernicus ( a priest ) withheld publication of his heliocentric theory until he was quite certain that he was close to death ; in fact , legend has it that he saw the first copy on the morning of his death . He knew what the consequences of his theory , that flew in the face of the geocentric dogma of the `` queen of the sciences '' , would be . Giordano Bruno and Galileo both found out the consequences of stating theories that were in conflict with the `` queen of the sciences . '' Only when science broke free of the domination by the Church were scientists free to follow the data to the conclusions rather than begin with the conclusions did real science develop and begin to develope real scientific theories . `` Creation science '' still begins with the conclusions and then tries to find data that will fit the dogma , even if it is sometimes contradictory . In `` creation science '' there is no hyopthesis , no prediction , and not test with the power to falsify the hypothesis . `` Creation science '' is pseudoscience .
Well , given that your term is a fabrication of the creationist 's mind , I suppose you 're right . Evolutionists do n't actually exist . Therefore you could assign whatever traits you wanted to them , including dishonesty . Evolutionist is a term designed to cast evolution as a faith based notion . The problem is there is no faith in evolution , faith is a belief in something with no proof . Evolution has proof . Therefore it can not be a faith based idea . A typical creationist attack is to misrepresent their target by creating a strawman of it . They then declare it is wrong and by proxy , the actual theory wrong . It 's fundementally weak , but inline with a belief that is scientifically unsound .
why ?
Well , it depends on your definition of retarded I guess . The standards to get a drivers license are really not that high . Think of how dumb the average person is , and realize that 50 % of people are dumber than that . Kinda makes you cringe . And you wonder what has prevented me from being in an accident ? Well , perhaps the fact that I am a concientious , defensive , and skilled driver who excercises caution while on the road . Maybe next time someone pulls out in front of me , I should just throw my hands in the air and scream `` take the wheel jesus ! '' I am sure some magical being will fly down from heaven and save me from crashing . Yeah ... sure .
Actually , the biological development begins when the ovum is formed , when its mom is a fetus herself .
Because I am one who likes see things from different angles . What better way to fight your enemies then to understand their viewpoint . Before I am attacked on the the last statement , just because I understand a viewpoint does not meant that I accept it as true or that I do n't reject it .
Sure , here ya go ... Radiocarbon Dating
I think you mean to say is hunters not liberal democrat hunters . Actualy I know of very few hunters that only have rifles or shot guns they usualy also have pistols to since you can hunt with them also .
The national guard is related to a standing army under the control of the government , a militia is not genius .
The process of evolution has no scientifically known teleology and follows no known predestined plan . It does not teach that there can not be any such things as teleology or forethought . This is where your mistake lies .
No . It 's not going over my head . I am pointing out something that is a more apt analogy . You just do n't like it , cause your analogy does n't involve somebody being refused service , so you prefer your inaccurate analogy over mine which is more apt . Me giving a better analogy is not something `` going over my head '' ...
And those pillars will be replaced by something stronger like equality and Justice .
Sartre , you know little of history . Until relatively recently within the history of humankind , the Romans adhered to the rule of paterfamilia in which the supreme patriarch of a clan -- oh , how they loved their males , men were next to God in their eyes , a tradition which lives on within the Roman Catholic Church -- ruled on the existence of infants within his clan . If he chose , this next to God male , the infant lived and received shelter and nurturance . If he chose not , the child was abandoned to sate the hunger of wild animals or , perhaps , might be saved by a kindly human wayfarer . In many cases these wayfarers were not so kind and the child may have been severely abused , used as a sexual toy -- hmmm , kind of reminds me of the situation for inner city children in very Roman Catholic Brazil . Interesting .
Creationists need to latch on to the intellectual integrity of science . They know that if they can represent their claims as `` scientific '' , many people who otherwise would ignore them will pay attention to their incredible claims . To put it crudely , the creationists seek a ride on the science bandwagon .
Is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one 's hand ? Is Sarah Palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter ?
Oh . Then you 're just a dupe rather than being dishonest . Your information comes from a moonie . Funny that the Discovery Institute does n't mention that . The fact that he decided to study biology with the express purpose of disproving evolution . So he had made up his mind that it was wrong before he undertook to find out what is was . Wells was encouraged by the Rev . Moon . He is known selective presentation of data .
Like you were raised ? Looks like it did n't work and now those hormones must be kicking in ? Nothing worse than a menopausal female grinding her ax ... their favorite victims ? Males .
So would you care if abortion were outlawed . If so , what would be bad about allowing a view that places objective value in human life to be the basis for making law ?
I think that environmental and political concerns should certainly take part in these decisions , though I will not go so far as to assign their importance . Yes , there should be freedom of choice , but should your choices infringe on another 's ? If we 're talking in thirty feetses , sure as heck , i want you to stay out of mine ! But there are always other circumstances . Should a wealthy landowner deeded with several acres be entitled to have as many kids as his land will support ? maybe . Should a wealthy woman with tons of money be able to have as many kids as her pocket will allow ? maybe But on the other hand , should a poor woman without two red cents to rub together be required to abort her very loved and wanted child ? probably not .
** Again , sez u .
It 's remarkable then , how much progress we 've made . You may or may not approve of the theory , but it works very well at learning more about biology .
Actually they apologised because its a bit of a fad amongst the limp-wristed politicians at the moment . And anyway , the blood is fairly even on both sides .
People who are sterile ca n't breed .
Kudos to them for stepping up to the plate . A part of me thinks it 's sad that it has come to this , and will surely develop further , but part of me thinks this is just the sort of thing needed . Most creationists do n't realize that they are creationists . Maybe more of them will start to prod and ask questions of people like museum curators , and perhaps some of them will leave with a broader science knowlege . Actually , I might begin to believe that this upwelling of support for young earth creationism and intellegent design creationism might have its benefits . If more and more people come out of the woodwork and inadvertantly admit that they are scientifically illiterate by hitting people like museum curators and teachers with creationist arguments against evolution , then maybe more of them will debate the topic long enough to have an epiphone . They might just realize they had been blinded by faith , not in their god or holy book , but by what preacher Joe down the corner had told them .
The Bill Of Rights ~ The First Ten Amendments to the Constitution
Why is it left to me to have to respond to this ? I guess the question is , what is she petrified of ?
Oh , WJA , what a neat little trick . The claim had been made by your side ... that he had n't published an attempt to apply his filter . And , that he was running scarred . Are you now asking me to show where he has successfully demonstrated his filter , or are you asking me if he 's attempted to demonstrate his filter ... ? And now you want his publication in a particular form too ! Another slight of hand . Despite this I countered that he has published . I said Dembski had come up with a filter The accusation was that he had n't applied this to a biological system . Yet everyone seems to be able to critique this 'invisible ' application . Now with typical aplomb WJA chimes in and you do n't go down the path of SLP in actually making any claim . You want me to come up with the goods . This is the neat trick . You 've diverted things away from SLP 's ludicrous and biased claim . The claim was made by SLP without any proof . The onus is on SLP to provide such proof . I have shown otherwise even if it is 'second hand evidence ' . The inference from all the critiques quite clearly suggest that they have seen it applied , and reject it as a failure . Nice try WJA . A small shift again of the argument . However , because I 'm trying to educate you I suggest your read the following . `` In the actual encounter , Dembski began by overviewing his methods for design detection as developed in The Design Inference . He then sketched how these methods apply to biology and why he thought they provided in-principle objections to undirected natural causes , including Kauffman 's self-organizational processes , generating the key item that his methods detect , namely , specified complexity or complex specified information . Dembski developed his argument as follows : the only way for self-organizational , Darwinian , and other naturalistic methods to generate specified complexity is by in essence dissolving the actual complexity ( or improbability ) . What seems highly improbable is therefore no longer improbable once one knows the right naturalistic process . Dembski indicated that there were good reasons to think that no such reduction of complexity or improbability would be possible in the case of systems like the bacterial flagellum . He also adverted to some of the techniques developed in his forthcoming book titled `` No Free Lunch '' for computing the probabilities of discrete combinatorial objects like the bacterial flagellum. `` http : //www.arn.org/docs/pjweekly/pj_weekly_011119.htm This suggests that a book is about to appear mysteriously out of the ether ... So , go read the book `` No Free Lunch : Why Specified Complexity Can not Be Purchased Without Intelligence '' . Unless you think it 's not 'published ' . Oh , look it has been published ! It 's a miracle . As far back as post 29 the answer was provided for one and all by SLP who wrote : `` Unfortunately , Dembski and his `` explanatory '' filter are more hot air than substance . He has claiming to have 'discovered ' desing ( sic ) in nature by using the 'filter ' , but for some strange reason , he has yet to publish his amazing discovery . he said he was going to do it in `` Mere Creation '' , then he said it would be iun ( sic ) No Free Lunch - so tell us , IS IT actually in his newest collection of apocryphal tall tales , or is is ( sic ) just assumed that he has done so ? '' The simple answer is 'yes he has ' . This mystery book exists . It 's even been criticised by people on your side `` In his book , No Free Lunch , Dembski presents the bacterial flagellum as the premier example of a biological system that , because he judges it to be both complex and specified , must have been actualized by the form-conferring action of an unembodied intelligent agent . However , a critical examination of Dembski ? s case reveals that , 1 ) is is built on unorthodox and inconsistently applied definitions of both ? complex ? and ? specified , ? 2 ) it employs a concept of the flagellum ? s assembly that is radically out of touch with contemporary genetics and developmental biology , and 3 ) it fails to demonstrate that the flagellum is either ? complex ? or ? specified ? in the manner required to make his case . If the bacterial flagellum is supposed to demonstrate ID , then ID is a failure . '' http : //www.iscid.org/ubbcgi/ultimate ... =1 ; t=000057 ; p= As I said , people on your side are out there criticising him all the time . How could they unless he had published ? Also , it is one thing to say that he has n't attempted to apply the filter , then to say that he has attempted to apply it and failed . Game , set and match
Garbage pure and simple . Science is materialist and empirical by its very nature . A non-materialist science is a contradiction in terms and WW you are well aware of it . What you present as a threory is empirically false and you are well aware of that also .
So then how do you know that abortion is n't in the plan then ? If as you say we have `` VERY LIMITED PERSPECTIVE ''
We accept your word .
I think I remember seeing some post concerning that . It think it went to the affect of the buy back paid only a fraction of what the weapon was worth . But anyways I hope it never does happen here . A voluntary buy back is fine but a forced one should n't be considered . I do n't believe the government will make it a policy to increase gun controls to the level where it is forcing people to get rid of guns . I think they realize the 2nd amendment is strongly against this and they would get called on it .
Maybe they did it on purpose ? They push through the amendment to quiet the RR while the issue is a hot botton topic , but make sure it 's unconstitutional so that it 'll get shot down . Just a thought .
Well , if my points in this thread are so easy to refute then why do you focus on addressing arguments made in another thread ? I 'm not fooled by anyone who claims to have a winning hand but wo n't show others his cards .
So much about complexity on earth has been discovered since Darwin , yet comparatively little more complexity has been discovered in all the dead rock planets all around us . But Darwinism will always be the faithful beginning point for atheism , just as the Bible is for us .
Said like a lazy , ignorant person who would rather live off the sweat of others than go out and earn for himself .
You 're starting to sound like someone who understands evolution . I do n't see your argument here , you 're basically supporting the steps necessary for natural selection . What you describe is one small step for evolution , you just have to repeat this 1,000,000 times over various other environmental and competitive contraints and viola , you 'll probably see evolution at work on a scale that you can recognize . You 're almost there montalban ! -Mach
Yes Peeling ; you say this with such assurance , yet what you ca n't explain with any assurance is why only one offshoot of the Primate genus evolved into what human beings are today . Why only us , when we all allegedly started in the same environment with the same ecosystems putting the same pressures on us . What I 'm saying is that in every place where our alleged primate ancestors fossils have been found , so have n't the fossils of animals described as lower primates been found . So your explanation that one species evolved while another stagnated or died out rings hollow with me . Especially since you can actually prove absolutely none of this . Ca n't you see that Peeling ? None of this is provable .
Since it was n't thought up by Hubble , the rest of your post does n't follow .
Thats an odd analogy . Can a child survive without its mother ? I 'd say a baby is no less dependent on its mother the first few years than it is when in it grew in the womb . Is the child still a parasite then ?
She should not have the baby in the first place , and thats what im saying . The only irresponsible move a 12 year old would be making is not having an abortion , as she is not physically and emotionally capable of raising or bearing a child .
So God already knows if a particular person will become an addict ? That does n't leave much free choice for that person , does it ? If I go to a restaurant and God already knows I 'm going to choose the poached salmon for my entree , then I do n't have much choice in the matter , do I ? Omniscience and free will are mutually exclusive . If God is omniscient , then we are indeed ultimately robots . Deluded with the perception of free will , but robots none the less . Unless of course , God is so omnipotent that he can know everything and still allow free choice . But then reason , logic , and thought become delusional . Sounds like a loose / loose situation to me .
So what . Congress can pass any law it wants . Does n't mean it will stand up in court . The first portion , `` A well regulated Militia , being necessary to the security of a free State , '' is a qualifier to what follows `` the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed . '' It seems pretty clear to me . But I 'm not one of the Justices . This decision has been made , although I do n't like it or agree with it . I do n't see where today 's hobbyist meets the intent - most especially in the well-regulated part . But there comes a point where what the dead guys thought just does n't matter that much . It is 200+ years later . They left us with the ability to adjust with time and we 've done that . They recognized their own shortcomings which might have the the wisest thing they did . The current interpretation is clear . We look at the last portion of the statement only . I do n't think that , as I said before , a little common sense , is going to alter the interpretation in any meaningful way . After all , I could easily argue ( if I was totally stupid ) that my front yard is the perfect place for a working cannon . We both know that is n't going to fly . Just where does the armament argument end . With a cannon ? Or with a Nuc . Let 's face it . They said arms and they meant arms . Not guns . They 'd probably let me have the cannon . The founding fathers never envisioned the kind of weapons we 'd have available today or what they 'd be used for . That 's why their thoughts are purposely criptic and open ended . Since we will always draw the line someplace , why not draw it at a good compromise between you and me .
So Starguy since you are obviously afraid of guns and wo n't go near , you do n't have to worry about any '' violent testosterone 's '' but if you want to be friendlier well you know how to do it . OUCH .
Well said . Except for a very few , all the profetallifers here refuse to discuss either . They would rather buff , bluster , and bloviate in the most general of terms .
I believe I said the military does not use sawed off shot guns , and then I said it does use other forms of shot guns . You have never did explain why you as a gun owner defends every gun control law Sarah Brady wants ! There is a name for people like you and I believe it is traitor !
so hypothetically , if there was a ghost in the machine , what type of signs or signals would have to exist to convince you that it was there ? Is it not enough that thoughts and sensations can lead to physical changes and even to turning genes On or Off ? Just to clarify though , I think the non-physical and the physical are one in the same ... .this explains the above phenomenon of thoughts and sensations corresponding to physical changes . Like this : http : //www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/0103109.html
Well , two things here 1 ) No one has ever said that Evolution asserted that we know everthing about complexity . 2 ) The discovery institue , which publishes that list , basicallyi gave a poll out , then after responses , changed the wording of it . Basically , it 's a lie .
Thanks , that 's very kind of you .
We 've already been over this and again you 're confusing two separate issues . I think everyone is agreed that people no matter what race are entitled to equal protection under the law .
And terrorists probably kill less people in the US than non terrorists . To even begin to make any kind of meaningful comparison you have to adjust for the fact that there are a lot more people who do n't pack heat than those that do in the US .
First of all , the government can not increase the volume and social acceptance of a drug - only the market and society can do that . Government can not even decrease the volume or social acceptance of drugs - despite the government 's efforts , drug use has remained relatively constant . What has n't remained constant is violent crime , which has gone up during the drug war as it did during alcohol prohibition .
What is a waste of time is the fact the most creationists do n't understand science . They listen to such people as Hovind and Ham and Baugh and believe that they are being told the truth . The fact that they do n't know what the theory of evolution is only indicates that they have n't bothered to educate themselves before expressing opinions .
No , it 's a pity that you have no consistency in either your science or your arguments . Your argument about dwarves and giants determined by a single protein works on an individual level fine but in determining a whole Race within the same genome group , not so fine .
I 'm not angry . In fact , I 'm laughing at you right now .
There 's no such thing as the `` Liberal Party '' .
But there is evidence that we do evolve . I 'll give you an example . In areas of west Africa where malaria is endemic there is an allele of hemoglobin that confers resistance when heterozygous . In other environments that allele is not beneficial and is , in fact , deleterious . It is fatal when homozygous . Now according to evolutionary theory such an allele should decline where it offers no benefit . Studies show that this allele is less frequent by about 2 percentage points in Americans of west African ancestry .
Please stop demonstrating your complete inability to understand evolutionary theory . How is Texas Stadium meaningful in the population of the earth ? Do various blimp pilots who soar over Texas Stadium have better sexual success than you ? You seem to be a bit of a sad sack .
It 's usually easier to take the immoral path . Stealing 's easier than working . Lying 's easier than telling the truth . Being a deadbeat parent is easier than being a good parent . The list goes on and on .
Yes , and since some might not , it should not be mentioned at all ? Personally I only know a half dozen people who have had abortions ( at least that I know if ) . 1 of them does n't care , she has had 6 or 8 abortions ... pretty much used them instead of the pill . 2 are pro life zealots now and feel terrible about the fact they had aboortions . 2 are pro life , but not zealots . The final one was overwhelming pro choice prior to her abortion . Attended rallies and everything . SHE felt so bad about havinghte abortion afterwards that 6 months later she blew her head off . She could not get it out of her head that she had killed a baby . She became totally obsessed and finally cracked . So , yea ... maybe it is not so out of line for people , including men , to say `` Think about it real hard because a lot of people regret it '' . You do n't have to get shot to know it hurts .
Well it came from somewhere and presumably changed as it went along .
Apologies , that was n't my intention . My meaning was this ; while it was your conclusion , your use of it as an unsupported 'fact ' forced us to treat it as an assumption . We had no way by which we could make it a conclusion - that 's the purpose of this thread !
Straw man . I am not attacking the achievements of science . I am attacking the notion that you have that scientists are exempt from the catalogue of influences that affect everyone else ; with only the slightest admission of a tiny possibility of cultural influence - which was quickly dismissed anyway with the false analogy of comparing evolution to aeronautical engineering .
You SERIOUSLY need to take a basic biology course so you can stop sticking your foot in your mouth An egg is NOT larva , and larva is NOT a caterpillar , and a caterpillar is NOT a butterfly - much the same as a zygote is NOT a embryo , and a embryo is NOT a fetus , and a fetus is NOT a baby , and a baby is NOT an adult . I challenge you to prove that a larva is exactly the same as a butterfly . If you ca n't even do something as simple as that , then you 'll never understand the process/transformation of what a human has to go through , and THAT in and of itself should give you a clue as to how much in denial you are in , and how much you have to twist the truth around just to justify your version of events . Deal with it !
Know of them , no , since I have n't studied any of it , however , typing in `` cave drawing '' at wikipedia brought this up , I suggest you take a look . Cave painting
Uhhh ... yeah there is .
Hmmm ... He may get things right only when he thinks getting it right contradicts evolution ...

Oh really the people who where behind the petition drive here in michigan want to deny me marriage , Here I will let the head of the organization that spearheaded the drive explain it in her own words . http : //www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp ? ID=19408
Well the government track record in health care is n't too good . Medicare is broke and busted by their own accounts . So if they ca n't run that correctly by what stretch of the imagination do you come up with them being able to manage the whole healthcare industry ? Medicaid is broke . The VA healthcare system is a shambles . You would think they would get them up and running smoothly before trying to sell us the snake oil of their healthcare . Then there is the big problem of rationing . No matter what lies are told , health care is rationed in socialized medicine .
And I propose we put lunatics who make threats to completely legitimate doctors in a state mental ward for a few years to straighten them out . As to the abortion issue , are the pro lifers really that willing to risk one of their precious fetuses over a traffic ticket ? !
And why are you letting them define what the theory is ? Especially when it is wrong . Of course , I am arguing that having fewer assumptions has nothing to do with being right .
Why conception ? When a mature ovum leaves the ovary , it has every potential of turning into a human being . How dare I stand idly by while that potential life is wasted , unfertilized ? No ; clearly , it is my duty to try to reach that ovum with my seed . God said to be fruitful and multiply , so I am just following God 's will .
Because I think you misinterpreted his point . See below :
the bad thing about pregnancy is that it brings a life into the world . the most common reason for abortion is that the woman does not want the child . abortions that occur due to complications or medical risks to the mother or child make up less than 5 % of the total .
I assume nothing of the sort . That statement only relies on that fact that if same-sex couples were allowed to marry , the marriage rights of opposite-sex couples would be unaffected and would remain completely intact .
You could n't make an association like this to save your life . Hitler gained power by deception much like what is happening now . The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising ( google it ) puts to rest any claim you have made about Hitler . He did disarm Jews , Gypsies and others he was afraid of because they did not support him . He also had some weird features you share like torturing and burning helpless creatures ! People can not be tyrannical by definition . Check it out ! Your claim is dismissed for want of cause and no true stated claim .
Question is what sort of punishment would you have for adultery if there was an amendment ? Financial , already their in divorce . Are you going to lock adulterer up ?
I 'm sure you 're very well aware that evolution does not and can not work like that . There was never any necessity that membrane proteins like proteorhodopsin in bacteria would one day evolve into the rhodopsin we use to see with : it was of benefit to the bacteria , and that 's enough for natural selection .
In an attempt to educate : Not at all , my dear Bushy . It is because smart people these days are clever enough not to lock themselves into claiming something which will later be proven to be false . They give us guidelines and theories , which by their definition can be changed to suit the facts we have to hand . Benjamin : If Mizzmaxx 's points are so easily refuted , then please , be my guest and refute them .
But growth is fairly irrelevant . My sperm can grow into a human too , and have mental existence , yet ejaculating is n't murder . It just becomes a huge debate on where to draw the line , therefore it is best to focus on the state that it is right NOW . Not what it was or could possibly be . That seems reasonable to me . [ /quote ]
It is n't possible to tell . What is called the `` scientific '' approach is to analyse social statistics to derive probabilities , a methodology which assumes that the present is the same as the past , all well and good for the physical sciences , where the way particles behave does not change , but inappropriate in application to complex systems like people , that may react in ways totally unanticipated . Not only is unpredictability inherent in such systems , but the more ways you try to manipulate them , the more uncertain the reaction to any particular intervention becomes . So what do you do then , just take this method anyway , even given you ca n't predict the results , just take your best shot ? When it fails , just say `` oops , well , we had good intentions , we ca n't be blamed '' . If that 's all we have to work with , we are truly screwed . There are however , alternative ways of deciding whether you should do something to trying to predict its outcome .
What 's your point ? One is never born a Christian no matter what the circumstance .
And why is that ? Because the framers of our constitution felt that all white men were equal , the rest were property . It is this kind of ignorant and narrow minded thought that will have people rubbing their heads in 200 years , wondering why gays were ever treated as second class citizens who did not deserve the same rights given to straights .
Sounds like a good plan to me ...
Well , we really do n't know . However we do know that the woman has self conscious , and feels pain . Something the fetus lacks . She also can interact with other human beings , and develop relationships and attachments . Another thing the fetus lacks . Phisically , she is larger and much more capable than the fetus , and has a formed brain . Another thing the fetus lacks . In conclusion , we really do n't know . But , we do know that the woman can do , feel , and become more than a fetus is .
It varies . Sometimes elementary/middle school kids and sometimes older minors like high school kids . I not talking about gangbangers if this is where you 're going .
I counted the cases listed , not the body counts of each case .
Maybe He does n't punish them .
You do n't believe in inherited traits ?
I did n't know this had already been posted . Like I said I do n't really follow the gun thread that often .
And if they 're stolen that means that they 're illegally possessed by a currently illegal supplier . And since they 're illegally possessed by an illegal supplier , that means that they 're obviously not bothered by the current laws cocnerning firearms possession by criminals , meaning that banning gun ownership wo n't even make them blink .
From your own link it is very clear the NRA DID NOT say that or publish that . Your clearly very wrong .
Right . That is the white morph in winter fur . Here it is in summer fur . And here is the blue morph in summer fur and winter fur . The fact is that some arctic foxes never are pure white . And it does n't take a matter of months for them to change from dark to light . I spent a year where I saw lots of these animals every day . Remind me to tell you about Archie , who lived under the C Battery mess hall . But that 's not really the point . Your clumsy bait and switch was beginning a discussion about evolution and then trying to represent the seasonal change in color of foxes as evolution . The ability of the foxes to change may be evolution but the fact that they do change every year and then back again is n't .
That has nothing whatsoever to do with my post that you replied to . I was agreeing with a post by Flygirl which pointed out that the hospital displayed a basic lack of common decency , which I trust you also agree with . Gay marriage or not , the hospital could have and should have allowed visitation . After all , some hospitals do -- they are each a business and can do as they choose . There is a lot of activism going on in terms of getting hospitals to do this . See Gay rights groups launch hospital rating system , and the report itself .
Some important concepts ( and why the word no longer has meaning in biology ) is the concept of an intrinsic need to improve . Such concepts were discredited with Darwin . As is pointed out , opponents of evolution use the word in a disparaging way in order to reduce science to religion on a level with `` creationism '' . While `` creationism '' is a belief in mythology based on no evidence , no one `` believes '' in evolution . Evolution consists of observations that are explained by the theories of evolution .
Re : Are we to fill the prisons ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Quote : Originally Posted by Gilluin If abortion is made illegal I predict that you will see across the border abortion clinics , in canada and states that still premit abortion . Are we to fill the prisons with those seeking abortions in places where it is legal if they live in states that do not allow abortions ? Prolifers better becare for what they wish for . Prolifers tend to be conservative and do not like taxes . They better get ready to pay , in taxes , for the extra prisons and social programs needed for all those abandoned children . I would gladly double my taxes to help save the weak and the unborn . Better idea though instead of locking up the women/men seeking termination and euthanasia why not lock up the obs/gyno/ and doctors that carry out theses procedures ? Pro life is NOT just about termination of pregnancies .
That is a truism . Who says that scientific materialism need be the only measure of scientific truth ?
Just wondering if you are going to respond to the OP ( as it was addressed to you to help you to understand something ) . If you ask me I 'd just ignore the negative comments that some posters make toward you . Just focus onexplanations of misunderstandings and constructive criticism .
And yet the post-Dunblane handgun ban happened after only one event .
I 'm not arguing that gun control will change the nature of men- though guns may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime . With guns criminals can do even more damage . Adding guns to crime is like adding gasoline to a fire- it makes an already existing problem worse . If you think that just as many people die from stabbing and beatings in other developed nations as people die from guns in the US then you need to do more research .
You 're babbling .
Jesus ! Another scientific illiterate . The facts are the observations . And the point is not to test facts but to explain them with an hypothesis that suggests a prediction as a consequence that can be tested by experimentation .
There are no objective reasons to condemn gays . Marriage is not a matter of state and so it is meaningless to argue whether a state should recognize it . My advocating of perfect liberty allows no contradictions or exceptions , believe me I have lost alot of support from conservatives for this , perhaps even gays if one really applied it to all extremes .
I think maybe you have hit yourself in the head with the Bible a few times too often .
Yes , and it reduces a much needed population growth too .
And it does n't stop there . Another of my favorites is how they loudly criticize radiometric dating ( most commonly radiocarbon dating because they know no other kind ) then shout from the rooftops that radiometric dating confirms the `` genuineness '' of ~2000 year old manuscripts ...
I 've heard this type of statment before and it does n't seem to hold water . Opposing abortion is not a political view , its a moral view and children are subject to their parents moral views from day one until they are adults . Its called parenting .
Could happen .
marc says some pretty ridiculous things on a regular basis here , but this one 's got ta be in the top ten . To think that there were no arguments for atheism or against theism before Darwin is the height if philosophical ignorance . After all , when I tried to engage marc in a discussion totally independent of evolution -- morality -- he ran .
Oh you little tramp !
But what he is doing is taking evolution ( considered a `` fact '' ) adding it to a theory ( there is no god ) and trying to convice his reader that he has added ; fact + theory = fact . Evolution seems to do that in it 's subcatagories . How do we distinguish the difference between the validity of when it 's done in a subcatagory vs when it 's done concerning the general term ? Do you get equally irritatied by the little captions under the names of Kent Hovind , or Michael Behe , or Ben Stein , or William Dembski ? Why the double standard ? Why not let them be individuals also ? Why not let them come to certain conclusions without attacking captions , or ideologies ? Why the fear in letting future generations be exposed to their path of thinking ?
Yes it is patent that you would assume that . Your wish to advertise this and tell the world , repeatedly must make you of some import . Repeatedly you make this a personal issue . I have addressed posts and say 'another poster has said ... such and such ' . But you insist that I address YOU in such posts . Now you are going at it again , saying I 'm not answering questions . This is an attempt to take the moral high-ground , and is itself highly deceitful , especially in light that you have in the past accused me of saying things that I did n't ... see our discussions re : Archie , the transitional bird-beast . Also , you name-call , and then chuck a tantrum if anyone does the same back . I must say here that I do wish you 'd stop personalising this , as it only leads to more confrontation , not discussion . Calling people names is just grand-standing . It is the sort of behaviour that suggests someone who is just interested in making themselves heard , regardless of anyone else .
Well gon na sign up now and beat the rush ? Ah the other I 'm not familar with . McKelvey 's site ?
So you 're going to live with the Amish eh ?
Well then , my skeptic fellow Australians , what is the answer to the question ? Do any of you guys here know ? I sure as hell do n't . Creationists did not misquote Dawkins because the words came from his mouth . And Dawkins is a professional at biology , but he could not answer such a question . In the little amount of fossils that we do see , they are not evolutionary . There is no clear cut fossils showing the evolution of man , is there . By `` true human '' I mean they were just like us , just varients of human kind that we have today - looked human , walked like us , most likely were quite intelligent . I have got to go to school , continue this later .
And you 've been failing miserably , partly because your definition of `` atheism '' is asinine . Even most Christians would disagree with you .
This stat sounds more than a bit inflated . Seeing as it comes from a website called `` women 's issues '' it is probably not all that credible .
I have no idea what this could possibly mean . It makes no sense , semantically or logically . It is so vague as a concept as to be worthless in terms of the pursuit of knowledge .
Again , you are mistaken . ALL of these groups compete for multiple things , and I 'll give you real , concrete examples you might even be able to find watching Animal Planet . 1 . ) Animals compete for mates ALL THE TIME . Have you never seen male lions fighting each other , or elk , hyenas , etc , etc ? They fight , the stronger one wins , and the female selects the victor to be her mate , and they produce offspring that likely would grow up to be stronger than those produced by the other male . 2 . ) Animals compete for resources ALL THE TIME . Nature moves in cycles . Regions experience dry periods , wet periods , cold periods , hot periods , etc . Therefore , viable sources for food fluctuate from season to season . At one point , for example , there may be more predators than prey . With not enough food to go around for entire populations of predators , only those with the ability to go long periods of time without food , or can more effectively find food before other individuals in the population , will survive and those that can not will likely die . When you get into animals that live in groups ( packs , herds , etc . ) you will find that competition occurs between these groups . ( I am reminded of a famous scene from 2001 : A Space Odyssey ) That 's really all I have to offer to this debate , hopefully somebody will help verify/strengthen my points , seeing as I 'm hardly the expert . supersport , I have been watching your posting strategy , and frankly you seem to be shooting yourself in the foot ; most of the things you claim as `` facts '' are downright false . I genuinely want to hear where you get such claims , but I fear you 'll just ignore me like you ignore everybody else who makes a point . Please , address my points . If not , you can expect a PM from me . I just want to know where you get this stuff .
Gun Control is not on this list of crime contributing factors . However banning guns would leave the law-abiding defenseless in the face of these criminal predators . Why do n't you work for changing these conditions instead of working for something that has no effect on reducing crime ( gun control ) . However , if you think you can prove gun control will work as crime control , then go for it ! Maybe you can cower us with your overwhelming evidence .
No , of course not . Instead , you call us `` liberals '' and then call liberals racist .
Not if you have permission to do one from the buyer . If I sold a firearm , and did n't know the person so well , I would do one . I have contacts in businesses who can do them for me for free . Its just a smart thing to do . Should it be the law ? No way . But I would do it . Better safe than sorry in this instance .
Because there IS no evidence against creationism .
Well you seemed to jump to a conclusion about who God was , not what he really is !
No I do not say that the creation of energy and matter did not coincide the creation of the laws that govern/regulate them . What I say is that the laws are not the RESULTS of the existence of energy , matter etc .
There are many people who may be involved and impacted by pregnancy - but only one person is actually physically pregnant .
I say that you need to take into consideration the number of criminals that 'll disregard the lock and try and break down the door anyway . That 's why smart people do n't rely exclusively on locks and security systems for their own protection .
And it is n't the job of the school to teach anyone about your god . That is the job of the parents . If it is a good idea to teach about your god in the public school , it is also a good idea to teach about mine . How about Wicca and Islam . A good idea , right ? But if some creationists do n't like their children learning science , then they should put them in their own `` christian '' schools where they can become scientific illiterates who think that heliocentrism is a fact .
I believe that this is what they call 'sarcasm ' . As for the second part of your comment , why am I not surprised ?
what is your basis for this ? You said :
According to guncite.com only 14 % of homes in Switzerland have a fully automatic weapon in them . http : //guncite.com/swissgun.html
and repeated by star gazer , what is wrong with this statement that makes it such an atrocious lie ? ergo : The NRA promotes a lethaL product History , the NRA was and is the leading trainer for Law Enforcement . Are law enforcement a lethal product ? The NRA was a developement of Congress desires that a Civilian Marksmanship Program be established to train future soldiers competent gun skills and marksmanship . Is the military a lethal product ? ergo : Guns kill alot more people than the KKK does Sensless comparison and propaganda to infer that anyone who owns guns kill more people than the KKK by comparing and equating guns to the KKK and infer that the NRA is specifically targeting black folks . The truth is that the MMM and brady campaign has used guns to kill more people than the modern KKK . This is a specious and invalid statement with a false delimma as well as an ignorant comparison of two dissimular objects ; one is an inatimate object and the other is a racist organization . Did n't you ever listen to Big Bird and learn `` one of these things is not like the other ? '' ergo : so the NRA is alot worse and its an insult to the KKK to be compared to them . brady loss of mental faculties . The propaganda begs the reader to assume that the NRA teaches white people to kill black folks and is worse than the KKK and that the NRA is therefore worse than a racist organization . He should be sued for slander and you for repeating the propaganda and illogical slur to promote this ignorant and false display of word association . No proof exists but the statement is displayed as an absolute truth . Neither brady nor you can stand on any word comparison made here as the truth much less explain the slur or prove any validity what-so-ever . Not yet satisfied , you go on :
So all the creatures you see today came about suddenly and fully formed ? And you observed this ? If this happened , the only one who couldobserve it is God .
You crack me up .
So is Jesus , aka God , a liar ? Or was not even one of the millions of believers who prayed for Terri Schiavo 's life to be saved really God 's child ? Gee , I wonder how many people out there are being led by a pastor , priest , or what have you , that prayed but God did n't listen because that religious leader is a fraud ? Hmmm , maybe the rape or molestation of young boys , adulty , and so on , by religious leaders is more widespread than anyone could have imagined ? ! ? ! ? !
Mr. Justice Harlan once wrote : `` [ T ] he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause can not be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution . This `liberty ' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property ; the freedom of speech , press , and religion ; the right to keep and bear arms ; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures ; and so on . It is a rational continuum which , broadly speaking , includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints . . . and which also recognizes , what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must , that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment . '' Justice Potter Stewart , a judge on the Roe v Wade case said in his concurring opinon : `` Several decisions of this Court make clear that freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . . . . As recently as last Term , in Eisenstadt v. Baird , 405 U. S. 438 , 453 , we recognized `` the right of the individual , married or single , to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child . '' `` That right necessarily includes the right of a woman to decide whether or not to terminate her pregnancy .
Yes , it is very hard , even for theologians , to explain .
After reading that I had to go talk to Ralph on the big white telephone .
So when your God killed all of the helpless , little first borns in Egypt he too was another baby-killing liberal ? You are very amusing and naive .
I 've seen people ( on TV ) who would actually know about such things say that the fact that these things passed in these states pretty much spels doom for any possible constitutional ammendment . Do n't ask me how they figure this . It 's just what they were saying .
Ok , so you are admitting that the unborn fetus , is in fact , a child ? I have to believe that is what you mean from your statement above . That being the case , do you condone the killing of a child that is born but will likely live in poverty the rest of his or her life ? Do you condone the killing of a handicapped child that is born ? If not , then you ca n't condone abortion . Also , who gives you the right to decide what is best for a child by killing him or her ? That should not be your choice ( this is another problem with humanism , because there is no moral authority to stop people from doing whatever they want to do , hence the adage that humanism is a philosophy that has both feet planted firmly in mid-air ) . I am sure the child would n't agree to that choice if given a voice to do so . Let 's go ahead and do it your way by taking religion out of law . Is murder still illegal in your humanistic world ? Likely it is still illegal because even humanists realize that anarchy is not suitable for society . Then why is this not murder ? Look back to effects this has on women . That is also bad for society . And that affects us all .
Well , one ca n't be truly logical and not be an atheist ( or at least agnostic . ) As any religion simply flys in the face of logic . Faith and logic are poles apart . Keep truckin ' Jim ! Happy weekend to you bro .
They 'll also ignore these other historical records of the flood Randy . Because they must in order to hold on to their secular belief system . Abiogenesis and the Origin of Life
There is a pretty huge difference . Civil unions are n't nationally recognized , for one thing , since not every state has them . If you travel to a state that does not offer civil unions , then your union is not valid there . I think there 's a problem with dissolving those unions as well . The big difference , though , are the rights that these unions provide . There are over 1,000 legal protections and rights that marriage provides that civil unions do n't . I 'll try and find a list of differences .
In the examples you gave , the doctor is clearly trying his* very best to save the most lives he can . What if the Siamese twins were in no mortal danger while together ? And what if one Siamese twin has legs but the other does n't ? Is n't the other twin dependent on the one with legs ? Could a doctor ethically remove the legless twin if the legged twin wanted to and if the legless twin was retarded and the procedure would leave the legless twin dead ? * ( or her best.. I 'm sorry but my doctor is male , so I will no longer use `` his/her '' or `` he/she '' ... it just gets tiring after a while ... )
One has to wonder why gun haters always ask this quesion . Has this question ever been asked of people that read books ? It is interesting how people that want to ban the right to bear arms never apply their logic to the rights they like . The gun haters clearly like the 1st amend . The gun haters use their 1st amend right to attack the right to bear arms . When racist use their 1st amend right to attack other peoples right it is called hate speech . So why is it that gun haters demanding the banning of the right to bear arms is not considered hate speech ? After all gun haters are just like the other hate groups . All they do is attack the right to bear arms . Not once has a gun hater ever demand that dangerous criminals be punished .
Since animals can operate them , gun owners obviously need sufficient training to make sure they are used safely . It seems they need a lot more . On the other hand , the problem is largely self-limiting , since the cretinous owner either dies or hopefully learns from their stupidity once they recover from their injuries .
I know ... I know . I agree with you that it 's sad more of those people could n't or did n't take advantage of concealed carry to help prevent so many deaths . That needs to change along with education so more people can defend themselves .
I believe he refers to the fact that the morning after pill will keep a fertilized egg , if there is a fertilized egg , from implanting ( which 60 % do n't on their own anyway but.. ) . To the delusional , that 's an abortion . Besides , the restriction is that no military funding , or health facilities can be used to perform an abortion . A pharmacy is a STORE .
Good idea !
His point also addresses the intentional overpopulation for the purpose of overwhelming declining populations by Islam .
One should n't assume ignorance on the part of creationists . That is a mistake that too many evolutionists make . In the real world , we have people willing to say things they already know is n't true . Why should creationists be any different ? After all , they are people , too . But rather than accept that fact , evolutionists argue that creationists are ignorant of a subject when , in reality , they ( creationists ) were simply telling lies .
HELLO ! ! THAT 'S WHY ! ! Then we see the standard dance of how innocent and objective science really is . 6 ) And the standard `` theistic evolution '' dance . Atheistic evolutionists ca n't get along without it ! I wonder if Kenneth Miller will see the movie , and comment on it . I wonder if he 'd have refused to be a part of it .
So you are saying the US system is better ?
Now you 're playing word games to confuse people . Page 11 of the Heller ruling stated that the definition of `` arms '' include all modern forms of bearable arms that 're in common use . They did n't rule on machineguns because they were n't part of the case .
You are right unless some people find their backbones , and since it doesnt look like thats going to happen I guess the rest of us better grow an extra one .
So what else is new ? Does Texas support the death penalty ?
Would that work like the ban on illegal drugs in American ? Does that ban keep illegal drugs out of American ? The ban on illegal drugs does one thing , it does keep illegal drugs from law-abiding citizens . Law-abiding citizens are the only ones that respect the law when it comes to bans .
Your statement is a logical fallacy . It is not proof but simply illogical . The fallacy is called the fallacy of inconsistency . You argue from two contradictory premises . 1 ) God is all Powerful , 2 ) God can not do something . You state one as the conclusion of the other but that is just a funny way of stating two premises . The statement is illogical . Look up your favorite text on logical fallacies and you will see that I am right .
Sure you do . Because like any reprobate , what is wrong , is right to you ; and what is right , is wrong to you . So of course you consider anything i believe to be wrong . But just so my original statement is n't lost to your attack , here it is again so it can be clearly interpreted without your tainted condemnation . Archangel The ugly reality of life in America today regarding the secular humanist Left is that they support free speech as long as you agree with them . If you disagree with them , you are branded as a religious zealot who 's determined to take their rights away . What they do n't want you to ever realize is that it is they who are tearing at the traditions and customs that America was built upon and gained us the respect of the World at large . And it is their corruption of the morals and values America once represented that is the cause of so much hatred and disrespect from the rest of the World today . So thanks to the liberal immoral left , we are seen as the moral evil of the World . Not because of the Religious Right as the Left would have you believe .
you 're looking at evolution in way too much of a magical and mystical way . Evolution does n't `` know '' anything . It does n't have any desires ... and ... i lack the eloquence to briefly state mechanical ( and complete lack of desire ) aspects of evolution . i suggest you do research as to how there are no conscious thinking elements in evolution . Science will never be able to disprove any god because of some flaw science happens to point out . The best individuals can do is , when people try to reason that such perfect organs imply a designer , point out that the design is n't all that perfect after all . If you want to try and debate flaws in design are evidence against a god ... well go ahead ... but then i 'll just know if i 'm ever looking for an easy debate victory i 'll just try to find you . At the very best all you are doing is showing that the idea that God created all things perfectly probably is n't true ... and even then someone can just point out that apparent flaws we see are simply the ineffable will of god .
And I the opposite ... Kind of a wash I guess .
Invalid argument to assert that mutations can map a road outside of their assigned task in illogical , where would the information to do so come from ? Biology works because every individual cell doing what it was created to do along with what the one next to it was , though created to perform another set of instructions creates the molecular change that the combination of the cells together would produce . But there is no additional information there ... not int he way you assert .
Millions of people died before guns came into existence . Hundreds of thousands per day , per incident . Prove otherwise .
That sentence does n't even make sense . Did it occur to you that you should actually think about what you are going to say and express actual ideas ?
And , of course , you totally miss the point . The point is that a 1-day-old infant can be cared for by ANYBODY ! It is no longer dependent upon the body and resources of only one person . But , of course , if that one person is only a lowly , less than human woman , that lowly person has absolutely no rights to compare with that of the almighty , holy fetus .
I think you and my ten year old could really connect . Happy Easter , Jim . You really are one of my favorite conservatives .
That 's a nice silver-lining take on the situation , but you and I both know that there are times someone who has a greater and more pressing need for the job ( even to feed his family ) gets put aside for someone who does n't need it as badly . The issue here is n't `` fairness . '' This issue is doing unto others as you 'd have them do unto you . If you 're going to hold the golden rule up as a rule , you have to be consistent .
Oh , you have a problem with Socialism ? Is that so ?
To be fair , that was always a poorly-framed and badly-lit pop-media snapshot of scientific thinking , and was propagated far more often in recent times by the opponents of evolution , such as yourself , than by any actual scientist .
Actually NDS does not have to imagine the mechanism involved they actually know the mechanism . By the fact of their being alive ( which is in fact the `` life-struggle '' ) they acquire ( as a population ) mutations . Some of those mutations aid them in their `` life-struggle '' and thus become more likely to appear in the succeeding generation . Thus the succeeding generations have a slightly different memory of the past than their predecessors . And thats that ; the author clearly does not grasp the means by which complexity emerges in biological systems . Once more Adami is applicable here . And I have to add that the mechanisms of mutation , selection , and inheritance are well established at the molecular level , at the micro-cytological level , at the nuclear level , at the cellular level , at the organisimal level , and at the population and ecological levels . EAMs only riposte to that large empirical base is - to invoke mysterious and unknown and undemonstrated mechanisms which have no basis in fact . Sorry but the EAM hypothesis does not fly any better than a solid lead balloon .
You mean like the constitution ? Like renaming all of the rights and protections some get others do not . Like redefining all of the benefits that this staple of american society so depends on ? Like ... I would ... saaay the 14th ammendment perhaps to only inlcude some people and not others and ignore the fact it is the baisis of our socierty here in the USA ?
So , we agree again . This is the second time you have labeled one of my points meaningless . I do not disagree . In and of themselves , they are meaningless . Any meaning is assigned to them by whoever wishes to interpret them .
Fish to Amphibian supporting evidence frmo here : Fish/Amphibian Transition from primitive bony fish to amphibians : Paleoniscoids again ( e.g . Cheirolepis ) Osteolepis -- one of the earliest crossopterygian lobe-finned fishes , still sharing some characters with the lungfish ( the other group of lobe-finned fish ) . Had paired fins with a leg-like arrangement of bones , and had an early-amphibian-like skull and teeth . Eusthenopteron ( and other rhipidistian crossopterygian fish ) -- intermediate between early crossopterygian fish and the earliest amphibians . Skull very amphibian-like . Strong amphibian-like backbone . Fins very like early amphibian feet . Icthyostegids ( such as Icthyostega and Icthyostegopsis ) -- Terrestrial amphibians with many of Eusthenopteron 's fish features ( e.g. , the fin rays of the tail were retained ) . Some debate about whether Icthyostega should be considered a fish or an amphibian ; it is an excellent transitional fossil . Labyrinthodonts ( e.g. , Pholidogaster , Pteroplax ) -- still have some icthyostegid features , but have lost many of the fish features ( e.g. , the fin rays are gone , vertebrae are stronger and interlocking , the nasal passage for air intake is well defined . ) And while nothing is ever proven 100 % in science , the link between fish and amphibians is pretty conclusive . Evidence for dino to bird evolution just keeps mounting and at present it is the best supported theory . Just look at the recent discovery of an oviraptorosaurian dinosaur with 2 eggs still in it 's body , two very bird like eggs ... ..See here : dinoeggs So once again , while not proven 100 % , dino to bird evolution is the best supported theory . Do you have anything that is better supported ? ? ?
Actually , if you know what you are talking about even a quick glance will tell you that you are wrong . Of course , paleoanthropologists who study such fossils do more than take a quick glance at it .
Not in this instance , no . It isnt trying to parallel pregnancy per se ( though it is most relevant for us if we take it as only 9 months ) , but trying to parallel the moral scenario of having a person attached to you against your will and without your consent . If the pro-life mantra is to be believed , it is never correct to disconnect someone if they will die if you do . So , the argument is applicable for 9 days , 9 months , 9 years or forever .
Mehhh ... . You probably went to a Catholic school . But now that you 've stopped 'devoting ' your 'life ' to the God of the Bible , you 've 'devoted ' yourself to another god , Yourself . Typical case .
So do electrons fired through the diffractive equivalent of a double slit . Individual unpredictability does not imply free will .
Again , perspective .
Perfect . A creationists caught repeating the same refuted arguments on different forums . Resistance is met , run like a coward to another forum .
Actually , I do n't have any respect for creationism in most of it 's varied forms . I have had great respect for several individual creationists that I have met . But they earned that respect .
I agree . What is the point ? Felons with firearms do not bother with CCW licenses .
Why should n't Revelation be taken literally ?
I believe I said I would change my view . I will change my view on the issue of whether homosexuality is genetic .
What a laugh ! ! ! From what I 've heard , Supersort here went running with his tail behind his legs ( or maybe it was that he was banned , I forget - that might have been one of the other boards ) . The thread over there is a compilation of the over half-dozen debate boards SS has been preaching his ignorance on , usually reusing his arguments on each board and then leaving once they get disproved and torn apart to go on to another board and preach some more of the same exact ignorance . It really is very sad .
You 're still missing the point : There is no rational reason for enacting legislation barring gays from getting married .
So how can evilutionists have any confidence in carbon dating if they keep updating the calibration curve ? Huh ?
Strawman . Evolution is a process , it 's not `` creating '' anything . Fallacy : The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed . It 's the conservation of energy . It has nothing to do with the reorganization of matter and/or energy into other forms . Whatsoever . No fallacy here on their side , but you 're doing pretty good for your first point on your side .
Clearly this is true . There are a multitude of denominations from every religion . This is as specially true with Christianity because the texts do not explain how all the ceremonies are done . Baptism was performed in areas where full immersion could not have occurred but the best explanations of baptism paint a picture of a full immersion . The Church of Christ believes one must baptize in the name of Jesus , the Father , Son and Holy Ghost thing was while Jesus lived . Because the practice of speaking in tongues was used by the first church , some believe the art must stay in the church . Most of the complications to Christianity is simply because the followers really believed Jesus would return . No one wrote a book on the Religion . The Religion changed a great deal through time . King James was no saint and he had clear reasons he would not allow some letters into an authorized version he would sign on to . One letter spoke of the sin of Slavery . This was clearly at odds with King James . Other items would have direct negative effects on the kingdom and I 'll let others find the reasoning behind the withdraws .
What ? You do n't know what you 're talking about . But , generally pot smokers will hang out with other pot smokers to smoke pot . That does n't mean they strictly hang out with them . I smoke it and have plenty of friends and acquaintances that do n't .
So what ? A person has a right to defend themselves , as spelled out in the Constitution . Or would you rather the 80 year old just get beaten to death for his $ 262 ? Or maybe you 'd feel better if he 'd suffered the same fate as the home invader over in Maryland . He made the mistake of breaking and entering into a student house and was slaughtered with a sword . And what point are you trying to make anyway ? It 's not like the 80 year old went on a killing spree of anything . Nobody got murdered . So what 're you moaning about ?
Actually , this ( if what that article is true , which I am not quite sure ) is a healthy part of science . Old theories are disgarded and new ones come in as more evidence is brought to bare . Every theory made by fallible man is prone to being disproven and destroyed . Man 's theories change everyday , while God 's word has remained the same .
Since evolution is a non-theistic theory ( it does not consider if there is a god or not ) , you will have to look at some like http : //www.theistic-evolution.com/ I would also look up Kenneth MIller on the web ... a highly Christian biologist who defends evolution .
So , how many kids do you have ? And , do you know their names ? What they like to do ? It does n't sound like you 've been much of a dad if all you did is providing for them . Did you watch TV sports the rest of the time ?
When the needs of the two are in conflict this is unavoidable .
Well he has further political aspirations ... ... ... .The 9th circuit in Sodom ( SF ) is always making law instead of interpreting it ... ... ..That is why they are over ruled so often ... ... .
Although i personally oppose abortion , i agree that two wrongs dont make it right .
But why does this generation get to bypass the same authority that every other generation before them submitted to with their parental oversight ? How is it right now for 13,14 and 15 year old kids to make such adult decisions without their parents knowing ? Are you suggesting that 13 year old girls are mature enough emotionally to make such adult decisions about getting an abortion ? And if so , do you then also believe that a 13-15 year olds should be allowed to adopt a child ? Or to enter into a contract to purchase a home or car ? Because those are also adult decisions and it does n't seem reasonable to me that we should allow them to slide on emotionally damaging decisions about sex or abortions and then insist they 're not mature enough to participate in other adult decisions . Kids need consistency in order to grow up to be responsible adults and by your way of thinking , you will just add more confusion and insecurity in an already difficult time in an adolescents life .
I think you 're mixing up socialist and fascist . Patriotism is anathema to socialism .
If you are open minded enough to consider an opposing point of view , Maybe one day you and I can debate those claims . But if you are a typical drive by post and run away `` choicer ? '' I would n't be interested . I digress ! The purpose of this thread ( as I understand it ) was for people to introduce themselves and say a little about their position . The purpose of this thread was not to debate our differences . I 'll not respond to any more `` baiting '' of that sort in this thread . If you have questions about the details of my views , I will gladly answer those . As I may have some questions about yours .
Well said .
Try the ( Law of Common Sense ) . If your an ex-atheist , you already know the ( Law of Relativity ) .
His science ? And I just thought it was science , no matter who did it . So , if he has his science , why ca n't I have my own science ? By the way , please tell us about your science , i.e. , your education in science . Where did you earn your degrees that give you the expertise to judge science . I am a biologist and have degrees from Montana State University , the University of Montana , and El Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey .
I 've seen no solid evidence to prove there 's an actual connection between guns and testosterone levels . Just more of your correlation/causation bull**** . One could easily argue that those with naturally higher than average testosterone levels would want to hold a gun more than they would a stupid child 's toy . Millions of people are carrying guns every day , and they 're not having hostile encounters with other people . Not even in high stress situations . That kind of blows your `` study '' out of the water . Try again .
Sounds plausible . Surely the shoe started simple and became more complex . And surely shoes provide an advantage for survival .
Well , it is being challenged in the courts , so the only way to overturn it would be to deem it no longer constitutional . Oh , and thank you !
This seems to conflict with some of your earlier posts wherein you support terrorists .
Of course they do n't care . Being selfish is a cornerstone of who they are . They think that all women are invisible
Can you explain spiritual beings ? I honestly do n't know what that means .
Rather unsurprisingly , the U.S. constitution does not have any bearing on Australian law .
No nation is perfect , Rev . Not even the USA ! A singular instance that you quote is not an argument as anyone can just as easily find criticism with the USA over people freed early from jail . You will find black people over-represented in the jails of the UK , the USA and Australia . There is injustice everywhere .
He was using it as an example . He was saying that if something in your life causes you to sin , get rid of it ! BTW , thanx for giving me the references to your verses ! It is really annoying to have to search through the Bible to find verses that people quote without references .
Except that it does nothing of the sort ... But then , what can we expect from somebody citing a website trying to sell you liquid vitamin supplement ... Nevertheless , we look into the Pottenger 's cats claim . Here is a page called , `` Lesson of the Pottenger 's Cats Experiment : cats are not humans . '' Although it 's a page aimed at explaining why this `` experiment '' is not applicable to humans , it exposes the other , erm , flaws in this experiment . The one striking me based on the wikipedia list of diets for the groups should be obvious to everyone : many of these cats were being deprived of protein . This page confirms and elaborates . In fact , its first point is that today 's cats have no problem reproducing for several generations on today 's cooked food . The difference is that good owners do n't feed their pets deficient diets . The real irony here is that this experiment -- were it reliable -- would be the antithesis of supersport 's Lamarckism . In order for supersport to be supported , the cats being fed inadequate diets would re-develop those broken pathways for manufacturing essential amino acids . Obviously , they did not . The only thing we see here is the effect of poor ( i.e . positively malnutritive ) diet . We can conclude that supersport 's Morton 's demon is pretty much in full control . There 's no other explanation for somebody seeing this experiment and thinking it supports Lamarckism , or even counters evolutionary theory , even if he does n't know the basics of experimentation and nutrition .
No , but the Roman persecution of Christians , covering Christians in pitch , Roman garden parties , witnesses for Christ being killed for their faith etc . is as irrelevant as it gets . Just be careful , that 's all I 'm saying . There is a place for that topic .
Argh . Atheism is no belief in a god , `` without belief in god '' . Why would you try to prove a negative ? Did you wake up today and believe in a UNI because you could n't prove it did n't exist ? Richbee has a long way to go to `` prove '' anything other than his fondness for rhetoric . -Mach
Wouldnt it be wonderful if , in this male-centered world , drugs were designed to be women-friendly , especially pregnant women-friendly ?
Actually you are incorrect . The most commonly used rifles on the competition circuit are so-called `` assault weapons '' . The `` assault weapon '' moniker is a term just recently fashioned to describe a military looking weapon . There are several target competitions designed solely for these types of rifles .
Yes , I believe there will be a lot more to come ( as you said , just look at the `` hobbits '' that were recently discovered ) . I love this sort of look into the migrations of everyone over the last 160,000 years or so .
On Faith : Murder is Murder and Abortion is Not - Arthur Waskow
Then why do you keep hyperventilating about the so called `` terrorist loophole '' ? No such standard exists , so you 've got nothing .
And I have left them feedback to see what happens . I noticed this particular entry was sourced from The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language , Fourth Edition so it is not something Dictionary.com wrote . I can see Iuris ' point but the entry is still laid out wrong if this is the case . As written , `` Godlessness ; immorality '' , implies that immorality is synonymous with godlessness but the thesaurus entry for godlessness does not list immorality as a synonym . I think this is because some use the term `` godless '' , an adjective , to mean immoral but `` godlessness '' , a noun , to mean atheistic .
But it , along with the uranian tapeworm hypothesis , is just as valid as intellegent design as a hypothesis . Actually , the uranian tapeworm hypothesis , . as far fetched as it may be , is more testable than a supernatural designer . I think maybe the kids SHOULD be taught intellegent design as an example of pseudo-science . Hopefully they will see why it is not science and why evolutionary theory is .
Yes , the university one is quite possibly the most nonsensical . I will never understand why people seem to think that the mere presence of a weapon makes it somehow more likely that there is going to be a problem . I have lots and lots of guns , right here at my house . Last year , the murder rate at my house was 0 . I think that we can most likely maintain the same this year . What school are you at ?
So you use the site to try and make a point and then call the site biased ... .How confusing . You then go on to talk about a how making abortion illegal will not reduce abortions ( a point I do n't really care about ) but unrelated to this topic ... so if you want to talk about that , start another thread . So do you still wish to defend Planned Parenthoods fake numbers ?
And where was Satan ? Slithering from the scene of every crime ...
and you bace clame on what ? that most violent crime is commited with out a weapon http : //www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/wuvc01.pdf and that when a firearm is used 87 % of the time it is a handgun ( not an AK47 , witch is a hollywood favorit , but not truth ) .
And thats my point , science operates on it 's means of accesing valid mechanisms . That said , science will only allow what IT decides is `` valid '' , just like the church . Science defines what is valid and what is n't , just like the church . `` Instantaeneous '' comunication and large volumes of scientists does NOT make science any more right , it meerly increases the volume of stuff that they come up with . And again , your point brings back the arguement that when technology proggresses further we may still discover things which force science to re-write their books . Your view is purely subjective , even the evidence itself is opinion .
just bumping this because it seems to have been overlooked ...
it totally emasculates our gun laws . That sums it up in a nutshell . And the nutjobs and control freaks wonder why we get P.O.ed at the suggestion of more feel good do nothing to solve the problem other than screw the law abiding gun control .
Is this a rational statement ? If so , prove it rationally , by science .
I see that you fail to see the logic that the less dominant Siamese twin ALSO has a right to their own body . One is not supporting the other - they are supporting each other so their rights are equal . Besides , both have a mental existence so , at least for me , abortion ( or , in this case , one being killed for the rights to body of the other ) would not be allowed .
I think you are right . One of my favorite Sidney Harris cartoons was two scientists coming out of a conference presentation , and one , absolutely thrilled , says to the other , `` What a wonderful talk - everything we know is wrong ! ''
So you 've got nothing to offer but a whining rant ? Just because you do n't like it , does n't mean that the evidence does n't exist . By the way , why do n't you offer some reliable evidence to support your foolish claims above . Creationist web sites do n't do it for me . Peer reviewed literature please .
Because of the board ?
Based on what evidence can you make this conclusion ?
sinjin - I did n't mean to imply any linkage between your opinions and those of another poster . Apologies .
So is cancer .
So we agree ... .. What I want to know is why the vocal homosexual 'lobby ' insists on the term `` marriage ? '' emclean , the sanctity of marriage would not be the only thing about marriage to be ( harmed ? ) changed . The whole definition of marriage would change , too .
That 's simply not true ;
Really ? I do n't think you know what you are talking about . Please provide evidence to back your claim . Thanks .
And you are proud of that ?
So if I understand this correctly , we should n't believe evolution because it has gaps , but we should believe ID even though no one will/can say when the design happened , where it happened , what it was , or who the intelligence was ? Is that about right ? Seems to me the ID is nothing but gaps . Whenever I push an IDer for details of their claims , all I get is an anti-evolution position . Not even IDers seem to be able to say why ID should be considered correct .
How do you know ?
There are two major theories , many hold to the `` Out of Africa '' replacement model . The perspective of the Out of Africa model ( often called Out of Africa II , referring to a second migration from Africa of a hominid population ) adherents is that when there was a migration of H. erectus out of Africa into Asia and Europe , these populations ( seen in materials like the Chinese and Indonesian erectus ) did not contribute a significant amount of genetic material to later populations that led to modern humans ( some claim no genetic ancestry to these groups and their descendants at all , a `` strict '' replacement model ) . At approximately 200 kya there was a second migration of hominids out of Africa . This time it was fully modern H. sapiens , which proceeded to replace whatever populations that then occupied Asia and Europe . Some see direct competition and extermination of the native populations , some see passive replacement due to better adaptive strategies , and some see genetic admixture with the preponderance of genetic material coming from the incoming human populations , eventually replacing and assimilating them into the greater collective . In this view there is a specific speciation event that occurred which led to the origin of H. sapiens in Africa , and this population is the forerunner of modern humans , leaving the European Neanderthals , Chinese erectus , and others out in the cold . Homo Sapiens
No they did n't Mutz , the animals came to them 2 by 2 .
yahooooooo ! ! ! ! ! ! !
Yes ... if you ignore people , they eventually go away ... except for me , of course .
Sorry but I think you are mistaken in that the bible `` describes '' dinosaurs . The first description is most certainly a description of the hippopotamus , which were abundant in Egypt , etc . The second seems to be crocodile of some sort . Most likely the Nile crocodile . Tanniyn is not just described as dragon , but also as serpent or scaly creature . At that time there was no other large scaly creature other than the Nile crocodile . They might have been describing a whale , but whales do not have scales . As to your claim of evolution , that depends on what `` God '' would mean by `` create . '' YOU can create something out of something else ca n't you ? So than evolution is a possibility .
No . you 're not making any sense . Where is symbiote ? I got a horrible argument for him to dispell .
And yes , I have seen the signs for help centers , and I think that is a good thing ... there should be organizations like that , to show women that there ARE other choices for them so that they do n't think that their only option is abortion . But I still feel that they should have the right to decide what they want to do ... but not just women.. if the father in question is involved , I think they should be a part of that decision too ...
Well if you are Catholic you would should probably find him pretty credible .
Nope . He was a great man who did n't believe in your cradle to grave liberalism . The founding fathers did not envision or want the all-seeing , all-knowing Federal government that you worship today . Nope . That government is best which governs the least , because its people discipline themselves . -Thomas Jefferson Restrictive ? Where do you live ? Britain ? That would explain a lot . The people there are used to being 'subjects ' rather than 'citizens ' . `` When the people fear the government you have tyranny . When the government fears the people you have liberty '' - Thomas Jefferson Again.. if you 're so convinced that gun-control works , then why do n't you place a sign in your front yard or on your door that reads : `` DOING MY PART FOR GUN-CONTROL : THIS IS A GUN-FREE HOME ! '' You 'd be wrong . MOST people are NOT coddlers of criminals like yourself .
Because , when each is in its natural habitat , they are reproductively isolated .

Okay . Most botanist are evolutionist but facts are often confusing to evolutionist .
I know of at least 3 personally , including my brother . He fought for custody for years and it nearly bankrupted him . He was trying to get his kids away from an ex-wife that would go away with her boyfriend for weekends at a time and leave their 15 year old daughter in charge of threee younger siblings .
You follow atheism because you do n't understand theism . It is Creation vs. Evolution BTW . I am a blunt person on the net . So excuse me . To put it plainly if you want a God get one , but if you do n't then forget about it live and die . Do you want a God or not ?
In your world you kill children for the mistakes of their parents . How am I implying that men are superior ? They should have to raise the child also as they are equally to blame . I love women and respect the great majority of them , if you think otherwise , you are mistaken .

Variation does tend to have a pattern . It is usually drawn as a bell curve , with the top portion being the most common variation on a trait .
Just because you do n't have a handle on what civil rights are does n't make the phrase arbitrary . It 's a legal term , not a catch phrase . I 'm not a lawyer , I could n't track down the exact definition they use in Massachusetts , but rest assured they have one .
Well i know it would n't be sensible for anyone to call my child an it that is just disrespectfull to both your partener and child .
You know 'my kind ' ? How very presumptuous on your part . Then you know individual choice is the issue , not enforced medical procedures . You did n't answer the question regarding pregnant women who intend to carry to term being required to have a sonogram .

Oh , good , I get to do this again ! They 're not Christians , just like Judge Jones is n't a Lutheran . ( Your foot should still be in your mouth over that one , but you never learn . ) They 're all phonies , are n't they , marc ? Lucky for marc , he can accurately assess people 's belief systems without knowing the slightest thing about their beliefs . But I have this `` power , '' too : marc is an atheist . Sure , he says all this fundie Christian stuff , but he 's really an atheist . I know it in my heart because my own belief system , infallible and based upon the teachings of God himself , tells me so . I know , because I know Christians , and marc 's not a Christian . He 's just a big phony . And there you go ... atheist . Clearly , I 've correctly labeled you , and you are nothing but a false teacher.Pathetic , marc . Absolutely , positively pathetic .
Just to be pedantic , a better analogy would be : `` If you are here , why do you have brothers and sisters ? ''
When 's the last time you heard of someone being killed by the accidental discharge of a fire extinguisher ? Or when the last time a fire extinguisher was stolen from a home and then used in the commission of a crime ? And do n't you think the likelihood of being in a car accident is greater than that of being required to shoot someone ?

Actually , after the fact calculations on either side are just noise . Humans do exist and I suspect that all statements of probabilities are incorrect . Further , I do n't think that coin flips are relevant and not even a very good analogy .
No . Perhaps some effort into educating yourself would be appropriate . I presume that you expected a yes answer and your next question would have been , `` why are there still monkeys/apes ? '' I sincerely request that you look at all of the skulls in the following two pictures . Please give me your opinion as to what each of these may be and how they came about .

So , how many unborn babies did your God drown in Genesis ? Talk about hypocrisy .
Just helping something live does n't affect evolution unless it affects the ability to reproduce viable offspring . If there was no nylon before the 1940s and there is an organism that can survive by eating NOTHING else , what does that tell you ? There could not have been a population of nylon-eating bacteria before 1940 . This is a new population that did not exist before .
The tactics pro-lifers use make the Nazis look like the little league . I mean , seriously . The reason we are dealing with terrorism is because women have the right to the abortion procedure . Wow . Please give me one way those two things relate to each other .
Actually depth has nothing to do with it . You can be shot through and through and suffer no serious injuries . What matters is what 's hit in the middle . Of course knife wounds are far worse . You 've got a small hole versus a deep gash that 'll cut arteries and organs in its path .

You go to hell when you do not ask for FORGIVENESS from your sins and ask Christ to govern your life and help you to stop sinning . I am still a sinner , but I am forgiven and I ask Christ daily to help me with my fleshly desires .

I 've added one now . It 's the first result if you google 'Creation : where 's ' . It 's also the top article in AiG 's 'Get Answers ' section , which is linked directly from the navigation bar on their front page .
Actually , it makes sense only to you . If you look at nature for just a little while , you willl become aware of a great deal of death . But it is mostly very economical since scavengers make sure that there is minimal waste .
The founding fathers were afraid to trust the common people with the right to vote . They did n't want mob rule and chaos . `` Most of the Founders believed that property ownership was essential to good citizenship and therefore that only property owners should be able to vote . 'Property ' , in those days , also included slaves , of course , and half of the Founders were slave owners ... .The maintenance of power in the hands of the elite was further strengthened by who could vote . In 1787 , there were about four million people living in the 13 original states . But only about four percent of them , it is estimated , could vote . Excluded were the one million slaves , the two million women , anyone under the age of 21 , and all non-property owners . '' http : //www.alternativesmagazine.com/22/lonsdale.html
Your XXX-umption that is a poor attempt to certify a false delimma has long been answered . How many people have been killed in Africa with short handled hoes and machetes ? Nary a gun amoungst them .
Are you trying to make a point here ? Or are you just spewing forth your hoplophobic tendencies because you 're got nothing better to do ? One of the problems with school children is that it 's become a crime to discipline them the way our parents were disciplined . There 's no spankings , corner times , or sitting on a chair with a dunce cap , because that 's all been labeled as abuse to emotional development . Instead we have counseling and the administration of powerful prescription drugs to kids who can barely read . Kids are spoiled rotten and left unsupervised with TV shows and video games that glorify violence and murdering people for fun . Parents are stuck working two or more jobs just to make enough money for bills so they do n't wind up on the streets . We need massive reform . We got ta go back to how kids were raised in the 50s .
Oh my goodness . This is a trick called semantics . I guess you got sucked in . Yes , abortion is used as contraception unfortunately .
Well , one person got it right ... where in the constitution does it say something about health having to be protected ?
To those who are sympathetic to gun control . Can we get anyone to listen and change society , ooooor will you just use this problem , and these under trained and under socialized kids to persecute the 2nd Amendment ! I am 61 years old , and I can remember when schools filled the gap and taught morals . Now they are not allowed for fear that they might offend someone & # 8217 ; s religious unbelief and be sued . We reap what we sow . If we sow nothing , we reap nothing .
So you know how foolish you are and hope that name calling will distract from that being recognized by everyone . Erectus skulls were smaller because the brain was smaller . You brought up KNM-WT 15000 ( Turkana Boy ) and you were n't even aware that as an adult he would have been about 6'1 '' tall ? Why is his skull smaller than modern humans ?
I think you just made the point that they 're people after a certain degree of development takes place .
It is my understanding that it involves only domestic violence misdemeanor cases with a conviction .

But you are smart enough to realize that the ban on gay marriage has nothing to do with it .

Just for the record , Hinata , what sorts of choices did you happen to make in the moments after you were conceived ?
But let me guess ... if they step down RIGHT after they find they will have to issue to gay couples , you 'd be in favor of them being able to be sued for it , simply because the `` discrimination '' in such an event was toward gays ? Right ? At least if you are consistent with your stance elsewhere in regards to 'timing ' ... Anyway , aside from that inconsistency with your position elsewhere , I agree that county officials should need to comply . After all , there are probably OTHER examples whereby county officials have to do things that they are religiously against , such as issue divorce papers . Or marry some drunk couple that they know are n't really being serious even though they 're tying the knot ... If all county officials could just refuse to do their job because of their objections -- for WHATEVER reasons -- it would be a collosal mess .
So atheism does n't `` need '' facts ? If it claims to have complete knowledge of evolution , does n't it need all the facts ? If the answer is no , then how can it argue against religion ? Miller did n't explain it .
******** . Utter fraking **** . Scientists have already accumulated mounds of evidence which suggest the common ancestor . You choose to ignore it as do most scientifically ignorant christians .
Is there something wrong with choosing to have a cheese sandwich as opposed to peanut butter and jelly ? Do you prefer actually having to make personal moral choices or do you need a rigid and inviolable instruction manual to run your life ?

I do n't think that any marriage rights are required at all by the Consitution .
Well , I can tell you that 2+2=10 , or indeed that 2+2=11 , and be correct .
And the theological implication of that is what ? P.S . Odd thing to about , no ?
Ten Commandments . Used as basic social norms .
Not just mine . I 'm in good company . Let 's remember that most of the `` theories '' you reject were formulated by people steeped in the same Judeo-Christian traditions as you and I . Why did they need the explanations science offered ? What if anything was lacking in their faith ? Did their work in science diminish their faith ? Is life any less `` miraculous '' when viewed through science ?
Yes . It 's not logical to simply cite , `` the Bible tells me so , the Bible was written by God , '' and consider that an argument . The Bible has been wrong . It 's also not logical to cite authority to God . It necessarily begs further questions about your God 's unproven existence to those who do n't believe in that God , or in any God . If we do n't simply believe in your God , on the basis of your presupposition , he can have no authority over the rest of us . One must come up with another argument . Should each religion have it 's own definition or completely different idea of logic , which favours that religion and its God ?
If our core is our mind , what is the mind ? It is the brain , which is an organ and considered a body part . In reality , `` mind '' is an intangible byproduct of the body . However , the brain depends on other organs like the heart and lungs to keep going . The heart and lungs are in turn regulated by the brain . As you have said before , we do n't have any evidence the mind lives on without the body . Therefore , it appears the existence of the mind is dependant on the existence of the body , not the other way around . This makes sense , since it is obviously the body that begins to develop first .
And it contains many scientific and historic inaccurate lines in it . What was your point ?
So ? Both are suggesting primate two-way evolution . Hence 'connection ' is established .
But I suppose the Pope is going to hell Here is a link to a website that has a brief list of translational fossils , there are gaps but that could mean that we have yet to find those fossils , or we have found them but no one has made the link yet . You also keep stating that evolution is theory , we all agree it is still a theory but it is the most plausible theory that fits the evidence found that Evolution is the most likely mechanism to explain that we have lots of different species , to condense it to the real basics just think of it as the ancestry of the species . ( Apologies for condensing the Theory into those small sentences could be here forever explaining Evolution ) N.B Evolution does not mention how life started , there is another Scientific Theory on the Origin of life on Earth , but I can not think of it at this moment . Hunter it is really not good form on a message board when debating a subject to say someone is going to hell because they do n't agree with your viewpoint , present your evidence why you believe that evolution is incorrect and we can have a proper debate .
my my you are up on the current events . Thanks for shedding light on this for everyone here .
So if everyone had a sign on them and a water pistol then would you be happier or does everyone need to have a gun ? Should everyone who has a gun have a sign as well ? Is the deterrent of a gun diminished without the sign ? I 'm also not going to address my brother in every single post . He is a shining example of why I do n't like guns but that does n't mean I 'm going to talk about him constantly .
Target shooting and handgun hunting , for starters . There 's also self-defense , although not many people seem to have a great desire to defend themselves . If there 's no legal use for a handgun , then why do all those cops carry them ?
Oh ? Do n't you think that since Jesus said that whosoever so much as hated their brother without a cause is a murder ? Or are you Jewish and do n't believe the New Testament ? Is that why you say the Bible says nothing about abortion , or just plain killing at all ?
I got an interesting tid bit for you : http : //www.2ampd.net/Articles/difiElitist.htm First read the text . The anti-gun senator is noted for having the ONLY legal concealed gun in the city of San Francisco . Also note as a person who carried a concealed gun and still keeps a .357 magnum for protection , that she should KEEP YOUR FINGER OFF THE TRIGGER , until your aming at your target .
My responses are in bold .
That 's great for women ! What about the rights of their children ?
Yes , the horror of voluntarily taking orders from someone in exchange for monetary rewards ! ! If you hate your job that much , quit . You are n't being oppressed because someone offered you the option to do something . If you do n't like it , do n't do it . If you hate trade , you can go wander through the wilderness and eat berries and roots .
Well , this guy is so bad ad arguing and so good at alienating people that if we sent him into the abortion forum , it is likely , he 'd be so ineffective at defending his pro-life position thathe 'd actually be contributing to the pro-choice position ...
As Mach pointed out , you ( Montalban ) are arguing with yourself here . You stated that `` bacteria needing nylon to survive '' is put forth as evidence for evolution . Then you said that an alternate view was that there are some bacteria that need nylon to survive . Anyway , an actual alternate view is that the experiments performed to determine whether the bacteria could survive on nylon alone could not have been exhaustive . There may still be a natural substance on which the bacteria survives . It may even be similar to nylon , but it has yet to be discovered . This is a big maybe , though .
Oh , I get it . So you believe , but you do n't exactly `` believe '' .
Just a newly-evolved structure . It happens .
OH FREE MARKET ? ? ? ? IM goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
Well , that just means I 'm a more capable lump of cells now than I was when I was first conceived . I started doing what most embryos do when they are first formed , and that is develop . I 'm still developing . I ca n't seem to stop it . I think my body has stopped growing ( in height anyway ) , but seem to keep filling my brain with more and more experience . The point I was trying to make is that since there is a continuum of existence between conception and death , there is no line you can draw ( save birth , which may or may not be considered an arbitrary boundary to personhood ) that would constitute some sort of a change in what you are . I started as one cell and continued to grow and develop , which I am still doing now . If I am a person now , I was a person when I was the zygote . If we are going to talk about aortion in this society we should be honest about it and not try to mince words when it come to killing a baby . I 'm not `` anti-choice '' but I think we should honestly recognize that an embryo is a living human individual that dies when it is aborted . That thought turns most people off so they have to make themselves believe that an abortion is not a killing since the embryo was n't a person . Logically , it is a killing . A life was ended . The question then becomes , is it murder ? I do n't happen to think that , but it is really quite subjective anyway .
Oh.. that makes sense . Because , it sounds exactly like modern day republicans .
Anybody who thinks guns have a phallic aspect is obsessed with sex and needs serious mental help .
Hello Aivlis , my name is Joe . Please let me tell you a little about my self . When I was twenty one I started dating my first girlfriend . She was seven years older then me . She had a seven year old little girl . I was working three jobs when we meet ( one full time , two part time ) . Within six months she was pregnant ( Yes we were stupid and did not use protection ) . I went out a bought a ring and proposed to her . She said yes . A short time later she told me she was going to get an abortion . I was devastated . I told her I would open a bank account in her name and have the pay from two of my jobs direct deposited into the account . I told her I would be there for her and our child . She still wanted to get an abortion . I told her I would raise the baby myself and that she would have no obligation , she still wanted to get an abortion . I told her I could not support her in this decision . The night before she went for the abortion , I begged her to reconsider . She would not . I wept like a baby because of this . I took me many years and the mercy and grace of God to heal from this life changing event . If there is anything I can say or do to get you to reconsider this please let me know . There are many people who would love to help you either keep your unborn child or find a safe loving home for him/her . My wife and I have a fifteen month old daughter , her name is Halley Raine . She is a real blessing , but she will never take the place of the child I would have had with my ex girlfriend . My other child would be about ten or eleven now . Please let me know if I can be of any help to you . What ever road you do decide to go down , I will be keeping you in my prayers .
And how exactly was that done and why do only you know this ?
And it provides no real insight to the issue . It states detail on California case , but makes little specification on any of the other states . Considering the opposition to interracial marriage was THREE to ONE AGAINST , it 's hard to believe that a state legislature would just decide to buck the electorate and legislate the laws away of their own volition .
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahahahahahaha . The deliberately out-of-context quotes again that directly contradict the conclusions of the authors .
Can you really see that Grizzly ? It would literally cause a revolution in certain States . Obama needs everybody on his side in the forseeable future . There wont be any real attempt for at least a generation I think . Not until the American public accepts a much more left wing government than they would today . As long as there is a lot of opposition I cant see it happening .
And how is your think group any different , you all think alike just as gun owners all think alike . So stop calling the kettle black .
Your use of the word `` replace '' reveals your ignorance of evolution .
Good . The less moronic `` spirituality '' in each state the better . Let 's move out of the dark ages as fast as we can .
You mean with brand new machineguns that no civilian can possibly own ?
So both daughters get daddy ****** , shag him and get pregnant . And considering that God smites people for just about anything and everything in the Bible , he seems silently approving in this case .
You wan na compare foreign nations even though no two stats are comparable or similar ? Fine , let 's look at China and their rising gun crime .
Well is n't that interesting . Germany has much stricter laws than America does when it comes to gun ownership , and their school shootings resulted in more death and devastation that Columbine . It 's funny in a way , because the country with the tighter regulations is seeing more killings on school grounds than America , even though our laws are n't as strict . I guess that means all the nonsense about `` more gun laws make people safer '' is nothing but bull .
No need . As soon as I see that a thread is started by supersport , that 's what I already expect to happen within a few days . I 'm sure I 'm not the only one .
Do n't you just hate the search function here ? Commercial Products of Creationism Fluid Mechanics , The Fossil Record and the Flood Communist Governments And that took me 3 seconds . Your grandiose claims of superiority and insults are rather moot given that anyone can do a basic search and show that your arguments and statements are essentially nothing more then self praise . The historical facts do not support basically anything you 've ever said . Quite frankly , I 'm not sure why anyone bothers with you given your ignorance regarding chemistry . I still love how you argued that Co2 was the reason that insects grew so large in the past .
What are you talking about ? I thought we were talking about changes in allele frequencies and differential reproductive success , and you barf out some nonsense about information and molecules to man . What does that mean ? How is that applicable to evolutionary theory ? Are you a parrot or can you actually define information . Are you talking about Shannon information ? Yaukey information ? What do you mean when you say `` information . ''

More hyperbole anyone ? To finish peddler :
So they 're failing because they 're XXXXXX ?
Really if this is another one of your fresh organic sample = age of decades of time capsule because they were both on top of the ground , you 're officially delusional .
Who said it did ? I was only pointing out the absurdity of gun control laws and how they lead to federal overlords deeming that your not capable of playing with matches . ( I would not be suprised if this were next . )
60 % accepting Roe v Wade is a high figure dont you think ? More people support abortion then the president .
This makes more sense then anything else I 've heard on this thread .
No-one experiences the existence of an outside world . Explanations such as the Matrix can explain sense impressions as well as some concept of 'external reality ' . We have no more evidence for one than the other . The fact no-one takes them seriously is a psychological point about human beings , nothing to do with reality per se .
I do not argue so much the quality of llife of an individual woman but more for the quality of life , indeed of having access to life itself , of the children of the woman involved , because in many situations the concern and nurturance of a mother may be the only thing keeping children alive , especially in poor , war-torn nations that do not enjoy the relative wealth of the United States .
Well , you get the idea .
College . They are normally studied for two years between the ages of 16 and 18 before going to uni .
Most of the time one should be able to tell the sex of the baby by about 20 weeks and very often even at sixteen . Second trimester starts at 12 weeks . You cant get an abortion after determining the sex because its illegal . Where are you getting your data ?
I do n't think this approach is all that new , but I have to admit that I have n't been around as many of the old-school creationists .
Indeed . At least you can express your shame .
What are you talking about ? The mother along with the father made the baby ... ... .
Actually , it is a mutation . Just like the color of the fur is a mutation . Polar bear fur is not white , it is colorless . Moreover , it is hollow . That is another mutation . And Polar bears have longer legs than their closest relatives , the brown bears . They have smaller ears . None of the changes are caused by `` friction '' . By the way , the webs between the toes of a Polar bear are very much like the webs between the toes of a duck . Adaptation is , by the way , evolution . I presume that is the word you meant to use . Adaptation is not adaption . You talk about the process as if it were adaption and then call it adaptation . In reality it is adaptation .
Tell that to CDC pathologists . Or just read this post . ETA : Alternatively , let 's look at the logic in this way : because the field of quantum mechanics is useless for helping me describe classical physical systems , quantum mechanics must be wrong . I think this illustrates the fallacy satisfactorily .
Not at all . The issue is receiving the marriage benefits . If gays were given all of the benefits of marriage for just living together , we would n't have a fight at all as you would have gotten what you want . It is n't the marriage that is important to you but the benefits . And the debate in Italy of singles who live together seeking marriage benefits also is a good example of the can of worms that will be opened if society concedes to the gay crusaders the undue rights they are demanding . Why is it absolutely impossible for you to reply to an issue without first redefining it to fit your warped World view ? Have you no objectivity within you at all ?
Well , not completely , but yes , quite the same . However , this is irrelivent- she was n't a person , because she was in a coma . Does that give me the right to kill her ? Of course not ! What about fetuses born in comas ? Can we kill them ? What about people in vegetative states ? After all , they ar n't perfect , so let 's kill them !
Simply having them is n't the point . It 's about being able to use them .
Try the link . You 've done the 'name calling ' , at least you could be honest about what you are doing .
Yes , but him knowing them does not mean they 're human at that point . He knows an full grown oak from the acorn , but it does n't mean the oak tree is an acorn , or the acorn a fully-grown oak tree .
Pretty good considering Darwin was n't aware of genetics . Too bad Wells is stuck in 1859 . The modern synthesis provides perfectly legitimate mechanisms .
Scientifically innacurate ? 1 word : Creationism .
But you must realize that it is not always the males fault . For sometimes the girl just decides that the male should not wear a condom , and in some instances she insists that he goes without one . So , when she finally cries wolf , why should he be held responsible ? Because she chose not to ? Sure , he should have his wits about him , and think about it , but it 's not all of his fault . I do believe in having to support the girl , but I do n't believe in that having that all based upon a promise . Words are words , she should have made sure that he followed them up with something before uncrossing her legs . It 's not always his fault , that she could n't hold them . He just got caught in the cross fire . While I am pro-life , I do n't believe that he should HAVE TO MARRY THE GIRL ! I do n't think that one mistake should cause them both to be tied down . And then , what if the guy turns out to be a slime-ball ? An abuser , rapist , murderer or something ? Then you 're subjecting both the girl , and the baby to a life of constant danger . I do n't think that 's fair to anyone . All in all , I think that the concept of child support should be kept in tact . That seems to work sometimes . Either that , or we , the people , should work out some sort of chastity pact . Something that enables the girls to have children , but does not allow it possible while they are young . That or having them keep the big V. Something other than the ideas that you proposed , although I do like your child support concept . That should be kept around . However , I do think that the other laws are reckless without thought .
And I see you refuse to address my point . This argument might have some relevance and validity if you would back it up .
I think you have a somewhat odd definition of `` assumption , '' but I see your point . Remember , the fundies will jump on anything they can ...
Such as ?
Just amazing .
Well , man might someday gain the capability of fully synthasizing a molecule as complex as DNA from scratch . Of course , he would use the knowledge gained from studying how various DNA codes affect natural biological characteristics in order to properly design that DNA to achieve the desired characteristics . It might be even more difficult to then take that synthesized DNA and put it in an egg and artificial womb that has no natural ( as opposed to artificial ) biological parts , but even that might be achievable someday through chemical construction . All this means is that humanity might someday be able to copy the methods of nature to create a new being - perhaps even use creativity to create beings of very different natural functions than we see in our world . It is all interesting to think about and could well be achievable within this century . We already are capable of a large degree of genetic manipulation through cloning and hybridization . One would think that it will only be a matter of time before more complex technologies get developed . The other question , of course , is - If we could someday create new life using our technology , should we ? That would bring up a whole host of issues , including : - Would we know what we were doing well enough not to cause great harm ? - How would the beings we create be treated ?
Science is not all knowledge , it does not have the answer for everything that is the religion of scientism that believes that . Science means to know but it does not know everything . It is a wonderful tool not the meaning of life .
hey , watch yourself ... ... ... watch it..
Because that 's the simple truth .
Zardozy , honey , whushoo got ta b'lieve in ? You related to that Frenchie guy with the skinny wife ?
Please note that I added the word `` human '' to your comment above IANGB . After all it is not my claim that all zygotes are human beings / `` persons . '' Agree ? Also , I want to make it clear that I am arguing only for the most basic of human rights ( life ) and not for the full panopoly of rights that say an adult human individual would have .
Yet more mythology . Do you have any evidence for your assertions ?
I 'm not going to go into what is wrong with the idea of God without knowing it is what we mean we speak the word . Excuse me if I am mistaken , but it seems that you are getting defensive on your belief before I even begin a debate . I 'm simply looking for any one wishing to participate on the nature / existance of God . If you find my questions to be complete nonsense and that I 'm only here to critize theism than you need not participate . thebootfitter ,
The problem here is that Christians ( such as I am ) consider the Bible to be Proof .
It 's sophomoric remarks like that that hurt the gay cause in America . God is n't mocked , though . And I doubt the people are either . And I 'm glad California outlawed the sin . The only thing you have left is to hope the far left , spiritually-stunted judges in the US Supreme Court are pro Sodom and Gomorrah .
Then we can conclude that you were n't being honest when you claimed you had done a detailed study of evolution . It seems that you made up your mind before you studied what creationists think of evolution .
Do n't expect your misrepresentations of the findings of those studies to sink in . I 'm not that easily fooled .
In other words , the author seems to think that because Mendel did n't know about genes mutating , we must continue to believe they do n't . Complete and utter nonsense from beginning to end .
Still dumb to compare the two . Both are no good . Theft is better then murder ... however a theif bragging because he did n't murder is a fool..Chris Rock actually did a funny skit on this . Stoner is not good , alcoholic is not good , herion addict is not good . You ask if I have evidence ... yes , my own two eyes . Do n't believe me then so be it , but there are many articles that say the effects of marijuana ... at the very least it is like smoking . I stress very least .
They are , but its their descision nonetheless .
It 's not an `` arrogant assumption '' to point out that religious faith involves making a `` leap in the dark '' - it 's a metaphor that attempts to illustrate the facts of the case . I 'm saying that given ADEQUATE EVIDENCE , science , IN PRINCIPLE , can answer all questions concerning the MATERIAL world . That is actually quite a limited statement if you bother to read it carefully . Pointing out some of the achievements of science which could not have been accomplished in any other way , is not `` raising science on a pedestal '' - it 's merely reciting the obvious . Yes , I am saying that reasoned arguments from anthropology can and do account for the evolution of morals , the law , etc . in human societies . The growth in complexity of physical organisms is analogous to the growth of social complexity in human societies : the study of the former can throw light on the development of the latter . I have not tried to address the torrent of `` points '' that cascade into the of rest of your post : I do n't understand what you 're talking about . As for the allegation that I 'm driven by `` ideology '' - I have n't a clue what sectarian policies you think control me .
So sorry , I was trying to figure out why God lets some women down , and yet favored you . I always assumed it was a mixture of physiology , luck , etc . Sometimes bad things happen , sometimes good things happen . But you claimed God was the one who saw you through and made sure your daughter was born healthy and functional ... So , again , in a similar situation ( trust in God , doctors say baby will be born damaged , etc ) , if it turns out the doctors were right , is God to blame for letting me down ? Or was it , in fact , just the way things are sometimes ? Or does God just randomly hear some prayers , but not others ? No , no ... lem me guess . `` God has a plan for us all '' ?
It is an acronym for 'Y'oung 'E'arth 'C'reationist . In other words ... someone who believes that the earth is only 6,000 - 10,000 years old and was created in six days by a being known as God .
Jesus did not post post nonsense on the internet , from the garden of Gethsemane internet Cafe or else where . The mockery creationists receive is of a different breed to the mockery Jesus got , and well deserved .
If you think evolution can not explain any change then why pick the avian lung in particular ? Maybe try and show how genesis can integrate almost or more observations in a meaningful way than evolution , then genesis competes , otherwise it does not .
Since always ?
Yes , IF you conclude that abortion is wrong , then you still have a responsibility to address the social problems that cause it to occur before you can ban it . But if you do n't think it 's wrong , then you have no such responsibility . Also , Sigma makes a good point on this issue .
You 're right , as well as having the institution of marriage on the line . But you are the one who seems to think this is a game , based on your posts . ( with your comments like `` you 've won '' ; `` he 's lost '' , and other silly things , as if this is a basketball game or something . ) It seems you 'd do well to take your own advice . If you want people to constantly have to `` justify '' something to you , then you should make your own compelling arguments first ; throw something out there yourself rather than expect everyone else to do it for you . No one owes you anything here . As for me , I 'm not interested in your little games .
Yes I think you are right .
Well , I 'll forgive you . But if you 're going to make comments about my willingness to post in another thread , should n't you read that thread first ? Should n't you read my posts in that case ? It did involve you because you referred to it .
Well he can defend his tax difficulties by claiming he is a creationist and thus can not be trusted with quantitative processes involving a bit of mathematics . Then again he can tell IRS that GOD will provide and they should contact Bush to get Gods cell number . I am sure that IRS , GOD , and Hovind can work it all out .
I think that 's a good question . I also wonder how long the medical establishment has had this rule ? Since there must be some long-standing procedures in executions in the United States that require , by law , a doctor 's supervision .
Got evidence to back that up ? ? I 'm not sure how a stoner 's worse than an alcoholic really . -Wez
The whole `` change the definition of marriage '' is mainly a scare tactic used by anti-gay religious bigots . They do n't seem to realize that words can have several meanings .
Actually , they have . But only Leviticus and Numbers .
That in a nutshell sums up your total knowledge .
So the number of deaths due to hospital screw up is almost 19 times higher than the murder rate involving firearms . Quite disturbing if you ask me . To this this suggests that we should look into more tightly regulated medical degrees than anything else .
So youre saying what is taught in schools is a scientific decision , not a political one ? Should abortion decisions be made by science , not politics ? After all , its a medical science right ? How do we decide what is a scientific decision vs a political one ? Youre considering no scientific merit to be an objective conclusion . Its not , since the scientific community has proven itself to be a very questionable judge of what is science and what is not . The scientific community is proven to have a worldview bias .
But pro-lifers often base the pro-life stance on preventing harm . Not just religion . ( And in this case they are one-in-the-same anyway . ) This is n't a case of harm-preventative-morality versus religious-morality ; it 's a case of two harm-preventative moralities in conflict , due to each only focusing mostly on one aspect ( either the mother or the unborn baby ) .
Many were ignorant in the `` dark '' ages .
Its true .
Then show the evidence .
You think `` the unborn child is worthy of protection '' ... '' but not more so than the mother , probably less '' ... yet you believe `` in most circumstances the child should be carried to term ? ''
And because a few people of weak faith and limited thinking declare mythology to be history does n't make it so . There is nothing logical about accepting mythology as fact . There is nothing to distinguish the creation myths of the Bible from creation myths of any culture .
Sorry did I say pacifist ? I meant yellow bellied pacifist.However if its any consolation , I meant anti 's in general not just you Sinj.sorry if it sounded that way .
And I have never seen a non-living process chase a rabbit either . But that does not imply by any logic which I have ever encountered that rabbit chasing is a key characteristic of all living organisms . Perhaps in your world some means all but not in mine . The question is not whether SOME living systems exhibit volition , some do . The question is whether ALL living systems exhibit volition - many do not . Those that do not could not have evolved at all if evolution requires volition .
Just a technical point . Evolutionary theory does not require that mutations should be random . Molecular geneticists are well aware that some genes in some organisms mutate more often than others ; alternatively , some genes are conserved more strongly than others . It 's just that hotspots apart , there is no evidence for result-orientated directed mutation of genes . Within certain constraints , they appear to be random , but evolutionary theory as such does n't demand that they should be . Second , natural selection through competition for resources is n't the only force constraining evolution ( though it is the major explanation of adaptation ) . There is also genetic drift which can distribute neutral mutations through populations , and there are probably also other factors such as structural constraints and canalisation affecting which mutations can see the light of day ( i.e . get exposed to natural selection ) and which will not .
And the man who impregnated the woman should walk away totally free of all responsibility ! Spoken just like an total misogynist !
And we agree that it is a physical entity ... the same as any cell of human origin ... in fact , the same as anything else that exists in the physical world . We 're two-for-two .
If we were to debate whether God made us perfect as he could have , then of course we can make the point that he obviously does n't exist .
Hey , I said let 's just ignore the fundemental problems . If the flood did happen what should we see ?
Well , I 'm sincere in how I interpreted what he wrote , and I honestly believe that is what he meant .
But I think that is the point . What if you did n't agree with the germ theory of disease ? Does that mean that it should n't be taught in health classes in our schools ? Should it be replaced by the bad humors of night air theory ? But not everyone agrees with that theory either .
Well firstly we do not know that `` volition '' must be embodied in living organisms only - computers MIGHT be capable of exhibiting it . I think you will find that there is NO valid reason for believing otherwise . And volition itself is NOT a defining characteristic of life . No biologist would buy that assumption . Sponges , bacteria , corn plants etc etc etc are mindless organisms and so far as can be determined do not act out of volition .
If I am to believe in something even if it 's scientific , I should be able to challenge the belief 's of the person who 's pushing it . If they do n't believe in what they 're selling , why should I .
So newborn babies only have no Christian beliefs because Satan has removed them ? My position would be that the 'natural ' ( read : before external influences ) state of a person is atheism , for the same reason that you 'naturally ' have no belief in gremlins . People are n't born with beliefs , they are naturalised into them - whatever that belief may be .
To a small extent , this happens already . Oftentimes ( 21.3 % , U.S. ) , a woman decides to have and abortion because she can not afford a baby ( from here , source ) . This is in effect removing members of society who are non-productive ( babies produce virtually nothing useful until they mature by about 10 years ) . And poor families are less productive , since they are often on welfare . Granted , this is a rather harsh perspective , but the effect is the same : In the U.S. , there are about ( 21.3 % X 1.31 million ) 280,000 less people every year who would have likely grown up in a poor home ( assuming the child would n't have been adopted ) . Forced contraception/abortion is seen as an effective way of solving poverty in some parts of the world ...
I see you know nothing about the subject ... hardly a surprise .
Yet without it the vessel is just worms , mud , then dust , like rock & amp ; tree houses , not made to endure , yet , the life force , energy , back to the cosmos/source , converted , capable of being rewinded , paused , and fastfowarded , like a movie screen amongst the stars , revealing our lives .
None . Embryos are n't babies .
That would most likely ( imo ) reduce the number of abortions performed . It would depend , I think , on how viable it is to transfer the embryo into the artificial womb . Forced surgery would not be an option if I had anything to do about it .
The `` accomplishments '' you list are done with firearms trace data , which the ATF and law enforcement has access to . And this success means that there 's absolutely no justification for any other type of registration system , because the information is already available to everyone that needs it , and all you 'd be doing is making a duplicate list of what 's already available to the people who need it . It 's like having five copies of `` War and Peace '' simply so you can have one in each room of your house because you 're too lazy to carry your book around with you .
I do n't understand your question . If law-abiding gun owners were overwhelming those who should not have access to guns , those who use guns unlawfully , I would be very pleased . But , as far as I can see , the only goal of the gunners is to make sure that everyone has a gun , no matter how insane , no matter how stupid , no matter how incapable they may be to own such easy-to-use instruments of death .
I know many people at my high school alone raised with 2 fathers or 2 mothers . There was a recent debate held at our school between 2 people about gay marriage and when one said this the other said that he was raised by 2 gay male parents . The other responded with `` But you seem so normal '' . How do you know that there are negative consequences of growing up without both a mother and a father . And also this is of course why we do n't allow single mom 's and single dad 's to raise children , right ?
You should have said that . I might have agreed with you .
Well , man has been called the third chimpanzee . Cladistics is some decades old now , and it has suplanted the old Linean system . While discoveries are still assigned genus and species names , evaluation of morphological charisteristics by computer yield much more realistic evolutionary trees .
It is impossible to read something that cant be found .
I think we should not spend inordinate amount of resources on trying to determine who is homeless and if it his own fault . Anyway , whose business is it where someone lives ?
On the issue of not living at all i '' m not shure there is a reasonable answer as to how someone who was never born could possibly recognise not exsisting as being `` worse than living ... `` Let me say I personally do n't like the idea of aborting a pregnancy . However I ca n't possibly understand how we would not FIRST adopt all those kids in homes first and then fight the battel for saving the unwanted unborn .
Define innocent in this context . Innocent implies intent .
I 'll have to apologize here , SoC . I confused you with another poster who also used Christ in his handle . You did n't run from the topic because you were n't the OP of that thread . Sorry about that . If you 'd still like to approach that thread , I 'll respond and provide the link , but all readers should be clear that my accusation that SoC scampered away was mistaken , and any willingness to address the arguments would be solely to SoC 's credit .
It is rather disrespectful but do n't think it is limited to one side . Most protestors on both sides are n't great . one thing did spark my interest , and it is said often , why is it a `` hard decision '' if you are pro-choice ? Is it hard because you do n't know if you want a baby around or not ? Could n't this decision be just as hard before being pregnant ? Even so , why link it to going to an abortion clinic ? You hear `` It was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place '' but how is going through some protestors making this decision harder ? No one would admit to this but it is statements like `` It was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place '' that make me believe that someone realizes it is wrong and the struggle that makes it hard is whether or not to do the right thing or do they thing that would benefit you the most . And in that case , I agree ... that can be a tough decision .
But they did n't have sexual relations . This was from a sperm bank- there was nothing that made the two people create one being . Nonetheless , this is a side issue for future debates . My main point is homosexuality is a disorder that the government should n't be condoning . The government obviously does n't condone pedophilia , poligamy , and incest . Why is the government condoning homosexuality ?
Oh damn it ... and I was going to sell this joke and retire !
No I do n't think that tying your tubes is abortion . I only think abortion comes into play when there is actually cells forming to make a baby , and you get them scraped out , or abort a baby before or after the third trimester . Plus I heard that if you tie the tubes , when you decide you want a baby you can untie the tubes , to conceive a baby . But burning is another thing . But unless there is actual cells forming it is not abortion
Alright , I 'll accept your term of punish . If you did n't fully understand what I was trying to say in my last post , here is a quick run down of it . Abortion = Punish Child If God is good he would n't punish an aborted child Therefore an aborted child will go to heaven If this were not true then God would be punishing the child I hope this is clear . I simply wanted to make the point that if you believe an unborn has a soul already , then aborting the child simply means it gets to go straight to heaven . That is not really a bad deal for the child .
So the radiometric data stand : the Earth , moon , and older meteorites are all 4 or so billion years old , not just a few thousand . Changing Decay Rates ? Another Creationist attempt to counter radiometric dates that are incompatible with their young-Earth religious position is to claim that decay rates are not constant , thereby throwing a monkey wrench into the calculations . There are at least two problems with this argument . First , it is not at all clear how varying decay rates could result in multiple decay sequences all agreeing on the age of an object . Remember , for example , the oldest exposed rocks on earth , dated using different parent radioisotopes ? All five of the decay sequences ( Rb-Sr , Pb-Pb , U-Pb , Th-Pb , and Lu-Hf ) clustered right around 3.7 billion years . If decay rates vary enough to throw off dates by billions of years , why would they vary in exactly the way needed to consistently produce the same results ? Second , radioactive decay of nuclei is not comparable to chemical reactions . In chemistry , the rate at which chemical reaction proceeds can be altered in a number of ways , such as by changing the temperature , acidity , pressure , or reactant concentrations . Such changes , however , have essentially no effect on nuclear decay . In fact , experimental attempts to alter decay rates have been made , but failed .
You made it sound like humans and dinosaurs were competing and we got a lucky break by having a meteor knock off the dinos . If mammals had died off , we would n't be around to know about it .
the cricket in the pliers feels pain ... When you start to squeeze a cricket with a pair of pliers , it starts to wiggle and tries to get away so as not to get crushed by the pliers . Is it because the cricket feels pain ?
And yet the atheist belief system allows for everyone to have their own seperate set of morals . According to the Atheist system , what Hitleror Stalin did was perfectly moral because those atheists believed that what they were doing was moral . Disgusting if you ask me .
And yet , even though creationists ask for detailed lists of every creature in transition over a period of several million years , I have never found a single creationist who can trace his ancestors back to Adam , a period of only about 6,000 years . The best I can do is to trace my ancestors back to the 1600s .
Some references please ? In general , it seems that most climatologists agree that severe weather systems will occur more frequently with an increase in average global temperature . ( ref : http : //www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/061.htm # 1434 )
You were n't referring to your home in your little story of helplessness .
The purposeful taking of life regulated by the government is something that is decided by the people . The people decide what determines what is allowable and what is not . When it is acceptable and when it is not . This is done in agreement , obviously not unanimous . Theses laws are created by the view of society at the time . Our society permits the ability to change those laws as our values change . You may call it murder , but you are wrong . There is no logical argument you can present to make your view correct . To suggest that legal abortion is anything else is an expression of your frustration why others do n't share your views . There is no logic in your argument it 's pure emotion and an immature understanding of how to cope with problems that do n't go your way . If you think your view is indeed the view that is best for the people then be thankful in the US the opportunity exists for you to effect that . I can assure you though lieing about it , sensationalizing it , bullying people about it is n't going to get many people to consider you . Please do us both a favor before you go off on a discourse of the rights , or feelings or value of the fetus remember what I said about we as a society decided what is acceptable and what is not . We make these laws for ourselves for that reason , because we do attempt to value life . That attempt does not always satisfy all of the people all of the time , but it never will . I do n't need a formula to understand how our society functions nor do I stomp my foot and throw insults or intimidate people who do n't see you being right . Nor would I justify behavior that from anybody else concerning something of less import would be unacceptable . If you do n't like the law , then do something about it . If this is what you deem to be the best and most effective way to do that , I suggest you find a to become comfortable with it .
'Life threatening condition that is always physically harmful '' ? What a giant load of steamy BS . Rarely is pregnancy physically harmful and even rarer is it life threatening . There are over 6 Billion people on this earth today . If motherhood was so damn dangerous , do n't you think the population would be a lot lower , even if it was just due to mothers keeling over after giving birth ? Where do you get this BS from , Planned Parenthood ?
Actually , I do n't remember that they did . What they did take bets on was that AIG would be able to find enough stupid people who would buy into their ignorant and scientifically illiterate tripe . As I recall , most who were actually aware of how stupid creationists can be bet that they would be able to do so . So now , besides their other so called 'peer reviewed ' magazine , they want to pretend that they are doing science here .
Evolution 's evidence is that life is similar , you wo n't be able to find an exception I am sure .

And I would appreciate your refraining from calling your mythology a theory .
The point is you dancing in the blood , of at least one innocent . Why else post this ? Especially with no comment ?
Liberals were responsible for things like abolition of slavery and women 's suffrage that overturned the oh-so-traditional status quo . Now we 're working toward death with dignity for the terminally ill , reasonable gun control , access to abortion and contraception ( without sparking the ire of fundy parents and community members ) ... are these things that are despised by the rest of the world ? No , but things like slavery , sexism , rampant crime , and politicization of private issues are .
The US is still the closest thing to a pure capitalist country in the world . But you are correct , our system is not a pure capitalist one . We have reminants of all types of systems including socialism . In the modern world I do n't think a society as large as the US is could be run under just one pure system .
Well , I ca n't stop you . But if some creationist says `` But in that other thread you said evolution meant , blah , blah , blah ... '' do n't come crying to me . Ok , getting off my soapbox now , I 'd say you 're totally right . Certain branches of Christianity , like Catholisism , have traditionally been very resistant to change . Unwilling to adapt , one might say . And the Catholic church has been in a state of decline of late . The social climate in which Catholosism thrived no longer exists , and so it is n't doing as well . We also see lots of little churches springing up , filling religious enviromental niches , as it were . What can we predict for the future ? Here 's my guess . The two main enviromental factors that will shape religion will be a desire for stability and an ability to adapt to new ideas . As communication and travel become easier , people will be exposed to more new ideas and cultures , and religions will be forced to deal with people saying `` Yeah , but what about this new idea I just heard ? How does that fit in ? '' On the other hand , as people get exposed to other ideas , they 'll want to have some core of ideas of their own to hold on to . Sort of a psychological anchor . I figure we should expect to see the more dogmatic churches fade away , as people become exposed to more , different ideas . If you ca n't adapt , you become extinct . Churches that espouse firm moral ideas based on humanisitic reasoning will probably do well .
I thought I had worded my post quite clearly . I even pointed out that it appeared that Dembski thought that there were only three laws of thermodynamics and claimed to have discovered a 4th ( which he of course named the 4th law of thermodynamics ) . He seems unaware of the zeroth law .
A rational mind .
Well , that would seem pretty obvious under that definition that it did not arise because of a single court case .
Well let me say that so far that you have n't been doing a very good job . My arguments are completely solid , and you have n't even gotten close to refuting them . You accuse me of being stupid because my mom watched star trek , you refute my arguments by providing the defonition of masturbation and periods , and then you call me illogical and tell me to think about my statements more deeply . [ quote ] You said that you can only abort in the first and second trimester , which I already know . But saying that you do n't exsist in these stages is a huge misstatement . [ quote ] Let me rephrase that . The beginnings of my body existed . What you know as `` me '' the person who 's saying this , did not exist . My brain , which is really `` me '' did not exist .
You should refrain from calling others arrogant Mr. Kettle .
Not too wordy as much as too BS'y . Ok , how about ... currently legal physician inflicted murder of unborn humans ?
I would agree , except that there are situations where the data supports two ideas . If it appears to support both ideas equally , what do you do ?
But no one ever claimed that they were glued on the trees for any other reason that to show the protective coloration . Why is that a fraud ? Would n't it be better that you actually learned the facts rather than allowing someone else to dupe you with this misinformation .
And yet it is the will of the people that must voice this moral obligation . I feel that bitter politics upon both sides has cast a dark cloud over any sort of serious debate over the matter . It is seen more of as a democratic potential victory or a republican loss than the real meaning behind such legislation which is to improve the quality of life among our citizens . More often than not issues that become important and even dire to our nations well being are simply twisted into political capital rather than seen as an improvement for the common good of all people .
As should be plainly obvious , this is an almost total ban on all semi-automatic weapons in the City of Columbus , not just those that have been traditionally considered 'assault weapons ' ( automatic firearms ) . Note definition ( L ) ( 2 ) . Almost every semi-automatic pistol is included in that definition . Whether an all-out ban on guns is good or bad ( or constitutional ) , or an assault-weapons ban is good or bad ( or constitutional ) , it should be obvious to any reader that the Columbus city council is trying to push through an all-out ban on guns by calling this an assault weapons ban .
1 ) the theories and laws constantly change , so it 's not like there 's one standard that 's benn kept to . At best the 'theories and laws of science ' are statements that fit with as many experiences and events as possible 2 ) If someone reports something against science , it 's rejected as 'unscientific ' 3 ) I 'm rejecting the certainty of experience , so using experience to prove it is circular
No , actually they used the Bible as a basis for their morality . They then applied that morality to the design of a system of government that they wanted to create .
You made the claim . Another lie from the radical cheap seats !
Slippery slope .
`` One day you 're going to realize that you 're `` evangelizing '' and `` witnessing '' have pushed far more people away from religion then has brought them in . '' `` You 're not telling people about God , you 're guilting them and putting them down . You 're drawing an imaginary line that separates `` us '' from `` them '' , and you 're cutting yourself off from other people . When Jesus `` evangelized '' ( I believe with all my heart he would hate that word ) , he made honest friends , not with the purpose to `` convert '' them . He did n't hand them a track and scare them into being a Christian . No wonder people hate Christians , for God 's sake I 'm starting to hate Christians . '' Maybe you should follow your own advice ... jim : Yes , God loves Saddam but He hates the way he is acting .
And this here shows exactly what type of a person you are . Why do n't you post as to the topic of the thread instead of trying to start arguments ? It 's really sickening . ON the subject of your starting arguments , I notice you selectively ignored my view that I posted . Could n't come up with an argument ?
Thus showing in that analysis which include all possible codes ( not only biosynthetically restricted codes ) that the genetic code is partially optimal with regards to error minimization . It should be noted though that analysis only included a subset of the possible optimality feature of the code . From article 3 The analysis above did not include other nearly optimal features of the genetic code including : A ) The actual code is far better than other possible codes in minimizing the number of amino acids incorporated until translation is interrupted after a frameshift error occurred . B ) The code is highly optimal for encoding arbitrary additional information , i.e. , information other than the amino acid sequence in protein-coding sequences . Thus , two more features for which the code is close to being optimal . What is interesting about these two optimal features is that they may facilitate evolution i.e . the code is primed for the future by being optimal in allowing future incorporation of additional information . In article nr.4 The coevolution theory of the origin of the genetic code is discussed . The theory suggests that the genetic code is an imprint of the biosynthetic ( biosynthetically restricted ) relationships between amino acids . A few interesting observations can be made : Firstly , from the article :
So it seems that gay people and our families are to remain 2nd class citizens to preserve this evil mans heterosexual privledge . How is it that `` the way he was brought up '' is more important then protecting gay people ? What of they way gay people were brought up ? What about the threat to our freedom that Brian Kolb and his evil religion and political party represents ? I was brought up by my father , taught in school that all people are equal . His refusal to extend marriage to gay people is a threat to me and I do feel harmed and it is a challenge to the way I was brought up . I do live in Michigan and not in New York but his evil statements and attitude are the same here if not worse . I was shocked to find out the Romney was the son of a former Michigan governor and that he is from Michigan . Does figure with all the anti gay religious nut cases that are swarming in the woods here in Michigan .
Hey thanks for the `` edited/out of context sermon . '' Peter was rebuked for interfering with the plans of God . Oh . . . Christ never said to throw the sword away . . . `` put it away '' means put it away in the sheath . Mark 8 : 31 And He began to teach them that it is necessary for the Son of man to suffer many things and to be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and to be killed , and after three days to rise again . 32 And He spoke the word openly . And taking Him aside , Peter began to rebuke Him . 33 But turning around and seeing His disciples , He rebuked Peter , saying , Go behind Me , Satan , because you do not mind the things of God , but the things of men . 34 And calling near the crowd with His disciples , He said to them , Whoever desires to come after Me , let him deny himself and take his cross , and let him follow Me . 35 For whoever desires to save his life , he shall lose it . But whoever shall lose his life for My sake and the gospel , that one shall save it . 36 For what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world , yet damage his soul ? 37 Or what shall a man give as an exchange for his soul ? 38 For whoever may be ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation , the Son of man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father , along with the holy angels . Matt 26 : 47 And as He was yet speaking , behold , Judas came , one of the Twelve . And with him was a numerous crowd with swords and clubs , from the chief priests and elders of the people . 48 And the one betraying Him gave them a sign , saying , Whomever I may kiss , it is He ; seize Him . 49 And coming up at once to Jesus , he said , Hail , Rabbi . And he ardently kissed Him . 50 But Jesus said to him , Friend , why are you here ? Then coming up , they laid hands on Jesus and seized Him . 51 And , behold , one of those with Jesus , stretching out the hand , drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest and took off his ear . 52 Then Jesus said to him , Put your sword back into its place . For all who take the sword shall perish by a sword . 53 Or do you think that I am not able now to call on My Father , and He will place beside Me more than twelve legions of angels ? 54 How then should the Scriptures be fulfilled , that it must happen this way ?
Nonsense . The US has yet to become a democracy . In any case , the republic-style government ( democracy of the elite ) replicates ancient Athenian government very closely , and is a very twisted take on the Haudenaushonee ( 6 Nations- Mohawk , Oneida , Onondaga , Seneca , Cayuga , Tuscarora ) , who were an actual democracy thousands of years before European invasion .
And , as I have shown , that is the wrong thing to do . The only criteria for choosing a hypothesis is the data .
No worries . I actually had to read it twice before I caught that - at first I was thinking the same as you did .
The actual law :
Mormons believe that Satan is the brother of Jesus .
So , it was a form of birth control ?
Things like future proof of a young earth - evolution needs billons of years . Or proof of severe weather conditions that would destroy the evolutionary process . Life on earth dies completely if it gets out of a fairly narrow temperature range , any time during those billions of years .
YOu know this how ? Because I did n't post in those threads ( mainly ) ? If you check my posting style I tend to weigh in when I think something needs to be said . Other than that I generally just read without comment . I seem to recall commenting on your style of summing people up at range before ... .
So then the anti abortionists POV should , in your opinion , overrides the POV of the woman that the issue concerns ? Why is it that to you the religious belief of the anti abortionist is more important then the body of the woman ? The fetus is a parasite on the woman , just as a tape worm is . Are you then saying that if the cult of the tape worm arises , then their religious belief should then be forced upon those who suffer from tape worms . Yes I know there is a difference between fetuses and tape worms but the principle is the same . Is someone elses religious belief more important then to be secure in your person and body ?
Microevolution has occured . Several times over and recorded in the lab and the natural world . [ quote ] Give me one peer reviewed paper . Just one . Not the latest dogma from talk origins . 29 evidences for bs . [ quote ] Huh . Guess you 're wrong . [ quote ] Talk Origins does your thinking not mine . Give me peer reviewed documents not the latest political/religious factions babblings . Of course they do n't exist but how could they ? [ quote ] And how does that mean evolution is wrong and creation is correct ? You do realize that even if you somehow manage to prove evolution false ( not likely ) , you are still miles from proving creation right ?
haha , so because of this you should make fun of men and not women ? That makes no sense but I figured you 'd say this .
You mean marc 's ? I never tried to do that .
`` Healthy Families '' seems like a strange name for this group that the link is to .
Irrelevant . Even if we assume that accusations of religion 's negative influence are misplaced , two wrongs do n't make a right . Either Darwinism and social atrocities are related , or they are not . Frankly whether they are has nothing to do with whether evolutionary theory is true or whether science expels dissenting opinion . The topic is completely tangential to the alleged point of the movie , which is because the movie is pure propaganda intended to dupe people like marc into thinking that these issues are topical . The classic example is : gravity makes countless people fall to their deaths every year . This is n't an example of one Holocaust-like instance of mass death ; no , this is continual , yet nobody has made a fuss about it in the scientific community . This is because scientists are evil and out to destroy dissenters by letting gravity do the dirty work . We must dispel this mythical gravity idea as pseudoscience and replace it in schools with Intelligent Falling theory .
Really ? ? ? Maybe you should do a little research before you make sweeping statements like that . -- http : //www.rainbowbaptists.org/
Not needed ? It is evolution . The collor of the moths is genetic - caused by 2 alleles of a single gene . The frequencies of those alleles were observed to change in the populations of moths over many generations . It is by definition , evolution .
Does n't matter if they `` give it up '' or not . They do n't legally issue death certificates for abortions . Imagine that . Death certificates are ONLY issued to once living persons . OH WAIT ! ! ! I think we just proved that a ZEF is not a `` person ''
It 's still not right for religious people to have to never speak their beliefs . It 's a form of tyranny .
But was this recent version of Chritianity exported form America ? I know these sorts make us laughingstocks to many in other countries , especially the televangelists .
Really ? If `` nature '' meant for all things to reproduce through heterosexual methods then maybe all other forms of reproduction would not exist , hmm . They would have been `` eliminated '' because heterosexuality is far superior . Think again . The majority of organisms on this planet reproduce using binary fission ( bacteria dividing ) , asexual reproduction ( there goes your `` individual gratification argument ) , and zygotic reproduction . None of these things require sexes of any type . Even animals that have `` normal '' sexual reproduction can reproduce using a process known as parthenogenesis , in which only a female is required to produce offspring ( turkeys and lizards do this ) . If homosexuality is n't natural or is inferior , then why do we see examples of it in nature . The bonobo ( closely related to the chimpanzee ) exhibits heterosexual and homosexual activity in both genders in the wild , and the bonobo and humans share a very common ancestor . Look , you ca n't say that one way of reproduction is `` the standard '' since it is clear that different species reproduce in a variety of ways . You also ca n't say that homosexuality is a disorder if you follow your previous logic that what is `` natural '' is valid . Also , you said that heterosexuality is superior because it has a `` greater purpose '' . By implying that something has a purpose , you stray from the realm of Science by assuming a teleology . If you want to assume that things were given `` purpose '' by some higher being , that 's fine , but you 'll have to stick to religion to defend your argument . In science , it is impossible to assume a purpose . For example , what is the purpose of a river ? To flow to the ocean ? To carve a canyon ? To carry sediment ? You can say what something is good at doing , or what it does , but you can not say what it was `` made '' for ( purpose ) without implying some grand design that can be easily provided by your local religion . As for hetero and homosexuality , it can be said that heterosexuals are better at producing offspring than homosexuals . Does that automatically make heterosexuality superior based on the arbitrary criterion of number of offspring produced ? So in the eyes of a value system that believes that something is valued higher that creates more offspring or `` life '' , heterosexuality would be superior . But in the eyes of science and reason , your argument does n't hold water .
Well , I 'm told that the upper limits have been extended by more accurate instruments , but I 'm an old bugger who learned 50,000 years for carbon dating . I 'm going to stick with that until I 've seen some real data .

Form 4473 , question 11a reads as follows : 11. a . Are you the actual buyer of the firearm ( s ) listed on this form ? Warning : You are no the actual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm ( s ) on behalf of another person . If you are not the actual buyer , the dealer can not transfer the firearm ( s ) to you . Sarah Brady lied on the background check form , she bought the gun on behalf of her son and supplied it to him , thus ensuring that he would n't have to worry about the NICS check red flagging him . By gun control standards she 's guilty of a straw purchase and should 've been sentenced to ten years without parole in a federal prison .
Quick question - What particular qualification of Dr. Olson 's makes his opinion on the subject superior to all others ? Given your fondness for posting this essay of his ( in his entirety ) as your ultimate justification , that should be an easy one for you . Waxy
is this serious ? Why can I find nothing more about it elsewhere ?
You obviously misunderstood the question . The question was , `` how does one explain evolution ? '' Instead , what you have offered is the creationist straw man assertion about what evolution is . Of course , evolutionary theory has no more to do with the existence or non-existence of any deity than does physics , chemistry , or even plumbing for that matter . They are all equally `` atheistic '' in that they do not deal with supernatural deities . All of the above ( except plumbing ) are investigations of natural phenomena . Science does not study the supernatural because it can not . It lacks the necessary tools to do so . And until you can quantify your god for us , it will remain that way . And of course , anyone who does n't lack the integrity to learn at least the basics of what they are arguing against before arguing knows that evolutionary theory does n't deal with how life , the earth , the universe , or whatever , arose . It seems that you did n't understand the explanations that were offered in this very thread . Evolution deals with how and why heritable chanages in life occur . Evolution deals with heritable changes in populations of organisms . If there are no organisms , then there is no evolution .
I think you confused yourself . You more supported my argument than hurt it .
And what mechanisms are you specifically saying are futile ?
What is astounding about it ? If we had been aborted , we would n't have known anything about it . Untold billions of conceptions have been spontaneously aborted . Do you shed tears for those , too ?
We did and so far no answer . The maximum effective range of an excuse is zero meters .
You twisted logic strikes again . I realise that if a group of you were to take your guns and rise up against the current administration , you would all be labelled terrorists . This is not evidence that I support the current regime . How you could twist it to seem so is beyond me . If I were to state that you could n't take on a fully grown polar bear with just a short pointy stick , would that mean I am supporting the oppressive rule of polar bears ? I think you should sit down and carefully think out what you infer from other 's arguments before you keep coming out with these ludicrous statements .
While that is true , teaching ID is just filling them with horrible thinking skills . ID in one sentence is `` we do n't know how it was done , and it seems too complicated to explain now , therefore God did it . '' Do you really want kids to learn that kind of retarded thinking ?
The fear of God ? What God ? Only yours or any God ? How about the fear of something greater than yourself ? Would that be progress ? I 'm not trying to inform you or anyone else of anything at this time . I posted thread originally to get reactions to it so that I could better judge whether those views were valid or not . As a side affect people may be influenced by the debates that happen here , but I am doing this for myself more than I am for anyone else . So do n't think I 'm trying to push anyone to believe anything , although I do wish for people to question their own views as a way to best understand what they believe in and why they believe it . Based on the way you posted here , it is my guess you are unwilling to do that in the case presented here .
Sure . This is the `` norm '' that we have . But really , these rules are open to change by either of you . You should decide how you want to be `` judged '' . Since this is a formal debate - one should stay clear of all the classical logical fallacies . They actually contain the majority of rules and guidelines for a successful argument . A decent list of them is compiled here : http : //www.infidels.org/news/atheism/logic.html Using proper English and capitalization is just another novelty of formal debate . Although I personally think that it strengthens one 's argument - I 'm quite sure that the content speaks for itself . Insults and personal attacks should have no place in debate . It is always possible to separate one from their argument . Attack the argument and not the person . Again - that is just one of the logical fallacies . As for advice and other guidelines of a strong argument , I strongly suggest this website : http : //www.kings.edu/debate/Judges/N ... ternhagen.html It gives general tips and the like for debates . Also , regarding length . Length of posts is often required and over-simplifying can be a great error . The other extreme - over-complicating will not add much to debate . Once the debate is over ( you decide how many posts each ) then I could , if you want , outline a winner and provide my reasons for thinking so .
Pretty much every experiment ever carried out in a petri-dish ; take your pick Also the revisited peppered moth experiment I linked to earlier .
** Like chemist and all other darwinists , you imply wherever possible . But in this case I broke my own best rule and replied to chemist , and was not speaking of you at all . And you are right , the phenomenon of revertant mutation in eusocial bacteria colonies , [ inexplicable in darwinist mechanical terms ] , as discovered by Cairns , et al , in 1988 , is a separate phenomenon from stress-stimulated somatic hyper-mutation . I misled you in the the quote you used to bring in the Cairns work -- `` Under these circumstances [ stress-induced hyper-mutation ] , as per EAM , [ above ] , it has been repeatedly demonstrated [ since 1988 , at Corning , by that scientist whose name escapes me ] that the number of adaptive mutations outnumbers the number of of ineffectual or maladaptive mutations by a strongly significant statistical percentage . '' That was not Cairns , but Barry G. Hall to whom I was referring , and he was a research prof at U. Rochester in the 90 's who did work on adaptive mutation , wrt adaptive cellular responses in stressed eusocial bacteria colonies . That is , somatic hypermutation as a cellular , [ in multi-cellular organisms , such as eubacteria colonies ] , adaptive , systemic and systematic [ non-randon , non-stochastic , non-accidental ] heuristic evolutionary mechanism . He found that adaptive genetic mutations arising systematically under these circumstances outnumbered maladaptive and inconsequential mutations to a high degree , statistically speaking . A most significant finding , and one that has been repeated again and again and again , to the point where somatic hypermutation is accepted by bacteriologists as a legitimate 'immune response ' enabling rapid adaptive [ EAM ] evolution [ antibiotic resistance ] in eusocial bacteria .
The abortion issue is one that rightwingers use to threaten women and keep them `` in their place . ''
That 's not what he said . Why do you find it necessary to lie ? But of course , you are quoting a news story . I have had experience with news stories that purport to quote what someone has said .
Of course not . That battle has already been lost . Creationism is religion and it can not be taught in a science class , even when it is called `` creation science '' and the data is distorted and mininterpreted . The most recent attempt by creationists in Kansas on the State Board ( and yes , they were YECs ) was to eliminate all requirements to teach evolution , and all references to an old earth from all curriculum standards .
Umm ... thats the point of saying God of the Gaps - when science fills in the gaps then there is less for your God to do .
You realise I 'm talking about if the burglar is running away , not the householder , right ? Looking at it again I realise I may not have phrased it clearly enough . I 'm saying that some of those `` violent '' crimes may simply have been burglars pegging it when disturbed .
Well not exactly . The article addresses some commonality in humans and chimps with regard to altruism exhibited toward chimpanzees who are not known to the chimp exhibiting the behavior . The point was to draw a possible parallel between human altrusim which is known to go beyond mere kinship selection and the chimp behaviors which also appear to go beyond kinship-selection . The discussion goes to the fact that humans and chimps share a common ancestor at the point where humans and chimps went their separate evolutionary pathways . One possibility is that such a common ancestor may have had the capacity to also be altruistic to individuals outside its kinship group . Or of course that chimps and humans both developed their respective altruistic behaviors independently after the branch point . None of this negates the concept of biological altruism in the form of kinship selection which a geneticall based effect . Indeed the article recognizes that chimps DO exhibit kinship selection effects ! There is of course no reason at al that one can not have kinship selection as well as other motivators for altruistic behavior . So its rather premature to take kinship selection ( which I think is what WW means by genetic altruisim ) off the table just yet . The article certainly does not draw the same conclusions as WW would have it do . Once more the rabbit hops over the actual work to his own preferred conclusion . SOP for the lagomorph .
lol ... .With regard to slavery , the Civil War was fought to establish the principle that `` All men ( persons ) are created equal . '' A fetus is a unique and individual person whose location happens to be inside it 's mothers womb . If all persons are created equal , one person does not have the right to descriminate and destroy another person solely because of their location or because they are smaller .
I do n't see a huge difference . The same methodology science used to come up with sonograms and amniocentesis was used to come up with evolution . After all , both sonic imaging and amniocentesis are theories .
Yes . That is one component of evolutionary thought . But there is more to it than that . Another component of evolutionary thought is that many times species remain static ( as far as the fossil record reveals ) for long periods of time , sometimes millions of years . Another component of evolutionary thought is that sometimes speciation can happen relatively rapidly , in a flash of geological time , maybe as little as 50 or 60 thousand years . Even Darwin hypothesized that changes that caused speciation took place in peripheral segments of the population . Just before World War II Dobzhansky and Mayr discussed the gaps in the fossil record and the reasons for them . They agreed with Darwin . Finally , in the 1960s Eldredge and Gould worked out the first statement of what became the theory of punctuated equilibria in which they elaborated on the previous thoughts of Darwin , Dobzhansky , and Mayr . I think their paper , in which they discussed their observations from the fossil record of just such events , was published in 1972 .
And you know this precisely how ? Do you understand just how lovely that first imperfect replicator is to a biologist ? Its our ultimate ancestor . And considering that GOD has on more than one occassion tortured and murdered human kind just how `` beautiful '' can such a being be ?
But who has claimed that it is so ? Certainly not evolutionary biologists . So you are claiming that since birds fly and bumblebees fly that evolutionary biologists claim that birds evolved from bumblefbees ? And since the snout of a Platypus ( you did n't even invest the integrity to learn how to spell that correctly , did you ? ) has a superficial resemblence to a duck , it must be that evolutionary biologists are asserting that the platypus evolved from a duck . I 'm still waiting for an explanation of where you studied evolution , by the way . You assured us that it was a `` detailed '' study . And yet , you display your total ignorance by equating evolution to `` gotten better . ''
The 2020 Global Food Outlook answers this as it says that a greater demand for vegetables will correspond with higher prices of vegetables in developing countries . Many articles acknowledge that starving people can not afford much of any of the food for sale around them , and a greater demand for meat does not necesarily mean a decrease in demand for vegetables as populations grow globally . Since increasing meat consumption is irrational because it will not feed the poor and it will do even more damage to the environment , again , the solution proposed is to support the initiative for developing nations to become more self-sufficient in growing plant foods for themselves .
Because homosexuals are n't attracted to members of the opposite sex , so it 's pointless . In order to have a right , you have to have a legimimate way in which you can exercize that equal right . That 's not possible with hetero-only marriages . There is no special right , it 's equalizing it for biological concerns . Saying homosexuals can get married , but only to heterosexuals is like saying that they HAVE the right , but they have to go against their biological/mental state in order to exercize that . That 's unreasonable . Of course , prior to this debate , Blacks COULD get married , but only proper marriage was between members of the same race . They have the same , equal rights !
And secondly , it 's a bit rich for them to call it murder when a blastocyst can turn into a tumour . And oncologists murder tumours all the time ...

Well I 'm neither rational nor a theist , but still ! I could put in a comment about what I personally believe the nature of God to be , but I 'm sure you 've all heard it before so I wo n't bother ! In the end I do n't think it is an easy question to answer , it is asking to define the undefinable . Humans are limited creatures , we can give a dictionary definition of these things , we have a rough idea of the concept of infinity but can never begin to truly comprehend or define it .

But you know what really does n't make sense ? Why are they evangelising to people ( who they know most of them will reject them ) if those people get a special dispensation ? They 'd be condemning people to hell by evangelizing , would they not ? Why not leave the people be and let them get the special dispensation ?
Do n't be too sure of yourself because he 's said a lot more truthful things in his life than you could hope to say . also your `` science '' is scissors , glue , and tape . no proof of it exists if the earth was millions of years old than there would be no fossils of dinosaurs and people and do n't say preseservative because they do n't last that long ill let you think about that

Yes , but what I meant about the legislature passing it is that the legislature could fund it . If there is funding , it becomes a funded mandate . As I 've said in the past , though , whether it is classified as an `` unfunded mandate '' or not does not suggest that same-sex marriage is wrong or right .
No , we have adapted , but we are not intended to do so . Just look at the soring needs of the elderly . The millions of dollars spent on drugs , just to keep people alive but for what ? Just to need even more drugs as they get older ? That 's not really what I would call natural , but it is the current norm . Civil unions is a copmpromised offer to no recognition . We are saying you ahve the irght to enter the marraige institution but oif you want to enter a different institution this is what we are willing to offer . It 's like saying you have the right to cross the stree at the cross walk . Gays say that crosswalk is n't appealling to me . I want to cross right here . We say fine you can have a cross walk right there but we wo n't put a light to regulate it . Do you have every right to cross at the same cross walk ? Why do you want a different crosswalk because the other one is appealling ? [ /quote ]
And you keep purposefully neglecting to add in the 'selection ' part , which is far from accidental . Your dishonesty and incompetence has not changed since I first encountered you on the old Infidels board so many years ago . You were not so shy about admitting you were a creationist back then . What changed ?
Wow , make up your mind . Either populations change over time ( evolve ) or they do n't . Would your wingless beetles be able to produce wings again if they were somehow beneficial again ? You are starting to sound like Darwin and his finches .
And what is the full quote ? Was it talking about , lets say for example , tutles , where over 90 percent of them die before reaching adulthood ? In many species , that is true . The 'rule of thumb ' is that the more individuals do not reach adulthood , the more offspring that species has .
Say hello to my little friend ! We the people , through our State Governments !

Your stats are n't broken down into meaningful groups , so nothing is learned WRT Muslims .
Because none of these issues were raised in the Heller case ! What 's the matter with people like you ! Your statement is like claiming that the Supreme Court obviously thinks abortion is alright because they did n't address the issue during the Heller case .
Indeed it does . It tells me that we are learning that some genes are more important than others , and that mutations to HOX genes , and other regulatory genes are significant .
No , that 's too niave an approach . We know politicians are going to tell some lies , I trust that 's a given . We , as political consumers , ca n't simply take politicians at their word . If we want to make informed decisions about candidates we need to develop the skills to make useful judgement calls about what they 're saying . We need to figure out how often they lie , what they lie about , how big their lies are . Obviously we should n't need to do this , it would be great if we could actually take our politicians at their word . Bad the sad reality is that we ca n't , not at this stage anyway . In this particular case , if Biden says he does n't support gay marriage I 'm just as likely to think it 's because he knows that open support could cost him the White House as any other reason . It 's sad that such double speak is needed , I 'd love it if enough courageous politicians stood forth and ended the political need for lies , but until that wonderful day I 'm not going to be naive and take everything they say at their word , nor am I going to jump up and down and point fingers at every falsehood . I 'll try to judge the politicians by their actions , and their lies by their magnitude , scope , and quantity .
What does this have to do with nations like England having lower murder rates ? Try to stay on topic .
Quite false . The fossil record shows that life started as `` simple '' single-celled life - bacteria - about 3.5 billion years ago . More complex multicellular life did not appear in the fossil record for nearly 2.5 billion years . And then what we find are only very simple multicellular life forms , such as the simple bilaterian Vernanimalcula about 580 to 600 million years ago . A few million years later in the fossil record we find more complex organisms , like trilobites , but nothing complex like a reptile , bird , or mammal . Later we find jawless fishes making their appearance , followed by jawed fishes , then amphibians , then reptiles , then transitional forms leading from reptiles to mammals , then primates , and then humans .
Oh , OK then .
Well , sort of . It is n't necessary , but if you 're predicting intelligence from what someone does rather than direct measurements of physical properties , knowing their motivation level might allow you to make more accurate predictions . Nevertheless even without knowing the subjects ' motivations at all , today 's generic intelligence tests still have excellent predictive power for success in both school and employment , and are perhaps better predictors for future success than any other method we have ( including interviews , personality inventories , aptitude in a particular field )
And your final statement pretty much sums everything up . That 's the way YOU see it . Moral relativism , as I understand it , does not imply multiple truths . The concept is simply that morals are not absolute truths , but rather perspectives , as you suggest . Consider your example of killing another individual ... You believe it is wrong no matter what , but it may be a necessary evil . Some people would argue that killing another human being would be a morally good thing to do in certain circumstances . Other people would argue that killing people is not inherently 'right ' or 'wrong . ' Whose to say that your assertion is any better than anyone else 's ? Where do we find a universal truth that says , `` Killing another individual is always wrong ... no exceptions '' ? The absolute truth in this situation is that if you kill another individual , then that individual is physically dead . They are no longer living and breathing . That 's fact . That 's truth . By definition . Any assignment of value to the act of killing is opinion . Perhaps many people share your opinion , but it is still opinion . Peace , TheBootfitter P.S . I 'm curious about your handle ... is that a typo ? Or does 'relient ' have some significance of which I am unaware .
Well on this one , I will just say : read jitobears responce .
I 've always disliked this line of logic because it implies that the value of somebody 's life depends on their relative accomplishments and it invites the counter argument that the unborn in question could also become a criminal . Indeed , it has been argued that abortion has reduced crime , poverty , overpopulation and the depletion of natural resources .
Well , if you said `` Look what I found , is n't that disgusting ?

This is retarded . A species would be defined by the genome , not which organs work the way they are supposed to or not .
I have yet to see any conclusive evidence that this is true and undeniable . You wan na prove in an undeniable manner that developed nations around the world have fewer deaths than America ? Then get cracking and gather the evidence . Start proving that the various governments around the world are n't lying about their annual death rates . The UK has been found guilty of continuously altering statistics to make themselves look safer than they really are . So do you have any proof that the annual number of deaths of a country like Germany , are the true number and not some government sponsored , people 's friendly statement to make people feel less afraid ?
YEC really si n't an issue here . Here is a link to what everybody is up in arms about , the proposed chanegs to the KS BOE science standards : http : //www.kansasscience2005.com/Pro ... Sci % 20Stds.pdf They are not talking about actually teaching creationism in the classroom , nor is there actually any discussion about not teaching evolution . What they want is to write into state guidelines requirements that kids have to be told that there are other theories out there , and there are holes in the theory of evolution . Personally , I see no problem with this , and it has more or less been our unofficial policy for years around here . There are holes in the theory of evolution , and there are segments of it that are mostly conjecture . It is in no way as foolish as the YEC theory , or even the strict creationist theory , but there are certianly hole in the theory . We may fill them in the future , but for now , we just have conjecture to fill those holes . All they are really pressing for is basically for kids parents to tell their kids AT HOME that god guided evolution without it contrasting directly with what the kids are being taught at school . Personally , I see no problem with this , as long as they stick to the facts in any case . Just glanmcing over the proposed changes , I am not seeing anything that is factually incorrect . The problem is that you have wack jobs and zealots on both sides of the issue . On the one hand , you have the YEC/creationist crowd . Some fo them go off the deep end when you suggest anything but a literal interpetationof Genisis . On the other side , you have the evolutionaist crowd , who predict gloom and doom and a return to the middle ages every time you suggest that we leave some opening for kids parents to attach religous connotation to the issue . The evolutionist zealots are essentially pushig to remove any possible religous connotation from evolutionary teaching . The YEC folks want to remove any reference to science from the debate . Normal folks , people who are not just trying to **** on somebody elses religon or force their religon down somebody elses throat seem to be pushing for a secular and neutral classroom . This is not an unobtainable goal . In truth , we could put everything we absolutly know about evolution ( have physical proof for ) in a box , and it would be a small one . A large part of th theory is conjecture . Teach the kids what is conjecture and what is not . This just makes good sense . Teach it how it is , not how you wish it was . How many hundreds of years have we lost in scientific development because people failed to experiment into areas that were believed to be known ? How long idd the theory of spontaneus generation hold prevelance before somebody actually challenged it scientifically ? Nobody is suggesting that creationism be pushed in our classrooms . Nobody is even suggesitng that evolution NOT be taught . They are suggesting that evolution be taught acuratly . They want the kids to understand that the theory of evolution certainly has a wide body of evidence behind it , but it also has a substantial amount of conjecture tacked on . While most of the commonly held conjecture certainly fits the evidence at hand , there may be other explanations , explanations we have not even thought of yet , that also fit the evidence . One example is the section about the primordial soup theory . Do we actually have any evidence for the existance of `` primordial soup '' ? Have we found fossilized soup ? Have we ever managed to create such a soup in a lab ? Have we ever seen an example of life emerging from a sterile , lifeless environment ? Is there really a difference between this and the theory of spontaneus generation ? It is just as likely that an alien from uranus landed on premoridalearth , took a dump , and we are all decended from an intergallactic tapeworm . BUT , kansas BOA standards currently have people teaching the primordial soup theiry as if it was proven . It is not . It is baseless conjecture . In fact , it is in contrast to generally accepted biological rules ( life does NOT come from nonliving matter ) . Persoanlly , I think both sides are wrong . I think that the evolutionists have fallen prey to the arrogance of the soft sciences . In striving to understand something , they have taken a relatively small body of evidence , made up a big story around it , and told themselves `` we know it all now '' rather than accepting that their explanation may not be entirely correct . the evolutionists ont he other hand ( YECs anyway ) ... .well , that one is a no brainer . I personally can not find fault witht he intelligent design folks who feel that god guided evolution , since to disprove this you essentially have to disprove the existance of god , and nobody has ever managed to do so ( though the concept of an invisible man in the sky is a little silly ) .
Well , I 'm basing it first and formost on the states which passed ammendments banning same-sex marriage . The percentages in those states were almost completely lower than 80 % , with perhaps one or two exceptions . This indicates that even in the least supportive states , 80 % is usually too high a number . Unfortunately , I can not come up with a good website that lists all of the percentages , but you should be able to look around . This was the least important thing I wrote in that entire post , so I 'm not too worried about it .
So ? The majority of most people are n't criminals , and follow most laws . How is this different ?
Well I ca n't agree to that , the 'evidence ' for ID was all over the place before Darwin came up with a naturalistic solution . Evidence sufficient for proof does not exist but inferential evidence does exist anytime you observe biology . I made a point a while ago about semantics , it was countered as a point mattering to evolution by pointing out it was just semantics which I quite agree with . The point still stands that people can hardly speak about biology without using words like 'designed for ' and 'because ' implying purpose . You do n't hear things like that about geology and chemistry for a reason , they are not complex functioning systems which fulfill a purpose . The surprising part would be if systems fulfill a purpose without being formed by purpose .
So , the news is now out on how the Mexican drug cartels are smuggling in weaponry from Central America and across the sea , how they 're getting stuff that 's been left over from wars long fought , and even how they 're getting ahold of fully functional grenades , rocket launchers , and 40mm cannons . Show me one gun store along the border that 's selling 40mm cannons to the public . Go ahead , show me the stores where these things are freely available and the FFL dealers are boldly flaunting the NFA and GCA laws as if they were misdemeanor offenses like jaywalking .
Count me as one of those 14 % since he has n't demonstrated anything of the sort . And it is n't imposing our religion on anyone at all just because we rely on scriptural values in determining what is right and wrong in life . This is the greatest corruption of common sense that can be revealed regarding how the humanist thinks . What better way to erase scriptural based morality from the public debate than to assert that just by holding to a biblical value system in life is to impose ones religion on the atheist ? This is the goal and defines the agenda of the atheist as it proves that at every level of public discourse it is their goal to claim that any spiritually based value system which opposes secular humanism , opposes the Constitution which could n't be further from the original intent of the Constitution if it tried . The constitution was neither anti-bible or anti-christian . Nor was it anti-spiritual interpretation or application of the laws of the land which is evident by those very laws which exist and compliment spiritual values of christian americans throughout our history . So your not very interesting opinion piece by these so called intellectuals fail on all counts as they must pervert and corrupt what has always been accepted values in this Country in order to reinterpret history if they hope to succeed in this application .
this is not true . the intangible , such as time , ideas and emotions , are just as real to atheists as anybody else . atheists dont subscribe to a spiritual realm , but that doesnt mean they dont agree on the existence of the non-physical . there is a difference
Well , where else is the information going to come from ? Nobody else cares about the creation vs. evolution debate except for creationists and evolutionists .
And with natural selection ? Are you trying to get us to accept your conclusions without providing evidence for your premises ? It does n't work .
So you think he 's really an atheist ? No , you disagree with him on technicalities of your religion , which you 'd do with billions of other Christians . Are they all phonies , too ? ETA : Wow , Collin had some damn good points , especially PZ 's chiding and JPII . Well done , Collin .
Because you 've presented no credible evidence to support the claims that private transactions are an established and major source of firearms for criminals . If you ca n't prove it 's broken , you do n't have grounds to call for fixing it .
On the contrary , anyone who takes an interest in such things is well placed to appreciate just how hard it is to grasp such distances .
You then cite the Wikipedia entry on Spencer :
Which thing are you now focusing on ? My God ? All theories relating to a god ? God being knowable or not ?

Start with the largest most powerful calibur you can get and physically handle . Then consider : Practice = lots of ammo . Lots of ammo = cost increase with larger calibur . Practice = responsible gun owner . Training = responsible gun owner . Large calibur = ability to stop the attack quickly . Small calibur = less likely to exit your target and hit someone behind it . Well placed shots from a small calibur are superior to a large calibur that missed . As a bare minium take a training course that teaches you to handle low light conditions and drawing from a concealed holster . When you need it most are under conditions most favored by criminals , e.g . from behind , up close , in the dark , with suprise , or any combinations of them . A good instructor will also inform you of all the legal implications of having to defend yourself , the implications of comming to the aid of other people , the legal implications of defense on public and private property , etc . Personally I have made the decision that I WILL NOT help anyone in mortal danger whom I do not know . The legal implications if you are wrong are very drastic . You can never know the complete conditions of strangers and how they got to be in mortal danger , for all you know the person who just pulled out a gun may be an undercover cop . Thus I will only come to the aid for friends and family whom I know and thier business . My personal decision . The guys at the gun store are interested with selling you a pistol with the highest profit margin . Not the best tool for you . Only way to find out is with trigger time and carry time on the pistol . So you may have to horse trade a few times until you find the right one . My personal opinion ? A very small .38 revolver with more than one holster . Sometimes you need to carry it on your ankle , sometimes in your pocket , or sometimes on your hip . Plus a ton of ammo for practice . The ammo you spend on practice can soon cost more than the pistol . Los of inexpensive , reliable , and well built .38 's . Not a lot of fun to shoot , but hey , this is a tool with a very specific purpose . Of course of you can deal with more , by all means upgrade to more . Your not going to place a sniper shot between the eyes of a felon . Most likely you will need it at night , very quickly , and at a little longer than `` knife fighting distances '' . I use a .45 auto . I shoot a full size .45 for fun . Train with the full size .45 , but I carry a compact .45 . The compact has exactly the same shape in my hand as the large .45 , thus when I have to go the the small .45 quickly , it will retain the same operation and configuration in my hand as the large .45 . The large .45 has more fun factor , not a lot of fun to carry a big piece of steel on your hip all day . Plus I reload the .45 empties . The cost of a large calibur with reloading becomes as much as a smaller calibur when the ammo is store bought . The time spent reloading keeps me out of bars on week nights and my girlfriend more comforted . By the end of the day , after carrying even the compact .45 . I wish I had a small .38 . The most effecient solution I have seen was a friend who both had a .357 magnum and .22 of the same pistol . He practiced with the .22 pistol all he wanted and very cheaply . Shot the .357 magnum just enough to practice with the recoil . The .22 and .357 had exactly the same size , shape , and trigger pull . My $ .02

I say , since there are medical uses for the stuff , the drug is not pure harm ( as the authoritarians assert . ) Marijuana has its benefits and harms , and some of these benefits boil down to a matter of personal preference . Illegalizing it , in effect , dictates a personal preference .
What is a 'higher ' species . If you mean a more intelligent primate ? ? The concept there is a hierarchy of 'higher ' and 'lower ' species is incorrect . The only difference between man and the other primates is that man has a hyperdeveloped brain . There are two sugars that are naturally produced by body by most mammals . When investingating the presnece of these chemicals , one of them is present in much lower concentrations in the brains of all mammals . However , humans have a mutation that interrupted the production of this chemical . A piece of random junk got inserted into the middle of the gene that produces this chemical , and disabled it . Sometimes , evolution is not so much about what is added , but what is removed .
Bonus question : ( Can you spot the grammatical error within the quoted text ? )
If you have evidence for something , what purpose is faith with respect to that thing ? Faith is belief with no evidence . Or from the dictionary : Belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence . If you verify something scientifically then is it even possible to believe it by faith ?
Like the docking simulation , in development there is a pre-existing fitness landscape ( the womb ) . Both processes converge on similar endpoints each time it is run , both process are biased to a few endpoints and both processes reach local optima ( e.g . skin cells ) after the process id complete . http : //mybroadband.co.za/vb/picture ... .pictureid=1857 Figure 1 : Similarities between development and a docking simulation employing a memetic algorithm . There are certainly many parallels between our own designed simulated docking runs and the development of life .
Were they assigned the ultimate task of interpreting the Constitution and determining which laws violate it ? If not then their opinion does n't matter .
Terrible logic . The first problem is , 99 % of the people who truly love Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior are not rapists , murderers , etc . The second problem is , God loving a person and that person going to Heaven are completely different things . It 's God 's love that allows you to go to Heaven . Crim-
Would n't it have been better to educate yourself in the science you seem to oppose before you asked the questions ?
You consider the county to be like Rosa Parks ? ? ?
Sure . The outcome of Heller vs DC and Florida Shall - Issue laws support that statement . According to Brady logic , the more helpless you are , the safer you are from criminals .
Following the original purpose of this thread , I will summarize my own views on abortion . ( Note , this is copied from an older survey on abortion beliefs - a thread in the abortion forum called `` Survey of views on abortion '' ) : For me , the question of abortion rights comes down to a balance between the rights of the mother and the rights of the fetus . On the side of the rights of the mother , there is a very important right to the control over one 's own body and to not be forced to carry something as important and taxing as a pregnancy against one 's will . Some may say that , in agreeing to have sex , a woman is agreeing to a pregnancy , but I strongly disagree . A pregnancy is a possible outcome of sex but only has a very small percentage chance if birth control is used . It would be like saying that you agree to be mugged if you walk in a bad neighborhood . The great majority of sex acts - for both married and unmarried women , religious or non-religious , conservative or liberal - are not done for the purposes of having children but are done for emotional and/or purely physical reasons . Pregnancy is the goal for only a minority of sex acts . So , women are not agreeing to a pregnancy when they have sex . In the case of unwanted pregnancies , it is a significant burden that they never agreed to . If they are forced to carry such a pregnancy , it would be a strong imposition against the rights over their own bodies . On the other hand , one has the rights of the fetus . What rights the fetus has depends on your belief system and priorities . For me , the most important thing when it comes to the rights of any human being is whether or not there is a mental existence - at least a rudimentary mind . I believe that I did not exist until I started to mentally exist and that applies to all others . My view is that , once a mental existence begins , the right to life of a fetus kicks in and takes priority over the mother 's rights over her own body , under most circumstances . The neurological view is that a mind can not exist before the third trimester . Therefore , I would allow abortion-on-demand for the first and second trimester and restrict it in the third trimester . For that third trimester , I would limit abortions to those that are done to mitigate a significant risk to the mother 's life or physical or mental health ( ex . leading to , say , paralysis or strong possibility of suicide , etc . ) and , in case of severe incurable deformations of the fetus discovered late , to end the life of a fetus that would otherwise strongly suffer ( i.e . mercy killing ) . Otherwise , I believe abortions should be restricted . If a woman has not decided on an abortion by the third trimester , she should have to carry the pregnancy to term ( minus the perviously mentioned exceptions ) . She would have had ample time to decide . Lastly , here are a couple of links which describe the neurological view of a mind not existing before the third trimester : Part 4 of http : //www.2think.org/abortion.shtml http : //7e.devbio.com/article.php ? ch=21 & amp ; id=162
you mistake one hominid for another and cite the words of a known fraud on the piltdown man instead of the other hominid . What is amusing is that you ca n't post on another thread . No creationists has yet argued for the flood mind you .
Well right there , you used an oxymoron , `` Great '' and `` Evangelist '' got together about as well as Military Inteligence . Secondly , as I stated before ... you left too many other questions unanswered about the `` Preacher . ''
Oh he wo n't read that ... This American in exile ( does not even live here anymore ) just disappears for a while whe the heat is on only to resurface with his same propaganda after the heat has died down .
Just like in memetic algorithms , there are many paths to an endpoint . Both memetic algorithms in development and in the docking simulation converge on similar endpoints each time it is rerun . ( e.g . skin in development ) .
You either did not read my post thoroughly , or are intentional misrepresenting me . Post 250 ( which I had actually read before starting this thread ) is nothing but DamEtel rambling about homologies between vertebrae embryos . That has absolutely nothing to do with the unexplained homologies that the Denton talks about . Evolution simply can not , reasonably speaking , account for the homology between your arm and leg , among other examples .
So your answer to the question then is `` Nothing '' , Marc ?
Wow ehat a brave new world you live in ... . Now lets say just 1 % of all gun owners resisted ( in the us that is several hundred thousand peppered through the land ) . With media attention to such infighting between government and citizens how do you deal with this ?
I 'm always honest ! It would become a completely atheist planet in no time - what makes the earth different is Christ 's teaching and actions while he was here , and the following ACTS of those who witnessed it . His Disciples ( mainly Peter ) were scared little rabbits while he was alive , and after his resurection , were n't afraid of anything . That historical fact and other similar ones have had quite an impact for Christianity . The debate about whether God exists or not is n't only about the origin/science debates .
And of course , the theory of gravity is n't `` physically '' proven either . Neither is the heliocentric theory or atomic theory or the germ theory of disease . However , evolution has been observed to occur and the current theories are the best explanations that we have for the observations . As far as your mangling of the `` Out of Africa '' theory , it would be nice if you actually learned what you are talking about before you babble such nonsense .
We are saying the same thing .
I think you should teach everything about pregnancy and sex . The problem comes in when no one takes your seriously . Abortion allows for a no consequence view on sex . It 's like teaching the dangers of steroids in baseball yet the consequence is to take a 1 day class on substantive abuse if you get caught . Of course the rewards are much better . Same thing with attitude towards sex . If you have that fail-safe than the consequences really are n't too bad so preventing pregnancies becomes harder .
There are more people who live together as couples now than say 20 or 30 years ago . If you are a middle aged man and do not realise this then you should get out more..if you are much younger then you can take it from me or google the relevant phrase . Whether there is much difference between now and a couple of years ago ... dont know .
Seems fashionable to smoke marijuana in CA .
Really ? Intra-species evolution and inter-species evolution are one and the same ? *edit* I was reading on micro-evolution in wikipedia , here is what they had to say ... is this incorrect ? `` Typically , observable instances of evolution are examples of microevolution ; for example , bacterial strains that have become resistant to antibiotics . Because microevolution can be observed directly , both pro-evolution and some anti-evolution groups agree that it is a fact of life . ''
Of course .
Good , then you go back to the first point , which is that you can not rationally claim to have knowledge of the unknowable . So yes , you 're back to either being rational and not accepting god , or being irrational and accepting knowledge of the unknowable . I do n't make the rules Jim . -Mach
Amazing how you simply took out the parts of the verse that did n't support your arguement . `` If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him , his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town . They shall say to the elders , `` This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious . He will not obey us . He is a profligate and a drunkard . '' Then all the men of his town shall stone him to death . You must purge the evil from among you . All Israel will hear of it and be afraid . '' Profligate : completely given up to dissipation and licentiousness . Licentiousness : lacking legal or moral restraints ; especially : disregarding sexual restraints
Well , sure there are , and to say that laws based on the Bible do n't exist is to deny reality . You might be surprised to know that around 3/4s of our states have blue laws on their books ( http : //college.hmco.com/history/read ... 0_bluelaws.htm ) , some in `` liberal '' New England ( Massachusetts , Connecticut ) . They 're probably not ever enforced , but they 're there . At one time laws against blaspheming were common . There were laws against swearing in public . Lots of things . Religion and the Bible has long had a profound effect on law in this country .
I believe I stood my ground quite well , otherwise I would n't be posting now .
Again , I did not say that they did not recommend abortion ... they do offer it as an option , but I have never heard of anyone being 'forced ' to have one by Planned Parenthood . All I was disputing was when you said that they ALWAYS recommended it . They do offer pregnancy counseling , along with pregnancy testing . They also offer birth control , gynecological care , STD testing , infertility testing , sexual education counseling , prenatal care , adoption referrals.. etc ... Almost all of these things are offered by my regular doctor , and probably most other doctors as well . They do n't have a maternity ward at Planned Parenthood because they are n't a hospital , and you can go to your own hospital to have an ultrasound done , but if a clinic does an abortion themselves , they have to do an ultrasound first , to determine how far along the pregnancy is , because there are different procedures for different amounts of weeks . If an ob/gyn sees an ultrasound with severe problems , they will sometimes recommend an abortion too . All in all , I just thought that your remark that Planned Parenthood always recommended an abortion was wrong . They also offer services to men too , do you think they recommend abortion to them as well ? ? I have nothing wrong with you being pro-life ... I honestly do n't . I think it 's good that you stand up for what you believe in . But when you make a statement on how a woman is wrong to have an abortion even if her own life is in danger , I find that a little ignorant . I 'm not saying that you are ignorant yourself , but I do n't think you are as well informed on everything as you seem to think you are . And can I ask , are you male ? If you are , you will never , ever be in any type of situation like that , so how can you decide what a woman should do when SHE is faced with a situation ?
And until you realize it is n't hearts and minds that need to be changed to reduce the need for abortion you will fail - regardless of whatever law is passed . Me - as an example - a pregnancy from rape , that is threat to my health or my ability to provide for myself and my child will be ended and any law be damned . Until you can comprehend why that is - you have nothing to say to me . And every women has her unique circumstances and her line in the sand , I assure you .
And an even funnier thing is it wo n't affect his wallet at all .
Neither are yours . *GEE* *gasp* *amazement* *realization* thistownwilleat-

That 's right . It merely has the capacity to make errors which sometimes slightly improves function in a particular environment . And those tend to accumulate over time .
How are we now able to observe the orbit of Pluto , when the orbit of Pluto supposely takes 249 years ? It was only discovered in 1930 . According to your logic , any claims that Pluto orbits the sun is pure speculation and will be until 2179 . By the way , we observe evolution all the time . You see , the threory of evolution has to do with how living organisms change through time , not with how the world came about . We have observed the bacteria evolve to become resistant to antibiotics all the time . It is becoming a real problem in that there are some bacteria that are immune to almost every antibiotic we have .
Well at least in the US you ca n't . Also in the US if a law suit is brought it is normaly not about getting treatment it 's about pain a suffering compensation . In the US if you bring a law suit there is virtualy no risk of having to pay the defendants legal fees if they win so there is no risk to the person or law firm in bringing a suit . This is why frivilous law suits are rampent in the US . Most insurance companies will settle a suit than take it to trial since it costs less to settle .
So you really have no problem whatsoever with belief in God and religion as long as it 's not because someone tells you to ? ? ? You 're seriously drawing a distinction here between ignorant-religion and religion , and the latter is perfectly fine with you ? The fact you say a person ca n't have faith and `` have a backbone and be educated '' gives me every reason to think you DO N'T draw that distinction at all . No offense , but I think you 're just another angry atheist who 's bought into this modern intolerant Hitchens-approach that faith and reason are always juxtaposed . They are n't ; my faith is BECAUSE I 've questioned things , not because I have n't . It 's the conclusion come to from questioning , not the substitute for questioning . And really , it 's rather arrogant and foolish of you to presume to tell me what my faith consists of , as you know more of it than I do . There 's really no good reason for the hostility on your part .
Well there you go , you just opened it up to many different theories . I thought you had focus . But even here you now seem to accept that there are creation accounts that do n't involve the super-natural , which would make them rational , which means your attack on all of them as being irrational was another of your ill-informed attacks .
Well , then our country was founded by `` rednecks '' . ... and who are you to judge the relative value of people ? It 's apparent that you fall into the worthless snob category . I 'll nail the sub-category later .

Stephen Hawkins would have a very good chance of being aborted today . What if Einstein would have been aborted ? What if , what if , what if ... How do we know what would happen at any time whith anyone if they were simply allowed to live and not be killed before they were born ? I do n't know if anyone would want to live if they got a glimpse of heaven . I know I want to go there . But my beliefs do n't allow me to kill myself to get there . Nor do they allow the justification of murder by saying the child is better off .
What makes you think I do n't . Yours is not the only religion on earth ! ! And I did n't just jump to the concluision that your soul needed concern , so do n't jump to it with me .
Tiger is entitled . Because of his money and fame , he 's entitled to some hot and not-so-hot action .
Well , let 's think about that for a moment . The earth 's atmosphere has a mass estimated at 5x10^18 kg , and that 's if we count all of it , right up to the troposphere . Three quarters of a billion cubic miles of water would have a mass of around 3x10^21kg , almost a thousand times greater . So even if the heat from the emerging floodwaters was dissipated into the entire atmosphere , the water would only be cooled by about 0.1 degrees before atmospheric temperatures reached equilibrium and no more cooling could occur .
That and VOR keeps flip flopping on his positions and he refuses to clarify his contridictions .
Oddly enough , the Mass constitution reads : Article XVII . The people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence . And as , in time of peace , armies are dangerous to liberty , they ought not to be maintained without the consent of the legislature ; and the military power shall always be held in an exact subordination to the civil authority , and be governed by it . So apparently they came to their senses later .
I believe that microevolution can not be reasonably disputed . Macroevolution , however , is replete huge gaping holes , disingenuousness and outright fraud I have provided a few links in order to prevent this post from taking the plethora of space it would require and deserves . Anyway here are just some of the problems I have with the way evolution is taught : ORIGIN OF LIFE . Why do textbooks claim that the 1953 Miller-Urey experiment shows how life 's building blocks may have formed on the early Earth -- when conditions on the early Earth were probably nothing like those used in the experiment , and evolution in no way explains the origin of life ? READ MORE DARWIN 'S TREE OF LIFE . Why do n't textbooks discuss the `` Cambrian explosion , '' in which all major animal groups appear together in the fossil record fully formed instead of branching from a common ancestor -- thus contradicting the evolutionary tree of life ? READ MORE HOMOLOGY . Why do textbooks define homology as similarity due to common ancestry , then claim that it is evidence for common ancestry -- a circular argument masquerading as scientific evidence ? READ MORE VERTEBRATE EMBRYOS . Why do textbooks use drawings of similarities in vertebrate embryos as evidence for their common ancestry -- even though biologists have known for over a century that vertebrate embryos are not most similar in their early stages , and the drawings are faked ? READ MORE ARCHAEOPTERYX . Why do textbooks portray this fossil as the missing link between dinosaurs and modern birds -- even though modern birds are probably not descended from it , and its supposed ancestors do not appear until millions of years after it ? READ MORE PEPPERED MOTHS . Why do textbooks use pictures of peppered moths camouflaged on tree trunks as evidence for natural selection -- when biologists have known since the 1980s that the moths do n't normally rest on tree trunks , and all the pictures have been staged ? READ MORE DARWIN 'S FINCHES . Why do textbooks claim that beak changes in Galapagos finches during a severe drought can explain the origin of species by natural selection -- even though the changes were reversed after the drought ended , and no net evolution occurred ? MUTANT FRUIT FLIES . Why do textbooks use fruit flies with an extra pair of wings as evidence that DNA mutations can supply raw materials for evolution -- even though the extra wings have no muscles and these disabled mutants can not survive outside the laboratory ? HUMAN ORIGINS . Why are artists ' drawings of ape-like humans used to justify materialistic claims that we are just animals and our existence is a mere accident -- when fossil experts can not even agree on who our supposed ancestors were or what they looked like ?

I believe its there , but Im certainly no one to push that belief on anyone .
Yes , kind of reminds me of Abraham Lincoln 's thought : `` Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt . ''
And Atilla 's army of as many as 1/2 million men was beaten and forced into retreat by the Romans and Visigoths in 451AD . A year later , he was forced to make peace after devastating the Roman countryside ... but NOT Rome itself . He died a year later in 453AD .
In what country ?
The day you became a person is the first day of you life that you can remember . Sure babies are cute and all but they are not aware , no more a person then a puppy is .
If you have a problem with the answers , then do n't bother to ask .
A fairly good explanation , toned down a bit from Darwin 's explanation ( for the average person who does not have a PHD in biology ) .
Did you get another cracker polly ?
Since the last statement is n't true , I ca n't see how it equates to arrogance .
In point of fact , the low birth rate in most of Europe is not due to the availablity of abortion , but to good sex education and the ready availablity of effective contraception to everyone who needs it . See this study , for instance : http : //www.advocatesforyouth.org/PUB ... heet/fsest.htm People have small families because they want small families . In point of fact , the abortion rate in Europe is generally much lower than the rate in the US , due , again , to education and contraception . Would you force folks to have children they do n't want ?
Chloe , the point of this thread is to help you understand what the argument is , not to give analogies to abortion .
Well , parts break and it could take a long time to order or be repaired . If you got the bucks , I think two would be a better choice .
And amusingly enough , you who claim you do n't have any interest in changing the outcome spend soooo much time posting on these threads ... Perhaps that 's another claim that 's just false in your opinion ?
How do you know that this is n't the case ? And , speaking of unchanging , take a look at this . What I am saying is : a ) We do n't have any evidence ( except the bible 's word ) for the authenticity of the bible . Take a look at my signature . b ) The bible may not change , but human society does . I would be more likely to believe the bible if it did n't make claims of ( scientifically ) impossible things , like a worldwide flood or an omnipotent god .

And those who attempt your resolve or curing or denial gernally end up miserable and suicidal . And does anyone else find the bolded a little bit 3rd Reichish ? What exactly do you mean by `` dealing with homosexuals '' - what is implied here ? What are you suggesting ?
Incorrect . Evolution is not something that must be adhered to . It is a scientific theory . As such , if evidence was brought to light that evolutionary theory could n't account for , then the theory would be altered or scrapped . It 's really quite simple .
I see !
I believe it to be the case that marriage existed prior to any legal recognition of the relationship . If this is true , it seems reasonable to conclude that the state , for whatever reasons , wanted to encourage that particular relationship . Now , if it did so in order to foster an atmosphere where family life can best be nurtured and brought to maturity , that 's well and good . But I still disagree with your conclusion that `` there 's nothing about building a life together that requires the participants to be of differing genders . '' As a general proposition , I agree with this . Two individuals can certainly build a life together without any encouragement from the state . However , in a strict legal sense , there certainly are requirements one must fulfill in order to receive the benefits the state wishes to confer . In other words , legislatures have determined not only that they want to foster and encourage an atmosphere conducive for family life , they have determined that the best way to accomplish this is by encouraging the relationship to be between two individuals of the opposite sex . Now , I will probably say this more than once so that I ensure it has been taken into account : my primary purpose in starting this thread ( and my other posts ) is not WHETHER the definition of marriage should be changed , but if it is to be changed , WHO should change it .
I find the neo-marxist approach to political science interesting and useful . Largely because it accuratly describes and accounts for certain important underlying structures of our contemporary world . It is also flecxible enough to apply to more than just issues concerning economic classes . I find marxist approach to economics interesting from a historic point of view , but not that useful . Basicly that is because many of the assumptions and predictions marxism made has since been falsefied and I have yet to see any rendition of the theories of old into anything useful . I find Communism , as a state-less utopia based on solidarity and community , void of property ownership and class conflict a beutiful idea . But I don`t think it can be achieved through pursuing the socialistic state of pure governmental ownership of the means of production . In fact , I`m quite sceptic that it ever can be achieved ( regardless of how you pursue it ) I find the stalinist and maoist attempts to interpret marxism and apply it to the real world one of the largest attrocities commited throughout modern history . Not only to the hundreds of thousands in the Gulabs and chinese prisons or the millions of victims of starvation or political violence , but also to all of those who actually believed in the proletarian revulotion and where sourly dissapointed when they found themselves slavering in the iron-mines i Kaukasus or working in the rice-fields with a gun-barrel as the only motivation for working harder . I find Socialism , as a practice of democratic ownership of means of production and re-distribution of resources from the more productive or wealthy to the less productive and poor as a good tool to build a succesful society . But as with any tool , it shouldn`t be used in every situation , but only when and where appropriate . When using the tool of socialism , you are most often distorting the effects of the other tools of market forces . This needs to be considered as the market forces have one important attribute , efficiency . There`s a summarise of my oppinions and reasons for having them . How do you feel about marxism , socialism and communism , and why ?
You can have Russia and China , but Hitler was very much a `` christian . ''
State-level governments are largely worthless , in my opinion . It is complete absurdity to allow Constitutions to be ammended based on the vote of the people . People as a whole are largely biased , uninformed , and care only about the wellbeing of the majority , persecuting the minority any chance they get . Simply put , the will of the people is too often to benefit the majority and persecute the minority , and this can be seen everywhere throughout history . The will of the people often deserves to be not only ignored but put in a little can and crushed , for the voice of the people is not the voice of the people at all ; it is the voice of the majority . I can not know the intentions of the creators of the California goverment when they created their judicial system , but if it was anything like the intentions of the founders of our nation , then the judges are doing precisely what it was intended to do : judge laws which persecute the minority , assuring that the government can not engage in such persecution without a whole lot of effort and not having to fear retaliation . If the point of judges was simply to give in to whatever pesecution 51 % of the population wishes to force upon the other 49 % , then our government would be tyrannical in no time . You may feel that a bad precedent was set , but I consider it a far worse precedent for a judge to have given into the majority , to ignore what he feels is a destruction of freedom and equality , simply because it is popular to do so . I would also recommend that the California Constitution be judged based on the fact that it likely has conflicting statements , for example , it may state that everyone must recieve equal protection under the law , of which this is a clear denial .
It would be interesting to here this college professors explanation of these . There will always be people who do not like your rights , and will go to extended means to slick you out of them !
Thank you for your response .
Leading the parade out of their jurisdiction and title to protect them and failing to report to the agencies actually with title and jurisdiction is n't evidence of complicity ? You are fried .
I am hardly a phyicist , but I am under the impression that there is at least some people who feel there is reason that there are 'uncaused causes ' . I think that the terms used are 'Vacuum flucuations ' , and 'virtual particles ' . I am not aware of any peer reviewed articles on it , but a popular press book is 'Achilles in the quantum world ' by Richard Morris .
I think that 's a good definition . What is a Christian agnostic ? ( Never heard of them . )
Genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene . Once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes ( many are either neutral or even inactivatee ) then of course they are subject to selection . Why do you think otherwise ? Remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations .
But will you listen ?
Again , we never said that a human fetus was a different species .
Unmaking it is n't moving it . And I did n't say `` Move a big rock '' I said `` Break a hard rock . '' In half , that is .
I believe they got XXXXXX at all the conservates on this board . So they went and joined a commie discussion board where they feel more welcome and can send congrats to each other for being smarter than regular people .
Thank the lord you are not a creationist ( pardon the pun ) . The method you referred to above is known as deductive reasoning , and is known to be a very valid way of finding a solution even by most 3rd graders . Also , I look at the Bible as a written record of what actually happened as well as the holy book . Seeing as scientists have believed the journals of young Native Americans from a hundred years ago , I do n't see the problem of believing the written journal of hundreds of very wise men and women , including God himself .
Interesting how the study was set in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . They 're a city known for violence and gang-related issues . I would n't be the least bit surprised if those that were shot and counted in this `` study '' were known gang members who were either shot by their intended victims , or by other rival gang members .
And that is why they are wrong . They do n't understand science . Science is not the presentation of proof but explanations of the evidence that have been tested .
So you 're claiming that you `` transformed '' from part of your mother to a human . So you 're claiming that you were once almost your mom 's arm or leg ? lol ! Biologically , this is simply a farce statement .

I am not sure Marc will show up here much . I noticed he is at 'debating christianity ' and is a '4forums refugee ' , where he had 10 people jumping on him at once .
And that 's why I think you are a troll . There really are n't any experts here . There are several who are knowledgable in a variety of topics , but that knowledge seems to me to be the result of being both educated and widely read . It also indicates an ability to reason and an open mind .

I did not say that evolution precludes God , all I am saying is that many Atheists seem to think it does , and thus it likely contributes to the number of people who beleive there is no God . If a person does not beleive in God , then they must beleive there is no ultimate morality .
He is concerned that you are taking things to far , Simone .
Just because we interpret the available evidence differently , for you to assume from that , that we believers know nothing about the universe we inhabit is arrogance to the max .
** Here you reveal exactly what I 've just spoken of -- you assume that science and the scientific method equates to , is synonymous with , materialism/mechanism . It most certainly is not . Nor is the accompanying assumption , i.e. , that any science which does not strictly adhere to materialust/mechanist assumptions , is not , and can not be , real science . Equally untrue . Both assertions are unnecessary to an objective approach to science , per se , but are part and parcel of an emotional defence of materialism/mechanism and its biological aspect , RMNS darwinism .
If that was not possible evolution would be impossible , it is direct evidence that evolution is n't impossible not that evolution exists . The same can be said for adaptation , natural selection , and mutation . They are all concepts that evolution stands on but their existance does not necessitate evolutions . For instance if I had the theory : when heavy ceramic objects fall on top of one another a very few super energetic particles fly outwards and cause leaves to fall . I could offer the fact that leaves and bricks do in fact fall , as `` evidence '' for my theory but it would not be in any way that the rising and setting of the sun was not evidence for both rotation and orbit .
Actually the defending of ATF would n't do much with regular guns since they have little to do with them . ATFs function is with NFA guns , which you probably know little , or nothing about .

So , in your scenario , Prototype , are you anti-choice folk going to force us who believe in choice , who believe that a woman owns her very own body , are you going to place us in re-education jails so that we , too , believe that a fertilized egg is a human being ?
Do you have any evidence that this is so ? Why would they be totally useless - is it just because you ca n't imagine a use ? Why do you think that a small , quick dinosaur with relatively long arms ( not like the short useless arms of T. rex that could n't even reach its mouth ) with three very sharp claws would be useless ? Look at this picture . http : //research.amnh.org/vertpaleo/feather18.jpg Those do n't look like totally useless masses to me . The problem is that you imagine that wings sprouted from nothing and must have been useless until they were fully formed as you think they should be . That 's not the case . They did n't spring from nothing as useless masses . They were the front limbs , with quite impressively clawed , grasping hands . They could have even been used for climbing , as is the case of hoatzins that have claws on their wings until they get their primary flight feathers . The could have been used for grasping food that they were able to catch because of the speed assist from imprefectly formed wings . You propose yet another `` I just ca n't imagine how it happened so it must not be true '' creationist argument .
So you 're against the Supreme Court outright ?
This is exactly what I said in a pm to her . I also suggested that she talk to women who have had abortions , who have not , who have had adoptions , and who have been adopted . I wish there was some kind of `` place '' you could go to automatically get this kind of dialogue . Not internet sites , but face to face stuff . Want to start a counseling center ?
Not true . I believe in `` some '' gun control measures . However , I also believe in my right keep and bear arms , and use such arms as I see fit in defense of myself and others . It 's not an all or none thing in my book .
Actually , it 's not . The big bang theory is also science . What exactly do you think the big bang theory is ? What evidence do you think supports it ? What evidence is there against it ? why do you disagree ? What is your education in cosmology - in other words , why is your disagreement rational ?
Because someone has deemed you to be stupid . Never mind that stupid or not , citizens still have rights . Because someone has deemed you to be trivial . You do n't matter enough to have rights or the rights you want are labeled to be trivial . Because your violating those rights of `` someone '' . Though those `` someone '' can not name the right your violating . They are sure your violating something eventhough they can not name it and they hate you for it .
My point was that just because an animal has features that resemble different animals does n't mean it has evolved from them .
This opening paragraph sets the stage for the rest of the article , and on the face of it there would n't seem to be much to disagree with . We all do live on the same earth under the same stars , and we do interpret facts according to axioms .
Excellent point Doc
Sorry , I dont know PAs law or if there is a link to it . Va follows the old common law rules for self defense . From what I have read of the new ( and much criticized by the media elite ) Florida self defense bill , it sounds like Florida is just returning to the old common law standard for justifiable self-defense , where retreat to the wall is not required when faced with a threat of deadly force . The first I heard of the new law change in Fla. was from the misfortune of watching a CBS nightly news story on it . The reporter said with disbelief in his voice ( the kind of my God what are they doing !  panic you hear when someone passes a law they dont like ) that the new law states that if you shoot someone you are actually presumed innocent of any crime . My only comment on this is that the reporter obviously knows nothing of our legal system . Whenever any person is prosecuted for any crime , whether in Fla. or anywhere else in America , that person is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt . I thought about e-mailing our standard jury instruction to the CBS guy : THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT the defendant is presumed innocent . You should not assume the defendant is guilty because he has been indicted and is on trial . This presumption of innocence remains with the defendant throughout the trial and is enough to require you to find the defendant not guilty unless and until the Commonwealth proves each and every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt . This does not require proof beyond all possible doubt , nor is the Commonwealth required to disprove every conceivable circumstance of innocence . However , suspicion or probability of guilt is not enough for a conviction . There is no burden on the defendant to produce any evidence . A reasonable doubt is a doubt based on your sound judgment after a full and impartial consideration of all the evidence in the case . In any event , I have heard the re-tread of the same old arguments again about Fla. becoming the wild , wild west ,  traffic accidents becoming shootouts ,  and Fla. becoming the gunshine state. These are the same arguments which were made when Fla. adopted a concealed carry law . I believe they will prove just as ignorant now as they did then .
Terrible analogy . Thermodynamics is not like a boulder rolling down a mountain .
Just laugh ok , it 's my first attempt at making up a joke lol I guess it would only be funny for an anti-evolutionist , not like yourself . A bit like trying to make a hillbilly laugh at the red-neck jokes or make an Irish man laugh at three men jokes ( Enlishman , Scotsman and Irishman ) .
Yes , I use `` design '' in a teleological sense . I have not contrasted 'design ' with 'evolution ' , however . Only you have done that . And you are still using the word evolution as if it were some kind of causal force . If you keep using the word that way , then it becomes interchangeable with `` Mother Nature '' , or even `` God '' . That just does n't work for me .
Wow , you PROVED the Big Bang to be a big dud ? I didnt see this clear refutation of a longheld scientific theory written up in any of the peer reviewed scientific journals . I must have overlooked it . Can you give the reference to your article ?
Your wrong . Airplanes and courthouses are gun free zones but these places never have massacres .
No proof anyone ever went from gay orientation to straight orientation .

Come on , people . You do n't butcher an innocent baby for the conveience or sins of the parents . There 's plenty of people in the world who would have adopted that baby . And if no one else would have , I would have .
WOW ! Is that English ? Are you sure that you understand the question ? Is this little bit on unintelligible babble supposed to be meaningful ?
They do not differ in any significant way . The living species today closely resemble the fossils . The prediction was made based on the mindset that everything evolved from a common ancestor over billions of years . Furthermore , it was based upon the fossil record , which is supposedly shows how everything evolved .
Humor me . Show me where in the Bible homosexuality is allowable .
I think you and Howard Beale have sorted this out ( thanks Howard ) .
First of all , you are discounting the many people who both believe in God and recognize evolution at the same time . The two are not mutually exclusive ( although unerpaulie has some interesting things to say on that ) . Secondly , evolutionists chanting about `` god of the gaps '' in the way you describe is actually the opposite of what 's going on . It 's the creationists/IDers that are asserting that if a piece or two is still missing from the evolution puzzle , then it must be that God , or an `` intelligent designer '' is responsible . The `` God of the Gaps '' is simply the name that many of us evolutionists that we 've given to this particular argument . And you 're right that the fact that most scientists agree about something does n't constitute proof for it . The proof has to do with why all those scientists agree , and there 's more than enough evidence to account for that . I might add that another thing that absolutely does n't constitute proof is a story in a book written back when we had little to no understanding of how the world works .
And we all know that is what it will become . I 'm willing to bet money that Marc is going to argue that abiogenesis is a part of evolution as well as the big bang . There 's a clear reason why he wo n't accept the definitions before the debate starts .
SNIP This opinion piece was put forth by the Violence Policy Center , the same people who opposed all forms of firearms safety training and gun locks , because they might encourage people to feel that they 're more capable of safely operation a firearm . The Violence Policy Center also pushed the idea of an `` assault weapons ban '' because it was easier than a handgun ban , claiming that the uneducated people are unable to tell what is a machine gun and what is n't a machine gun , making passage of such a law all the easier .
So cross jurisdictional escort is a fairly common occurrence in the area . You will note that it is not the local cops talking about not being informed ... .it is the author of the article whining about it .
I thought I 'd give Brady and Penfold a chance to tell us what a bad man this guy was for defending himself like that . BTW , here in Alaska he did n't need to have a concealed carry permit . Here , if you can legally own a gun you can carry it with a few exceptions . Merry Christmas
I see your point and this goes back to my reply that emotions really show nothing as far as being spiritual .
And here 's an example why our culture has not embraced logic yet . What if your parents had a headache when they were going to have sex and decided not to and you were n't concieved ? Think about all the things you enjoy now , they would 've never happened if your parents had a headache and decided not to have sex . If they did decide to abort me , it would 've been before I existed . You can only legally abort in the first and second trimester , and that was before I existed . `` I '' came to exist somewhere in the third trimester , when I gained mental existance and awareness . Before that , the embryo was just a cellular watersack . Your logic is extremely flawed , more so that most of the pro-lifers on these forums . I would think a bit deeper about your position before coming and posting it onto here .
So even though microstamping is unproven , and the whole idea was proposed by the owner of this technology , it should still be implemented ?
In fact , just the opposite is true . Have you ever read the entire decision ? If you did , you would have a very different conclusion . In point of fact , Roe is a model of judicial restraint . Mr. Justice Blackmun takes great pains to point out in the opening of the majority opinion that there are many competing theories and answers to the metaphysical question of when personhood begins , and that those who hold to each of those positions is quite passionate in its defense . Therefore , the opinion takes great pains to point out , the Court is in no position to choose one from among all the competing theories and stamp it with the government 's imprimatur . Ultimately , the decision points out , the choice must be left where it properly belongs , in the hands of each individual woman . The later term abortions that the decision discusses , which form a minuscule percentage of those performed , were not declared to be illegal or unconstitutional in any way whatsoever . The Court simply said that , in order to protect the health of the woman , the state could prescribe the site of the abortion . Did the decision go far enough ? Not really , in my opinion . I would have wanted the Court to eliminate all restrictions whatsoever and leave the choice strictly up to the woman involved . Given the climate of 1973 , that was ground the Court was not willing to plow .
Actually they do . Whether or not you think they should is another matter entirely . Did you not notice where the article came from ? From a paper in India . I also found articles on the same subject from papers all over the country as well as in other countries such as Romania . Save your snobbery for someone else .

im not saying that my worldview is 100 % provable because i live by faith but my faith is not blind , it makes sense to what we see in the world . However , if one examines the atheists worldview , it has lots of things that it can not account for . All that exist is matter ; do I excuse a rock for tripping me ? They can not account for morals . If morals come from man , then man can change them , if they come from majority consensus , it still begs the question is the majority right ? The majority can change . If we are born with them , I could say , I was born to kill . ( Animals do not have morals why should we ? )
More lies . I mentioned genetics and observed instances of speciation , yes ?
Why would they go away ? Birds still have bird feet . How are they a hinderance ? Have you looked at the feet of tridactyl dinosaurs ? Are you aware that dinosaur tracks were at first thought to be the tracks of large birds ? Would n't `` bird feet '' be beneficial to an animal that lived in trees ?
Oh ? What other darwinists here agree with Symbiote ? http : //www.nmsr.org/nylon.htm My favorite example of a mutation producing new information involves a Japanese bacterium that suffered a frame shift mutation that just happened to allow it to metabolize nylon waste .
Actually , you should n't ask that . If they 're stolen , ( commonly from vehicles , as OC stated ) , well , would one have the leave them in a vehicle if he lives in a state that issues CCWs without having to go through a big legal hassle ? Not really
So the intent hiding behind abortion laws all along was to keep women in the gutter . There was not any legititamte concern for the unborn fetus . It was all about how they could keep women down . Tell me then , would someone who supports a ban on partial birth abortion do so simply because they want to repress women ?
Very sorry for the above confusion , its_just_me is my fiancee and I forgot to log in as myself ( thinking_person ) before writing the above quoted post . Duh . Was n't thinking sorry ( haha )

joke ( P ) Pronunciation Key ( jk ) n. Something said or done to evoke laughter or amusement , especially an amusing story with a punch line . A mischievous trick ; a prank .

And I think it would be good to point out that cannibalism in this context is the eating of human flesh ( not necissarily that of a mentally existant human , just the fact that it contains human cells - the same could be said for eating cloned human cells ) . Otherwise nutjobs like Steeeve , Chloe , and this new SuperSport/EZ clone will start claiming that you have to consider foetuses living human beings for it to be cannibalism , which I am sure they would do .
Even in Gun Free England . Four-year-old girl shot dead in Aldershot -- Mother critically wounded and man , believed to be child 's father , found dead after reports of violent dispute Gang wars made estate a no-go zone for police -- - Area was ridden with guns and crack dealing All horrific and senseless , but Penfold , why did you ONLY post what happened in America ?
You are getting to a more complicated area where `` mental existence '' no longer matters . I 've explained earlier that it is n't exactly the same as `` self defense '' so I do n't think a similiar response is needed . Furthermore , you are saying mental existence is not solely the thing that gives you value but rather it depends on outside influences and chance . At some point it just seems like the stance on abortion is that the woman is more important no matter what . This is why I claim some will rank humans above other humans ... a dangerous precedent which we have tried before .
Well if that is n't what you meant then you should n't have worded it in a way that could be misinterpreted to mean that gun ownership is tied to serving in the military .
But they are implemented completely differently .
It is true about the crusades , the inquisition etc , Those crimes were committed in the name of Christianity . Hitler was going by the book . There are wondeful social effects of Christianity . Evolution has none . Darwin warned against allowing `` the weak members of civilised societies [ to ] propagate their kind '' `` With savages , the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated ; and those that survive commonly exhibit a vigorous state of health . We civilised men , on the other hand , do our utmost to check the process of elimination ; we build asylums for the imbecile , the maimed , and the sick ; we institute poor-laws ; and our medical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one to the last moment . There is reason to believe that vaccination has preserved thousands , who from a weak constitution would formerly have succumbed to small-pox . Thus the weak members of civilised societies propagate their kind . No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man . It is surprising how soon a want of care , or care wrongly directed , leads to the degeneration of a domestic race ; but excepting in the case of man himself , hardly any one is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed . '' ( Darwin , Charles R. [ English naturalist and founder of the modern theory of evolution ] , `` The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex , '' [ 1871 ] , John Murray : London , Second Edition , 1922 , reprint , pp.205-206 ) [ top ] `` Haeckel was the chief apostle of evolution in Germany . Nordenskiold ( 1929 ) argues that he was even more influential than Darwin in convincing the world of the truth of evolution . ... But , as Gasman argues , Haeckel 's greatest influence was , ultimately , in another , tragic direction-national socialism . His evolutionary racism ; his call to the German people for racial purity and unflinching devotion to a `` just '' state ; his belief that harsh , inexorable laws of evolution ruled human civilization and nature alike , conferring upon favored races the right to dominate others ; the irrational mysticism that had always stood in strange communion with his brave words about objective science-all contributed to the rise of Nazism . The Monist League that he had founded and led , though it included a wing of pacifists and leftists , made a comfortable transition to active support for Hitler . '' ( Gould , Stephen J . [ Professor of Zoology and Geology , Harvard University ] , `` Ontogeny and Phylogeny , '' Belknap Press : Cambridge MA , 1977 , pp.77-78 ) .
I believe the question was aimed at those who advocate only the police being armed and nobody else , the ones who believe that only the police have good reason for having access to guns , but no regular person needs a gun for any reason whatsoever .
Yes , they are correct . They are also responsible for the various other things like the recent Minnesota bridge collapse , HurricaneKatrina , and many other things . God is punishing his messed-up nation , trying to get us to move from our moral corruption and perversion .
And yet you have no problem with this law Galileo ?
So you 're in favor of retro-active abortion ?
Again with the common sense , but that is another issue alltogether . You 're arguement that the brain is a fundamental unit of life is just plain wrong , considering the majority of all organisms do n't have one . Bacteria , Protists , Plants , Fungi , and some animals are all without brains . Brains are required for motion and fast response to immediate changes in environment , for example a falling rock . Brains cluster nerves so that appropriate action can be taken . Some brains are amazingly simple while others like our own are immensly complex . Your arguements all show a general lack of study in biology and my common sense is appalled by yours . I am reminded of Bill Maher who once said about the intelligent design debate : `` Because you do n't have to teach both sides of an arguement when one side is retarded . ''
I dont know how the negligence laws apply to First Aid in the states , but in Australia the situation is analogous . You can , as a trained first aider , walk down the street . You see a man with obvious severe injuries , who is screaming out for help . Until you accept the responsibility of helping that man , you have absolutely no duty of care to him . Similarly , until a mother accepts the responsibillity of having a child , she has absolutely no duty of care to it . She can even carry it to term and give it up for adoption .
WOW simone , are you kidding me ? You will use this story as an example of how dangerous giving birth is on this American forum by referring to a story from Sub Saharan Africa ? And you consider this a rational argument ?

How is this an argument which justifies abortions in America where Fistulas is virtually unknown as a result of child birth ? Tell me how this quoted section below applies to any aspect of medical care in the USA . The women filled most of Ward 2 , a long , one-story building with a cement floor and two rows of closely spaced beds against opposite walls . All had suffered from obstructed labor , meaning that their babies were too big or in the wrong position to pass through the birth canal . If prolonged , obstructed labor often kills the baby , which may then soften enough to fit through the pelvis , so that the mother delivers a corpse . Obstructed labor can kill the mother , too , or crush her bladder , uterus and vagina between her pelvic bones and the baby & # 8217 ; s skull . The injured tissue dies , leaving a fistula : a hole that lets urine stream out constantly through the vagina . In some cases , the rectum is damaged and stool leaks out . Some women also have nerve damage in the legs . One of the most striking things about the women in Ward 2 was how small they were . Many stood barely five feet tall , with slight frames and narrow hips , which may have contributed to their problems . Girls not fully grown , or women stunted by malnutrition , often have small pelvises that make them prone to obstructed labor .
There called footnotes The GOA is peppered with them not like the made up XXXX from the brady bunch and other civil rights violators like yourself . Why do n't you try disputing facts than making up stories and childishly trying to copy me . Here lets start with this ... . Please read and explain to me how ( if ) any of these 40 things are wrong Mr . Civil-Rights violator : 1 . Banning guns works , which is why New York , DC , & amp ; Chicago cops need guns . 2 . Washington DC 's low murder rate of 69 per 100,000 is due to strict gun control , and Indianapolis ' high murder rate of 9 per 100,000 is due to the lack of gun control . 3 . Statistics showing high murder rates justify gun control but statistics showing increasing murder rates after gun control are `` just statistics . '' 4 . The Brady Bill and the Assault Weapons Ban , both of which went into effect in 1994 are responsible for the decrease in violent crime rates , which have been declining since 1991 . 5 . We must get rid of guns because a deranged lunatic may go on a shooting spree at any time and anyone who would own a gun out of fear of such a lunatic is paranoid . 6 . The more helpless you are the safer you are from criminals . 7 . An intruder will be incapacitated by tear gas or oven spray , but if shot with a .357 Magnum will get angry and kill you . 8 . A woman raped and strangled is morally superior to a woman with a smoking gun and a dead rapist at her feet . 9 . When confronted by violent criminals , you should `` put up no defense -- give them what they want , or run '' ( Handgun Control Inc. Chairman Pete Shields , Guns Do n't Die - People Do , 1981 , p.125 ) . 10 . The New England Journal of Medicine is filled with expert advice about guns ; just like Guns & amp ; Ammo has some excellent treatises on heart surgery . 11 . One should consult an automotive engineer for safer seatbelts , a civil engineer for a better bridge , a surgeon for internal medicine , a computer programmer for hard drive problems , and Sarah Brady for firearms expertise . 12 . The 2nd Amendment , ratified in 1787 , refers to the National Guard , which was created 130 years later , in 1917 . 13 . The National Guard , federally funded , with bases on federal land , using federally-owned weapons , vehicles , buildings and uniforms , punishing trespassers under federal law , is a `` state '' militia . 14 . These phrases : `` right of the people peaceably to assemble , '' `` right of the people to be secure in their homes , '' `` enumerations herein of certain rights shall not be construed to disparage others retained by the people , '' and `` The powers not delegated herein are reserved to the states respectively , and to the people '' all refer to individuals , but `` the right of the people to keep and bear arm '' refers to the state . 15 . `` The Constitution is strong and will never change . '' But we should ban and seize all guns thereby violating the 2nd , 4th , and 5th Amendments to that Constitution . 16 . Rifles and handguns are n't necessary to national defense ! Of course , the army has hundreds of thousands of them . 17 . Private citizens should n't have handguns , because they are n't `` military weapons '' , but private citizens should n't have `` assault rifles '' , because they are military weapons . 18 . In spite of waiting periods , background checks , finger printing , government forms , etc. , guns today are too readily available , which is responsible for recent school shootings . In the 1940 's , 1950 's and1960 's , anyone could buy guns at hardware stores , army surplus stores , gas stations , variety stores , Sears mail order , no waiting , no background check , no fingerprints , no government forms and there were no school shootings . 19 . The NRA 's attempt to run a `` do n't touch '' campaign about kids handling guns is propaganda , but the anti-gun lobby 's attempt to run a `` do n't touch '' campaign is responsible social activity . 20 . Guns are so complex that special training is necessary to use them properly , and so simple to use that they make murder easy . 21 . A handgun , with up to 4 controls , is far too complex for the typical adult to learn to use , as opposed to an automobile that only has 20 . 22 . Women are just as intelligent and capable as men but a woman with a gun is `` an accident waiting to happen '' and gun makers ' advertisements aimed at women are `` preying on their fears . '' 23 . Ordinary people in the presence of guns turn into slaughtering butchers but revert to normal when the weapon is removed . 24 . Guns cause violence , which is why there are so many mass killings at gun shows . 25 . A majority of the population supports gun control , just like a majority of the population supported owning slaves . 26 . Any self-loading small arm can legitimately be considered to be a `` weapon of mass destruction '' or an `` assault weapon . '' 27 . Most people ca n't be trusted , so we should have laws against guns , which most people will abide by because they can be trusted . 28 . The right of Internet pornographers to exist can not be questioned because it is constitutionally protected by the Bill of Rights , but the use of handguns for self defense is not really protected by the Bill of Rights . 29 . Free speech entitles one to own newspapers , transmitters , computers , and typewriters , but self-defense only justifies bare hands . 30 . The ACLU is good because it uncompromisingly defends certain parts of the Constitution , and the NRA is bad , because it defends other parts of the Constitution . 31 . Charlton Heston , a movie actor as president of the NRA is a cheap lunatic who should be ignored , but Michael Douglas , a movie actor as a representative of Handgun Control , Inc. is an ambassador for peace who is entitled to an audience at the UN arms control summit . 32 . Police operate with backup within groups , which is why they need larger capacity pistol magazines than do `` civilians '' who must face criminals alone and therefore need less ammunition . 33 . We should ban `` Saturday Night Specials '' and other inexpensive guns because it 's not fair that poor people have access to guns too . 34 . Police officers have some special Jedi-like mastery over hand guns that private citizens can never hope to obtain . 35 . Private citizens do n't need a gun for self-protection because the police are there to protect them even though the Supreme Court says the police are not responsible for their protection . 36 . Citizens do n't need to carry a gun for personal protection but police chiefs , who are desk-bound administrators who work in a building filled with cops , need a gun . 37 . `` Assault weapons '' have no purpose other than to kill large numbers of people . The police need assault weapons . You do not . 38 . When Microsoft pressures its distributors to give Microsoft preferential promotion , that 's bad ; but when the Federal government pressures cities to buy guns only from Smith & amp ; Wesson , that 's good . 39 . Trigger locks do not interfere with the ability to use a gun for defensive purposes , which is why you see police officers with one on their duty weapon . 40 . Handgun Control , Inc. says they want to `` keep guns out of the wrong hands . '' Guess what ? You have the wrong hands
Gun control maintains its racist roots even in this day and age . What other reason would there be for Form 4473 to ask applicants what their race is ? What is the importance of knowing if somebody 's white , black or mexican when they 're buying a gun ?
I know . I just do n't want to be accused of only spitting in one direction . Carry on .
Look up the evolution of colour vision in primates . It 's my personal favourite - but what do you think ?
Do you think that being allowed to marry your favorite sheep would undermine the institution of marriage ? How about the ability to marry multiple partners ? Or do you think that nothing is capable of undermining the institution of marriage ? Just trying to gauge your level of sincerity . . And sanity .
Because when something passes every experiment thrown at it and when something fits observation better than anything else , then it 's as near as damnit fact . We can get pedantic over this if you want , but the conclusion that reaches is that there are no facts .
So why is this killing in DC on the news , when so many previous ones were ignored and treated like they did n't exist ?
Problem is , you think requiring a woman not to kill someone is `` treating them as breeding animals '' . Kind of an odd thought .
If the Bible is not scientific and does n't purport to be , why are you here parading it as a book filled with scientific data that is in no way scientifically inaccurate ? That 's quite the dichotomy . Is your faith in its veracity that weak ? Waxy
Well , I do n't believe in evolution . I believe in things for which I have no evidence . And while it is true that everyone has bias , using correct science and the process of peer review works to eliminate . Not all is perfect , and people are people , but overall the system works . Not a lot of bad science gets through . In the case of `` creation science '' we know that there is no science involved . Only talk that sounds scientific . There is no hypothesis , prediction or testing . Only ad hoc stories constructed of selected bits of evidence to support the foregone conclusion .
I think you misunderstand my view . I think that a third-term fetus is already sufficiently a person , so I would CERTAINLY consider a newborn baby a person . To me , a person is one who has the most basic , rudimentary sense of thought and emotion . A late-term fetus , from my point of view , is no less a person than an Einstein . An Einstein , of course , is much more useful to a much greater number of people , but from the simple point of view of whether he is more of a person , I would say not .
You were asked to give us your explanation of evolution . So far you 've just regurgitated creationist arguments against it , without showing that you actually understand what you 're arguing against . But instead of trying to answer the question that was asked of you , you just spat out some more quotes . The least you could have done was to use quotes that explained evolution as you percieve it , but they 're not even on topic , going on about morality and atheism ! You continue to confirm your ignorance for us .
What 's ridiculous is your mis-reading of the argument . I 'm both discussing individual pharmacists , and their refusal of service to individuals based on the drug the individual wants , which is already assumed to be dispensed at that pharmacy or chain .
Well , if they are your own words , .. then it means at least have verbalised it from your self , rather than repeat like a parrot .
But they 're not drunks , are they ?
Lacking substance as usual ... . Whether Jefferson said it or not is not the issue . The topic of this thread is `` 15 myths about gun control '' But you seem unable to make a logical point so you resort to attacking the individual ...

Strange , I was under the impression this article was referring to the Roman Catholic Church .
Well actually , it was supposed to be humorous , as well as putting a point across , not just insulting .
quite easily actually . http : //www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dinosaur/flesh.html You 've already been refuted on this issue before . Typical creationist . make argument , watch it get refuted and bring it back after people have forgotten you already made it .

As is obvious , not all would .
So this means that genes are not related to the traits our body has ? I did n't think so ...
You 're thinking is right on , sinjin . Although it 's kinda hush-hush , it has been determined ( especially in the more charismatic churches ) that when one `` goes further '' in religion the other feels alienated and problems/troubles that probably would have never risen in their relationship oozes out . A new circle of friends emerge which make the one that is & # 8220 ; left behind & # 8221 ; feel closed out and closed off . Arguments then seem to erupt daily and most of it over who is doing the & # 8220 ; right thing & # 8221 ; according to that religion , followed all too often by divorce .
Just on my way out , saw this , and YES ! I have long believed that this is the heart of the matter , and have tried to make this point with little success from time to time . I have never seen a direct response to this . Ever . Even in threads where the discussion has carried on in detail on both sides , this concept is totally ignored . There was a similar , brief hiatus leaning towards this point in one of the threads over at IIDB where creationist spammer Afdave is rapidly losing his dignity and proving himself predictably ignorant in all fields of science including the philosophy of same . It got really interesting for a bit and the guys over there looked to have actually got through to him for a bit , but then he predictably went into full Gish Gallop mode in order to bury his own cognitive dissonances underneath wave upon wave of standard AiG/EvoFairytale strawmen . Just my two pence ; this is a fascinating psychological point that should be discussed .
No problem . I personally believe killing innocent children is wrong . Yet , I also believe that a woman 's decision to murder her child is between her and her god . I would n't remove individual choice . It 's not mine to make . But this is n't the right forum for that . Back to the OP : False dichotomy , or obfuscation and refusal to answer the stated question ?
Because the effectiveness of other methods do n't come close to that of owning a gun for personal protection . If they did then the police would n't have guns because it would be redundant and not cost effective .
Yes . Scientific theories do n't deal with God .
Armour piercing ammo , 100 % legal . Here is where you can buy SS109 armour piercing ammo : http : //ammoman.com/ I agree , the Brady Bill is laughable to criminals who want the contraban items . You do not even have to buy them , you can make them yourself . I agree that the cops are not the best protection . The best protection is YOU for YOURSELF . Only you are on the spot the quickest when you are threatened . Only you are able the judge quickest weather your saftey is threatened . Seach on any engine : police accidental shooting . It is quite alarming how many times cops shoot the innocent . If cops can get to a crime scene in time , they have to sort out the criminal and the victim very quickly under difficult conditions . In essence , they do not get the whole story , until it is over . You may even gen a criminal pretending to be a victim , only to shoot the cops in the back . That is why victims at the crime scene are the best judge of who needs to be shoot first . For my own personal situation , I do not recommend just buying a gun for protection . Also seek training and lots of it . Then practice , practice , practice , and then practice some more . No matter how justified you are defending your life with firearm , you must still defend your actions in a court of law , especially if human life was taken . I do not agree with people carrying firearms with no training . That is a very personal decision and I will not stop anyone from carrying a firearm if they choose to do so .
So what is being monitored by the ribosome ? Information . Material representations ( amino acid sequence vs DNA sequence ) of information . But , it does not only monitor it , it manipulates it as a means to an end ... fidelity .
Well , I see that Hunter continues with his intentional ignorance . Even though it has been explained to him on several occasions , he still chants his `` evolution is only a theory '' mantra in hopes that his audience will be as ignorant as he . Yes , evolution is a theory . In science that means that it has been tested and accepted as essentially correct . Evolution is a theory just as gravity is a theory - several in fact ; Newtonian gravity , general relativity , and quantum gravity . None of those theories actually work in all situations . But for all practical purposes , evolution has been proven . That 's easy since evolution has been observed and the theories are build on the facts of those observations . You will notice that Hunter has n't proven any of his assertions . He just knows that there are talking snakes , and magical beings that make people out of dirt . Sure - go ahead and start with the Bible so you can get the mythology of two different creation stories , an impossible flood , and such fantasies as a man being swallowed by a whale or the any human would know about a god that wagers with Satan , out of the way . Not only will you find no proof to support the Bible , you wo n't evern find any evidence .
But the civil war was n't fought for slavery . If you will recall the average northern soldier was n't too fond of blacks , and that is not only sugar coating it , but saying it in the nicest terms possible . The civil war was fought to keep the union in tact . Border states still kept their slaves for obvious reasons , the intactness of the union trumped any moral principal . Besides , that was n't true even in practice . Black soldiers were paid less , had less equipment , had less medical care and were given the worst jobs possible . Hardly created equal . It took some time before they could even fight . Your argument is a load of garbage to someone who actually has knownledge about the civil war . I wo n't even go into the reconstruction period and how your so called principal did n't even exist .
Because murder 's already illegal and there 's nothing more that can be done about it .
Actually it could n't be any worse then it is right now . More people historically have died at the hands of religious wars then non-religion . Religion has been used to push extreme political viewpoints , selfishness , racism , destruction of whole cultures , hatred , and ignorance . Wow that 's something for you to be proud of eh grizzly6626 ? Through religion , televangelists have become pimps where cash is more important than integrity . While I have n't seen any atheists with bombs strapped to themselves , we 've all see plenty of religious fools blowing themselves up each and every day . And of course we all know how peaceful and charitable The Spanish Inquisition was . I guess it 's true , when it comes to religion IGNORANCE is bliss ... BTW - you forgot to mention that hitler was a devout catholic . Yeah , like I said before , it could n't be any worse then it is right now
Have you seen who our current President is ?
Oh no , it 's not too complex for us to understand . So please explain to we simpletons how Intelligent Design is nothing more than animism . But first , here is the truth regarding this newest perverse propaganda you are promoting .
Well , I think it 's selfish that you want a woman to not terminate a fetus that possibly could develop into a baby becaue you think that every woman is capable of looking after it .
Just so you know , the majority of Japanese cars sold in the US are also assembled in the US and thus provide Americans with thousands of jobs at these plants .
** Except that hypermutation is not something that happens to a 'cell ' , but happens to a collectivity of millions of inter-connected , inter-related cells , and that hypermutation in bacteria colonies is not 'stochastic ' , but 'heuristic ' , and you are just going to have to accept that those words are not synonyms .
So , you are going to ignore the fact that you just suggested that it was the Democrats trying to pass the immigration bill when it was really bipartisan ? Really , Phyllis , are you too proud to admit that you were wrong ?
`` Lottery '' ? I hope you do n't mean that it is completely random in all cases ... Note : did you notice that this was the position you were arguing against in the previous sentence ?
Maybe Massachusetts should allow for divorces via notarized mail by non-residents or whatever else is needed to make it easier to do so remotely and more timely , if someone has a serious need to get a legal divorce for such a marriage that only exists somewhere else . What interest would a state that does n't recognize gay marriage in the first place have in allowing gay divorce ?
No mark , no bullet hole nothing . Her and her father claim that I just touched my gun ... which I did n't ! They even testified at the preliminary that I did n't touch anyone nor did I make any threat what so ever . That I just put my hand on my gun . The police on the scene did n't charge me . They went to the Sheriffs Dept and took warrants on me and my mother . My wife got my mom for assault claiming she was trying to grab our daughter from her and was fighting with her . Yet again no marks.I even have evidence of premeditated revenge from threatening text messages days earlier from her dad and her saying stuff on myspace . She took out orders of protection on us but the judge dismissed them QUICK ! We got indicted so now we 're facing a plea hearing . The other judge made us take joint custody . Primary custody has yet been asigned . My lawyer is the best in the area and also a good friend of mine . He 's trying to get it dropped before court . But they claim I just touched my Glock . That does n't meet the statute really in these circumstances . The responding officers even thought it was BS .
To be honest I 'm still not sure what your plasticity arguement is about . You seem to argue that animals can change shape and design like pokemon when the need arises . Now , my body , in the precence of foreign organisms , will create brand new protiens designed to kill the invaders , but this is a simple genetic process well understood by biologists . I still ask you to show me some study where an animal has been placed in an altered environment and makes a larger beak , grows extra limbs , etc . The problem with your fish and moth examples are growing larger shells or changing colors are abilities , not permanent changes , that are shared by the organism 's offspring . If a snail grew a large shell when there were many predators around , its offspring would not have the same large shells unless a similar predator threat existed . You 're arguements about plasticity essentially claim the story of how the elephant got its trunk is a valid evolutionary theory .
Oddly enough I found Thomas 's opinion to be most compelling . The dissent was surprisingly weak ... even for a dissent . It did n't even really make sense . The actual opinion was kinda weak but I got bored reading it so I skimmed the second half . Ha .
You state `` the woman comes first '' . This seems to be your only `` absolute '' . Why does the woman come first ? Is it because she is fully developed ? Is she more important than the child she is carrying ?
Why is that propoganda ? It 's exactly what you do .
And that is more likely than a magical being who poofed everything from nothing , do n't you agree ?

`` He '' is real to all of us fjp , whether we acknowledge Him or not , God is alive and well on Planet Earth . And the day comes for each man when he faces that reality . For some of us it 's a long awaited day of joy and for others a long dreaded day . But believe me when I tell you that just because one denies that God exists , it does nothing to lessen His reality .
Well if there can be a Constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage , why not to remove marrriage from the federal government ? Where do they get that power Constitutionally ? So that would mean states can choose not to recognize any marriage Constitutionally . I think that marriage is a church issue . Let gays , straights , everyone get civil unions to be recognized legally . But leave marriage to the churches .
We are n't . Not even in literature classes are we taught this .
My mom can only trace her family back a few generations . By the time we get to the clan that lived in Ohio in the middle of the 19th century , the records get very confusing and very incomplete . By creationist logic , we must then accept that my ancestors , white Americans , were specially created in North America by God .
No , Christianity holds that Jesus IS God . That Jesus also is NOT God just shows how contradictory the Bible is for Christians ( but they overlook logic and hold blindly to their silly trinity position anyway ) .
So , we on this board are n't receptive to your proselytizing ? Sorry about that . This particular forum is intended to be a scientific discussion , based on logic and evidence . We certainly do n't want to waste your time . The door is over there . I find your dismissive , superior attitude to be offensive , to be honest. , so I ca n't say I 'll miss you . But should you ever want to discuss evolution and creation in terms of actual science you will be welcome to return .
You make some great points but she could carry the baby to term and then put it up for adoption ... ... ... ..There are long lists of people wanting to adopt babies ... ... ... ..I know a couple that waited 5 years and then adopted a child from South Korea ... ... ... . Why does the innocent baby have to forfeit its life ?
Actually , natural selection tends to preserve a species with only minor changes in a stable environment . But environments tend to change . I do n't know what that `` incipient organ '' junk is supposed to mean . Is that another way of saying `` what good is half a wing . '' Well , check out a penguin to find out . Look at a seal flipper . It has the same bones , arranged in the same way as a monkey . What good is it for a land animal ? And what does `` fully functional '' mean ? What function ? Perhaps the new organ had a different purpose - take the clawed hands of fossil birds for example . They were good for catching prey and climbing , just like they were for their dinosaur ancestors . But those clawed wings also allowed early birds to fly .
Another oft-repeated lie .
What in the Hell does evolution have to do with people doing bad things ? I am a believer in creation by God and have never heard such drivel . BOY-HOWDY ! ! !
Who needs an oath not to do what any American should find repugnant ?
See 'lithium ' statement
If you had bothered to spend more than two seconds actually looking up what happened , you would 've seen that Joe Horn was cleared of all wrong doings by a grand jury , not on the grounds of the new Castle Doctrine of Texas , but the already existing laws that permits the use of deadly force for preventing property crimes . These laws were on the books for years before Texas officially adopted the NRA endorsed Castle Doctrine . And even so , what 're you complaining about ? Would you rather Joe Horn be the one killed and the criminals alive today ?
You mean to tell me you would deny a life to be lived out and someone to get away with a harmful crime ? ? wow , sounds like a liberal to me..
The original paper is here . Dr. Schweitzer uses an ostrich egg to compare the structure and layout of the vessels . The chicken comes in from a reacting factor that showed a reaction in the presence of the subfossil 'collagen ' material . He has n't changed it on this occasion , he 's just not able to read context ... . Oh , by the way AA , are you planning on replying ? Or do you cede that fossil discussion ?
The issue is about you linking an incident where a pregnant woman had so little regard for her unborn baby that she picked a fight with the police and somehow use it to demonise the police and the pro life people . I could not imagine anyone could be stupid enough to do this without the aid of strong drink but thank you for reminding me that you can do it easily .
See , this is where reading the page would have helped you out alot . No where does it say that organisms evolve with a changing environment . That 's what WW would like it to say , but it says nothing of the sort . All it talks about is a different approach to modeling cell behavior . Critical reading skills , they 're really essential if you 're going to try to debate science .
And science helped Stenger write his book . How can the same subject make a stronger case for both of two completely opposing viewpoints ? another
Sure , I have no problem with the idea of a given state allowing a straight couple to file for divorce remotely somehow , if that couple is residing in a different state .
When is science going to get started on the book of Exodus ? Job ? Proverbs ?
And rightfully so . I 'll prove it with the exact legislation .
Really ! Then I assume that you have read Darwin - at least On the Origin of Species . Otherwise you are babbling . Please cite specific passages from Darwin 's books where he made `` morals and ethics '' a joke . Please also do the same for the works of Dawkins . Your assertion presumes that you have read the works of both men .
What a joke . You 're going to attempt to tell me , with a straight face , that cops do n't look out for their fellow cops ? Sorry , NO SALE .
Oh no ! Here comes Palin , run for cover . Because I really fear ignorant and hypocritical conservatives . As to your argument , while were out calling fertilized eggs `` men '' , lets call plant life `` men '' as well .
If echolocation is superior to vision , why have n't more animals evolved this fantastic ability ? Why has n't natural selection weeded out species with their inferior `` optical vision '' and given them all echolocation , which would allow them superior senses in day and night , rather than just daytime ?
So where in there does Behe say that brute luck is actually impossible ? Nowhere . Where in there does Behe say that brute luck can be absolutely and definitively ruled out , 100 % . Nowhere . As I originally said , We can find such an explanation wanting or unsatisfying , but being highly unlikely is not the same as proving it could not happen. This is quite in line with Behes statements in his book . Further , PROVING it IMPOSSIBLE is what you would have had to have done to PROVE that evolution is false . Behe says it ca n't be proven impossible : that it ca n't be completely refuted . ( And quite frankly , most of us would agree that claiming that an IC system - or multiple IC systems - arose by multiple simultaneous mutations is in no way comparable to claiming that the word luckily popped into existence yesterday with all the features it now has. Behe 's not being fully honest here . ) What I quoted Behe saying is exactly what he said and is his position on the matter . I have NOT misrepresented Behes position on this . Now , a charge of wrongdoing is discarded unless the party making the accusation can fully support his charge : burden of proof falls upon the accuser , not the accused . Youve failed to support your charge , so I prevail . Now , if you want to continue pushing your charge of wrongdoing on my part , you need to show where , in Behes Darwins Black Box , he goes on to show that brute luck is actually impossible : where Behe shows that brute luck can be absolutely and definitively ruled out , 100 % . Until you do , you have failed to rebut my counter to your statements , and , I am also cleared of your false charges . PS : The only one playing around with context here is YOU ! The context of my statements was that you claimed to have PROVEN EVOLUTION false , and I pointed out that : ( 1 ) in order for you to have succeeded , one of several things you would have to do ( but did n't ) is to DISPROVE multiple , simultaneous mutations ( brute luck ) and ( 2 ) Behe himself says that multiple , simultaneous mutations CAN NOT be absolutely ruled out . Try to keep the context , okay .
No . Differential reproductive success .

We all know of course that the partial birth abortion procedure is never medically necessary to save the life of the mother . Now , you seem to believe that men are just trying to endager women . `` Those men just want to opress women . They just do n't understand . Men are just pieces of XXXX . I hate men ... '' The bill overturned by the `` judges '' was HB1541 . As you can see , this passed the House of delegates by a whopping 76-20 vote . It passed the Senate by a whopping 29-11 vote . Let 's see some of the people who voted for this bill . Kathy Byron Jeannemarie Davis Thelma Drake Michelle Mcquigg Melanie Rapp Beverly Sherwood Terri Suit Yvonne Miller Those male pigs ... all they want is to opress women . They have no concern for women whatsoever . They would only make a bill like this to opress women .
I think extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence . There is not `` overwhelming documentation '' for the gospel story . There is next to none .
The first sentence is inaccurate , as is the first part of the second sentence . Therefore the quesion of 'are you not teaching your opinion , sir ? ' is moot . The theory of evolution has nothing to do with opinion . It matters not whether or not anyone believes in it . Evolution has been observed . There is no known evidence to suggest that evolution does not occur .
False and that does n't invalide evolution given how it 's a misrepresentation of one of the statements in the theory . Gould can take his comments and shove them up his *** .
Yes , and depending on how you define morality .
If you can convince me that your soul mate , best friend , the one that you ca n't think of anyone else you would want to share your life , dreams , fears , successes with , who knows what your thinking and loves you anyway and feels the same then sure I guess I would consider it . Since we are on the subject of ridiculous how about a snowflake or a pine tree or a sunflower seed , talk about love blossoming .
Well that may be your contention , but medically that is not necessarily true . Maybe being gay does n't mean you are suicidal or depressed , but there is more of it going on in the gay life than in the hetero . That in itself is a wake up call . Depression and suicide are harmful , even if it does n't touch you personally . If it were as simple as you say the APA would n't be re-evaluating `` reorientation therapies '' would they and with positive critiques too . You would n't have prominent gay activists like Camile Paglia deriding the gay community for being malcontent when those unhappy with being gay seek and desire the way to be hetero .
And what always triumphs is the easiest answer . POOF ! is easy . It takes no time . MQ
You know something , I just came here to browse , but upon discovering that you feel that people who believe in God are stupid , and their beliefs are stupid , just # # # # # # me off . Not that you dont believe , but your use of the word stupid . I happen to be one of those stupid people you refer to , and so I will say this- People can say or believe whatever they want to , but we are all going to die one day , and something will be waiting on us when we do die , so before you start calling people names , I would explore the possibility that maybe christians are right , because in the inescapable end , we will all find out . And if we as christians are right , your eternal future dont look to good . And one more little thought , people thought the guy who said the world was round was stupid , but he was right in the end .
Current 'treatment ' includes : Use of a placebo Laying on of hands Prayer Tossing salt over thy shoulder Planting 3 kernels of rice in the ground under your home Saying the Pledge of Allegience And thanking the Obamasiah for a bountiful crop of beets . Oh , and if you can locate the witch , have her confess to the crime of making you ill ... and punished for doing so ... you stand a better chance of living longer with said cancers .
I think therefore I am , I do n't think therefore I am not . You can not say something like 'Lets ask the baby what it thinks ' . That is like asking a brain dead person what he thinks . The brain dead person is n't there . He does n't exist in our world . His body is there , but he is n't . That is assuming you place emphasis on the mind making us what we are like I do . You could debate this though although it is legal to pull the plug on the brain dead person . I 've never actually felt so deeply about this topic as I do now after you mentioned the wife dying for the kid to live . It makes me sick even thinking about how you would have her so easily accept her death . Perhaps you feel the same way about how easily I accept the death of an unborn . However , I want you to put yourself in some situations where either you or your wife or daughter or son or mother and father will have to deal with this type of situation . I do n't want you to just answer with no real feeling and just do it for the sake of debating my point of view . Take it to heart and actually think it over . I ca n't believe you can not find a single case where you would wish to have the choice or wish for someone else to have the choice .
That is not a law to respect , the civil right in the Second Amendment IS ! It is unconstitutional to require a license for a right freely given in the Constitution . - Murdoch vs. Pennsylvania plus about 8 more such rulings . You just do n't like the BOR brady , that is the Supreme Law of the Land .
We 've answered these questions already over and over again and you 'll get the same ones as well .
Hello , please read http : //www.reasons.org/resources/apo ... ing.shtml ? main It is a good christian site that explains that there are lots of problems with Dr Russell Humphreys ' hypothesis . The universe and Earth are very old . We know this as a fact . Why would God lie to us ? If the Universe looks old , then it is . To claim otherwise is to call God a liar .
Duh ! You do n't seem to have a grasp on what science is . Science is n't a search for truth . It is an attempt to explain observations naturalistic events without appeals to gods , angels , or demons .
Women 's rights actually exist , unlike the Christian God .
`` Since some of these transcripts ferry code for proteins as dutiful mRNAs , this new perspective would encompass traditional genes . '' That is indeed the funny , ironic bit , that the article SS cites as `` death of genes '' specifically refutes his claim .
Maryland already has the law on the books . It 's effect thus far has only been to eliminate certain makes and models from the Maryland marketplace and to extinguish the sale of certain collectables .
You are on some different planet there . Science does n't need one conclusion or the other . The traditional classification of neandertals has been Homo sapiens neanderthalensis , i.e. , in the same species . Then genetic work suggested that neandertals were distinct enough to merit being a separate species [ Hodges , S. B. , 2000 , Human Evolution : A start for population genomics . Nature ( 7 Dec. 2000 ) : 408 ( 6813 ) :652-653 . ] . Results since then have been mixed . Some DNA work indicates a 5 % admixture from Neandertals ( Plagnol V , Wall JD , 2006 , Possible ancestral structure in human populations . PLoS Genetics @ http : //genetics.plosjournals.org/per ... 20105.eor & amp ; ct=1 ) . Various fossils continue to suggest some interbreeding . ( Note also that a genetic finding of no interbreeding does not conflict with fossilized hybrids - it merely says that any hybrids or hybrid lines ended up dying out before they contributed to any lineages that were successful all the way to the present . ) A finding of 99.5 to 99.9 % genetic similarity is what we expect , given the clear similarity of the two groups .
Actually , I find it near impossible to discuss the second amendment without gun control advocates bringing up the third argument . Weak ? Yes . Rare ? No . In my opinion , all arguments in favor of gun control are weak .
Well , the slavery analogy for gay rights is past it 's applicability at this point -- one was a property issue ( also rooted in deep prejudice ) , the other is a morality issue . Many people oppose gay marriage out of morality and NOT prejudice . The same ca n't be said for slavery . There are many ways that the analogy does n't work and that 's just one of them . In fact , it could as easily be an analogy to reverse it and say that the ones who did the enslaving were analogous to gay rights lobbyists and the abolitionists were analogous to those who seek to protect marriage . After all , the plantation owners were the ones really fighting for ill-conceived rights -- rights that they should n't have had .
how is it discrimination when they are n't being denied rights everyone else has ? They have no right that I do n't have . Read my previous posts before you respond . Also affirmative action is helping those that are disadvantaged to do the same things that those that are n't disadvantaged like the American wiht Disabilites act . It 's not asking to give them different rights .
and thats just kiddish !
When a new structure evolves , it 's quite clear .
But the big bang did not create matter . Matter can neither be created nor destroyed . The matter was already there . You might just as easily ask if god was there to create the universe , where did this god come from . Your answer would be that god has always been there , but I would argue that the matter has always been there . The only difference between these theories is that mine has one less assumption .
You got it . People make mistakes . Finally you see that scientists are just as human as religious people .
But in the context of Debaters usual arguments on this board , one might presume that he is trying to imply that somehow a side that he favors is not being given a fair hearing . It seems to be an echo of the oft expressed creationist cry that it is only fair that if a scientific theory that they oppose on religious grounds is presented in science class , i.e. , evolution , then their side should also be presented on a equal basis with science . I thought it might be of some interest to understand Jeffersons motivations behind the above quote . After Jefferson left office and retired to Monticello he continued to do business with a bookseller in Philadelphia named N. G. Dufief . Apparently on some occasions , Jefferson would purchase books that were sent directly to him at Monticello and Mr. Dufief would act as Jeffersons agent for payment . Jefferson would then , from time to time , settle accounts with Mr. Dufief . That seems to have been the case with a book by M. de Becourt entitled , Sur la Création du Monde , un Systême d'Organisation Primitive . Jefferson had seen notice of the books publication and presumed it to be  either a geological or astronomical work. He ordered it to be sent to him upon publication with instructions that Mr. Dufief be contacted for payment . Thus , Mr. Dufief became involved with a book that he had never seen . Mr. Dufief extended credit to Mr. Jefferson , as was his custom , and paid for the book . But such little technicalities never stopped the forces of good in the community . From the title alone criminal charges were brought against Mr. Dufief for crimes against religion . I do not know to outcome of the case but presume that Mr. Dufief was acquitted . The quote that Debater got almost correct is from a letter that Jefferson wrote to Dufief about the matter . At the end of the letter Jefferson discusses settling accounts by adding the unknown price of Newtons Principia to his balance of $ 4.93 and sending it along to Philadelphia . Here are Jeffersons comments on the case of Mr. Dufief from a letter of April 19 , 1814 .
And what you post is n't with bogus sources ?
Screw you . Done . : D
The Word of God says otherwise . Romans 1:25-27 - They exchanged the truth of God for a lie , and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creatorwho is forever praised ... Because of this , God gave them over to shameful lusts . Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones . In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another . Men committed indecent acts with other men , and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion . You 've rewritten Biblical Christianity . 2 Timothy 4:3-4 ( New International Version ) - For the time will come when they will not put up with sound doctrine . Instead , to suit their own desires , they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear .
Well then maybe you can prove it somehow . California has all these laws you support , and even more than that . So if they have these laws on the books and have had them for a while now , and if they 're effective at fighting crime , then you must surely have evidence of some sort to prove your case .
People with big egos have libidos that keep up . what 's new ? It 's an unfortunate accompanying characteristic . The only reason that this was even posted was because it was another attempt to discredit anyone that is against gay marriage . The fact that most politicians cheat is n't a revelation .
Basic law 101 : You can drive by 15 1/2 with A LICENSED ADULT OVER 25 IN THE CAR . Not 18 or 21 , but 25 so it is n't a matter of potential peers watching each other . And your opening post referred to 14 year olds or above , as it shows below .
Yea , and so is gardening . Both are `` murdering '' living things . Both do not mentally exist . A strand of DNA is the only difference , which is n't very much .
Or helpful .
And once you build one straw man , you tend to substantially build even bigger ones .
Why did n't they `` fire '' and `` bar '' him in the sixties ?
Kerry is pro-choice . He is in favour of allowing abortions to continue . It matters not why . That 's not what we 're discussing . It is irrelevant then to speak of the history of the USA etc . I 'm not questioning his motives . I 'm stating he 's in favour of abortion . He is . I quoted from him . You continue supposition that he is not .
So you feel that Mrs Vo should have been allowed to run the risk of dying ? Your statement `` An abortion never has to be done '' only holds true if you place the value of the unborn child over that of the mother in all cases . Do you really believe that ?
That 's the worse definition of science ever .
I 'll address the later question . They may not `` need '' teeth that big , I could n't say . Just because a creature has a feature does n't mean its necessary or useful . While evolution does select for useful traits and against harmful traits , that does n't mean that a trait wo n't develop that is simply odd . As long as it is n't particularly negative there 's no reason to assume it will go away , and so sometimes you get traits that are n't `` useful '' , they 're simply not harmful . Those teeth could be such a case .
That is amazing . I find it crazy that this baby is much younger and smaller and far less developed than many of the babies that are aborted . Abortion is murder .
You know what , since simple contradiction without reason while ignoring any responses seems to be good enough for you evolutionist I will simply save my words . Evolution does not explain the advancement of life . OHH AHH , beat that one .
Bull ! If everybody was shooting at this deranged individual he would 've been reduced to swiss cheese , and then nobody would have cause to fire anymore because the threat would be neutralized and all guns would be returned to their holsters .
Because his , as a Christian , does n't follow the Christian Bible to anywhere near the extent that mine does .
Yes , because although we trust our military with anti tank missiles , .50 machine guns , artillery , fighter planes , cruise missiles and even nuclear weapons , god knows you would n't want them parading around in public with a glock under their jacket unless they have renewed their permit in person . I would have thought that people would have learned their lesson from the federal assault weapon ban . It was expensive to enforce , a major sore spot for a fairly large percentage of the population , and had no real positive effect , mainly due to the fact that it addressed no identifiable problem . You expect such things from a liberal stronghold like california , a state with high crime that is always on the verge of bankruptcy , out of control labor costs , where they ca n't even keep the power on all the time becuase their environmental regulations are so rediculously stringent that the fiscal realities of building new powerplants are soo terrible that nobody would even consider it . I thought people were more intelligent in your new state , George .
Archie , why should anyone even bother with you ? You ask someone to explain polystrate fossils-three people do . You plug your ears and go `` la-la-la , I ca n't hear you '' , then demand that someone explain polystrate fossils . Someone else posts 100 categories of evidence against a global flood , and you wave it away as `` evo lies '' . Yet you demand we take your biased site at face value . I swear , you get dumber by the minute .
How do you know none of the `` children '' were actually gang members engaged in illegal activity , and that fact was simply excluded because it was n't considered newsworthy ?
Rahm Emanuel for one . He seems to sum up the message very well . And then there 's Carolyn McCarthy who actually introduced the bill that , if passed into law , would cancel your Second Amendment rights just because your name is on the no fly list . Just two names , perhaps , but they 're the names of people in a very powerful and dangerous position , capable of making very bad things happen .
Actually , at 24 weeks is when the the interconnection of the fetal brain begins . The nerve cells from the neocortex begin to synapse with the nerve cells of the thalamus . It is at this point that bursts of recognizable brain waves start to appear among the random signals that go on before . It is at this point that some scientists believe a fetus can feel pain as well . It is also at this point that a fetus can possibly survive outside of the womb ( 23-24 weeks ) , though the cance of survival is low and the risk of impairment very serious . This point probably wo n't change with technology either because the fetal lung is not mature enough until this point for even mechanical-assisted breathing .
Well I guess you apparently trust the political bunch and rich and famous .
Perhaps it is just semantics here , but a place that tells a mythical tale rather than relating reality does n't have the right to call itself a museum . It is a theme park .
Yes , but Christians have suffered in order to live out their faith for nearly 2000 years . Only one of the Apostles lived out the full measure of their days , most of them died violent deaths for refusing to renounce the Gospel . I make no claims to being worthy to stand in the company of the saints and martyrs , but their example is there , the way of Christ leads to the cross .
I believe Western society undervalues the role of a woman in the raising children period so would say all women who have children and sacrifice personal monetary gain to look after that child deserve financial recognition from the State for that effort .
Not to be pedantic but have you any sources to the uk study from 1999 please ? Only asking because it does n't make sense that termination of a first pregnancy can increase the chances of breast cancer yet a miscarriage or still born in a first pregnancy does n't yet in both cases the hormonal changes have not run to completion .
Ahh . Now I see why you turned into an agnostic , if you even believed Christianity in the first place .
Zoos are indeed a good example . Although the environments are made as close as possible to the natural habitats , penguins are often kept in open-air enclosures in temperate or even tropical climates . And there are two critical differences in even the most carefully constructed zoo : the absence of any predators , and the absence of any prey . So why do n't the animals quickly/purposefully/nonrandomly cease exhibiting developmentally costly traits which give them an advantage against predators or prey who are n't present ?
So are you defending thier actions then ?
Really . Have you got any quotes from them endorsing monopolies ?
In this case , I will present the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection as evidence that life is evolving . As the evidence has been shown to support it , you are the person who should be presenting evidence . Currently , your assertion that organisms are `` devolving '' because of mutations has been shown to be faulty .
Being refuted by organized groups with an agenda they support does not make Supwersports ideas wrong . You call it garbage . I AM interested in what Supersport thinks about how his ideas will get wider respect and how he thinks this will change our society . I think this is an important question , because otherwise posting here seems like a kind of mutual masterbation trading facts and arguments that have no effect . Until I hear from SS , I give him the benefit of the doubt .
Uranus . Is . A . Ball . Of . Gas . Genius .
Well there you go again mixing up a belief in creation ( creationists ) with a belief that the idea of creation can be based in science ( creation science ) This is why you are anti-religious in your post . Not everyone who believes in creation , is a creation scientist . I believe in creation , and I 'm not a creation scientist , so when you attack us all through confusion , you are , well ... attacking us all . Such is your zeal to do so , based as it is , on a philosophy of science .
They ca n't , if you value science and common sense , however , science and common sense are irrelevent in their world .
Sigh ... .what a bad question .
And you think this a good thing ? It just shows the weak cowardly position of the creationist .
I do n't understand what point your trying to make here . Good citizens vs criminals with the criminals 'winning ' is usually not the way it goes . Good citizens are the ones who catch and throw the criminals in jail . They are our police officers , the anonymous tipsters , and the countless law abiding citizens in our country . The way your talking you act like the only way for the good citizens to win is to have a gun or be ready to use force . If you want to do one better you could eliminate guns completely in order to lower the risk of deaths in gun fights . You ca n't debate the fact that less guns equals less murders . You can debate that without guns there would be more deaths to other weapons although you ca n't debate it would be to the same extent as gun murders and crimes would be . You talk about hope like it rests on whether you have the ability to kill another person or not . The criminals are the ones that have to hope . They are the ones who are outnumbered thousands to one and their weapon is n't going to protect them from that . I 'm not trying to make the case that guns should be banned . I 'm not trying to make the case that all criminals will get caught . I 'm not trying to make the case that we are already in the best possible system for fighting crime or when it comes to gun control . What I am saying is that you can not possible expect that just because our society does n't expect people to carry around guns that the criminals will be able to walk all over us . They are the ones who are running most of the time . They are the ones who have their lives taken away most of the time . They are the ones who have their lives ruined and ruin the lives of the ones they know most of the time . I 'd much rather be a good citizen without a weapon than a criminal with one for I know who has the odds on their side .
The definition of manslaughter is when one 's actions , which end up killing someone , display a reckless disregard for the dangers of the situation . That 's not a proper legal definition , but it 'll do . Now , you want to argue that pro-lifers would be forced into the counterintuitive conclusion that ALL miscarriage is manslaughter , and thus their position is ridiculous . I 'm saying that they would only be forced to admit that a very small portion of miscarriage is manslaughter , and a portion that they would probably be willing to make a case for . I 'm not saying `` miscarriage is not manslaughter , '' but only `` miscarriage is not always manslaughter . '' For example , if a woman took perfectly good care of herself and did nothing dangerous , but had a miscarriage anyway , she would obviously not have committed manslaughter . If a woman had one drink with dinner , but she was carrying a very unhealthy fetus and it died , then she would not have committed manslaughter , because that was not reckless . I pointed out the `` you-shouldn't-be-drinking-and-having-unprotected-sex '' argument as a position somebody might hold , but I think that it would probably be judged as unrepresentative of the definition of manslaughter . So obviously , miscarriage can not be manslaughter in the sense of `` every instance of A is an instance of B . ''
The logic is in knowing beforehand that your hand will be burned if stuck into a fire . This has nothing to do with the physical aspects of heat , nerves and burning skin .
I know that not all people who are pro-life are woman-hating . I , too want to see abortion reduced to the bare minimum . I just disagree with most pro-lifers on how to accomplish that . My issue was with ROCC 's attitude in the post I was responding to . To summarize he/she said that your should n't get pregnant and if you do - you just get to deal with it . There is absolutely no regard for an individual 's situation , the attack is entirely focused on women and it offers NOTHING that will help reduce abortion . ROCC 's statement was quite woman-hating , but no , it is not indicative of the pro-life side 's feelings about women . The only times I am compelled to really think pro-lifers are anti-woman is when they have the `` pregnancy is a woman 's due punishment for promiscuity '' attitude or demand that a woman die/put her health jeapardy or demand rape victims go through with pregnancies . If you ca n't see the woman in even those most extreme situations , then you clearly have zero regard for women . I believe that abortion stands it best chance at being reduced by addressing the things that lead to unplanned pregnancy and the reasons women choose to abort . To demonize women and simply take away choice without addressing these things will not reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies , or gauarantee responsible choices . It will lead desperate women to desperate action , though ( i.e. , coat hangers ) .
So sorry , Anastasia ... that 's a horrible thing to face . And now , using that excuse ? What ! If justice was swift for the guilty then he would not have escaped only to do it again . Some criminals never change , and via your testimony , only live to do it again . There are some who need to be put to death . Your situation made me shudder , Anastasia . But , I am glad you did n't let it ( revenge ) effect you to the point of taking his life yourself . If it would have been my father , those many years ago , I can not say that I would have waited , nor would have accepted that lame excuse of retardation . I could very well be in prison myself .
But you think SETI is worthwhile !
And from where did you get this idea ? Please provide your references .
So it does n't matter that someone dies in their forties from hunger and cold because they are homeless and penniless , whilst another lives in luxury with the best food and medicines until his 80s : they are both equal ? What planet do you live on , for it sure are n't the real world ...
So when somebody with bad intentions breaks and crawls in through a window , and shuts off your power so you ca n't use the telephone , and comes busting through your basement door , shooting them is vigilante justice ? To you this situation does n't qualify as self-defense ? I highly doubt the woman is lying about the entire matter , because if she was the prosecuting attorney and the police would n't be so willing to not press charges against her .
Bertvan : Perhaps Dr. Pigluicci doesnt see a difference between the organization of a hurricane and the organization of a living system . Most people do see a difference . The deterministic mechanisms that affect a hurricane are well understood and predictable . On the other hand no one can even speculate how such things as temperature and embryonic diet might cause proteins to fold differently and thus whip up complex systems such as eyes , bacterial flagella , wings and turtle shells .
Why are you so afraid of religion ?
It goes beyond the text to assume that there were .
The `` study '' fails to do this . It offers a philosophical `` proof '' only , as the scientific method is not used in any way in the `` study '' .
Who is killing children ? Except for George Bush who has seen to the killing of thousands of children in Iraq .
And that remark is relevant because ? Just to inform you once again , the word is `` stasis . '' You make yourself look ignorant and foolish when you ca n't even spell correctly . However , stasis is the norm in a stable environment . The reasons are simple . Organisms tend to become well adapted to a stable environment . As Richard Dawkins would explain , they tend to become adapted to a particular nich in a particular environment , and when that environment undergoes rapid change , they go extinct . The fossil record is full of such examples . Dawkins used the analogy of climbing a mountain of adaptation that made it impossible for the organism to cross to the peak of the new environment . Try reading `` Climbing Mount Improbable '' for an understanding .
Oh how wonderful for you . You can say something like this so easily without having to consider anything but what someone else would have to do . Are you a man or woman ? As a man you would never have to live by the advice your giving but would you so willingly follow your advice if your wife had to make the choice ? How about your mom ? How about your sister ? How about your child ? For a woman it is slightly different as you may have to follow through with this yourself . How would you explain this to your parents ? How about your kids ? How could you die knowing your husband would have to raise your killer ? Would n't you wonder ? As a husband what would be the affects of knowing your kid killed your loved one ? In a vacuum where only one life is affected I guess I could agree with you . However , hundreds of lives are affected . And lets not forget , I 'm the one debating that people should be given a choice here while your trying to force them into a choice . Your the one who is saying this specific suffering has to occur while I 'm saying make your own decision and pick the suffering you deem the least of the two horrible options .
Thou Shalt Not Kill . Seems to be a pretty convenient verse to throw around . Does anyone who actually quotes the Bible bother to look up the Hebrew meanings ? I do n't think so . You have to remember that the OT is wrote in Hebrew , Chaldean , and some Arabic . For the most part , words we use today , will have the same meaning . But in some instances they DO N'T . Take the word `` kill '' for an example . If you own a Bible dictionary or concordance then it should inform you that the word kill in the Ten Commandments means to commit manslaughter . There is alot more to the actual commentary on this word and it is quite interesting . But to say that killing was breaking a specific commandment and to use that as a reasoning against capital punishment is wrong . How do you explain all the wars that rage after the commandments were penned ? How do you explain the cities of refuge set up for those folks quilty of accidentally killing another person . See Numbers 35:11 . Distinctly two different meanings for the word kill .
After a Devastating Birth Injury , Hope By DENISE GRADY DODOMA , Tanzania & # 8212 ; Lying side by side on a narrow bed , talking and giggling and poking each other with skinny elbows , they looked like any pair of teenage girls trading jokes and secrets . But the bed was in a crowded hospital ward , and between the moments of laughter , Sarah Jonas , 18 , and Mwanaidi Swalehe , 17 , had an inescapable air of sadness . Pregnant at 16 , both had given birth in 2007 after labor that lasted for days . Their babies had died , and the prolonged labor had inflicted a dreadful injury on the mothers : an internal wound called a fistula , which left them incontinent and soaked in urine ... . Obstructed labor can kill the mother , too , or crush her bladder , uterus and vagina between her pelvic bones and the baby & # 8217 ; s skull . The injured tissue dies , leaving a fistula : a hole that lets urine stream out constantly through the vagina . In some cases , the rectum is damaged and stool leaks out . Some women also have nerve damage in the legs . One of the most striking things about the women in Ward 2 was how small they were . Many stood barely five feet tall , with slight frames and narrow hips , which may have contributed to their problems . Girls not fully grown , or women stunted by malnutrition , often have small pelvises that make them prone to obstructed labor.http : //www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/he ... 4hospital.html
Pain is the best teaching tool .
Its not very risky anymore ...
Because self-government loses its meaning totally if the people are prohibited from amending their constitution by persons other than themselves . I really do not support rule by the very , very few .
Indeed . If a teacher teaches 'the controversey ' correctly , and lays out the facts and let 's kids decide for themselves ( is that done for ANY subject ? ) , certainly , the most indoctrinated will say creation wins . But what about the open-minded ? What about the students that can actually grasp the fact that creationism offers nothing in the way of supporting evidence ? that is rests solely on trying to poke holes in evolution and appeals to biblical authority ? Those students will conclude that creatiomnism is bogus , and may cause them to question their 'beliefs . ' Two things could happen : 1. the Right -wing zealots will enforce laws making it a crime to put creationism ina poor light , forcing teachers to bow down or be fired . Conservative correctness with the force of law . 2. the Right-wing zealots will realize that their little plan backfired , and let the issue die Scarily , if this should come to pass , if things do not change much politically , I see option 1 as the most likely . During the Cold War , politicians had 'godless Soviet atheism ' to rally against with religious fervor . The Conservatives are now latching onto Fundamentalist Islam as the new 'Red Horde ' . And lots of gullible people are buying into it .

And if you wind up killing somebody with a less-lethal device then you 've got a mess of legal issues facing you . It 's better to avoid such headaches .
Catholics have a different belief . The goal is to always save both mother and child . If the fetus dies during the attempt to save both , then that 's what happens . For instance , with an ectopic pregnancy , the goal is n't to kill he fetus , the goal is to save both mother and fetus .
And the follow-on that Archie throws out there demonstrates his ignorance on the subject . Such laws DO NOT just protect homosexuals . They protect EVERYBODY from being fired just cause they are gay OR straight ( or bisexual or nonsexual ) . It protects the straights just as much as it protects the gays . It has nothing to do with `` better than '' or `` superior '' . If people like Archie understood legislation like ENDA , they would n't try to make such an absurd allegation !
Even if it was murder , do you really expect me to side with the party that broke into Martin 's house and robbed him ?
No biggie , right ? Typical creationist `` teach the controversy '' stuff . But wait ! The `` encyclopedia '' follows this up with it 's damning evidence to show the many holes in the ToE ! Read on evolutionists , and despair ! !
Before you were claiming it was a slippery slope . Now you 're claiming it 's a strawman . Perhaps you do n't understand what either term means .
Oh , it certainly is an issue . Martin Killias , a Swiss criminologist , did find a link between gun ownership and homicide in Switzerland . However , my point was to ask you if you would be willing to abide by such regulations . The law in Switzerland requires that military weapons kept in the home be unloaded and stored under lock and key . I do n't think Switzerland is a gun-nut utopia .

LOL . Bats havent evolved in millions of years
So it 's shifted from `` no new structures '' to `` I can think of a structure that ca n't evolve . '' Me too . Evolutionary theory says that some things are not possible to evolve . But new structures , as you learned , do evolve .
No , but you can have a homosexual aquaintance as the only aquaintance , and thus it would n't be adultry . This would be more likely to happen if gay marriage was legal .
You may not have intended to , but you 've given your carte blanche support for a woman to do what ever with her she wishes , with regards to her family - and you 'd stick out of it , regardless . Also , interestingly , there 's no man in this 'idealy free ' family of yours .
The reasons there are three 'primary ' colors is the fact we have cones that detect those specific wave lengths . There are people with a mutation where they ahve 4 different types of cones ( a duplicate with minor varations of one of the 3 primary colors ) , and they see 4 primary colors
Happenstance origins is my term , taken from two easily definable words . It means origins without intelligence . Origins from random , unguided , natural processes with no supernatural guidance . It is the first of about six different processes that make up the broad term `` evolution '' . It 's a process that any opposition to ID has to have . It ca n't be addressed , and it 's no more or no less scientifically equal to the unaddressed question of where an intelligent designer came from . If the unaddressable consequential steps of one lead to science , then the unaddressable consequential steps of the other equally lead to science .
Actually it is n't . No , really , it is n't ; I 'm not making this up ; I think you 've genuinely crossed a wire somewhere there . Traits are partially described by genes ; they 're the starting point - as you once put it , the 'hard drive ' - but the process of turning genes into an organism is unquestionably influenced by the environment - chemically , thermally etc etc . That 's one reason frogs need so damn many genes while placental animals can get away with a lot fewer : frogspawn have to tolerate such widely varying temperatures during development and need proteins that work correctly at all those temperatures , whereas mammalian foetuses develop in a chemically and thermally regulated environment . Weismann 's barrier says only that hereditary information moves from genes to body cells but never in reverse . The genes provide the starting point , the developmental process - modulated by environmental factors - turns that information into an organism , but there 's no feedback . Retroviruses might constitute a hole in that barrier , which opens up some interesting possibilities . Anyway , the point is , the ToE as it stands does not say , in any shape or form , that genes alone dictate traits and nothing else gets a look in . What it does say is that although the environment can modulate the eventual phenotype during development , it ca n't directly feed back the results of expressing those genes to the genotype . The environment can only have an indirect 'say ' in the genotype of organisms , by allowing some to flourish and inhibiting the success of others . That 's why , in the other thread where we 're discussing the butterflies , I describe the Darwinian process of arriving at environmental sensitivity in the way I do : the environment modulates the phenotype differently in the different seasons ( based on chemical or thermal variation ) and Natural Selection , in this case , is the organisms with genes that consistently yield the 'best ' phenotypes in that variable environment flourishing better . Simmer for a couple of million years and ... well , there you go .
Because our laws say it is a right ...
So let me ask you this ... .how many pregnancies have you had ?
Again , as an ignorant layman , I can only get the gist of this material , but how anyone could possibly argue against the genetic code as a product of intelligent design is beyond me .
'Self-awareness ' is not a strictly objective , scientific term . I recall reading in my college psychology textbooks that the concept labeled 'self-awareness ' does n't happen until many months after birth . At the end of the day , in order to answer the question , I think you 'd need a pretty solid definition of self-awareness , and coming to agreement on what 'self-awareness ' is or should be may not be an easy task . In a strictly biological sense , there is no debate that the biological life of a mammal begins at the point of conception/fertilization . There is no reasonable dispute to this observed fact . Only when subjective terms such as 'self-awareness ' and 'personhood , ' etc . come into play can there be valid debates . Show me a biologist or embryologist who states that the biological development of a unique mammal does not begin at conception/fertilization , and I 'll show you a semantics game . It is perfectly valid for someone to have the opinion that 'life ' begins with recordable brain activity ( as early as 40-days post-conception ) ... or 'self-awareness ' or any other such concept , or when the entity would be 'viable ' outside the womb . But there are varying levels of brain activity . There is no agreed upon definition of self-awareness . And viability is an ever-changing concept ( a 12-week fetus was delivered recently in Minnesota , and as far as I know is still alive and doing well -- please feel free to update me if you have heard any other news ) . If we look to biology to answer the question of when a unique entity begins its biological development that will not end until it 'dies , ' then the answer is conception/fertilization .

That reminds me of the discussion I got into on a `` christian '' board when I referred to a particular pompous XXX as a pompous XXX . I was banned for a week for using profane language . Pointing out that an XXX is an animal and that my remark made sense only in that light was fruitless . My answer was to demand that they ban some versions of the Bible because they told of how Abraham tied his XXX to a tree and Jesus sat on his XXX in Jerusalem . Did n't phase them . They also ignored without comment references to Judge Roy Moore 's monumental erection in the rotunda of the Alabama Supreme Court building . Yanking fundy chains can be so much fun sometimes .

Well , if you do n't want a reaction , I would prefer if you not use the word `` god '' since it is loaded with so many other meanings and conotations than those you say you mean .
I think i disagree with the majority of people that have already posted here . evolution and creationism are mutually exclusive , and the both can not be true at the same time , since there can be only one true way that life originated ( even though i know that `` evolution '' is not the correct term to describe the origin of life , and die-hard evolutionist might chew me out for using it wrongly . I prefer to use the term `` spontaneous origin '' rather than `` evolution '' ) . since creationism and the collection of spontaneous origin theories are mutually exclusive and can not coexist , then upon proving either you automatically disprove the other . and if a 3rd unforseen theory is proven as the real way life originated on earth , then it would automatically disprove the both creationism and the current spontaneous origin theories the 2 concepts are pretty much diametrically opposed right now , both competing for evidence to support its case , and a strengthening of one theory automatically implies a weakening of the other
Our definition of omniscient does not include virtual . That tells me that omniscient means having infinite knowledge .
Well , that just struck a chord with me . People of both sides say , We got the facts ! The facts support our side !  but it isnt about the facts but how we react to them .
None of these alternate views go outside the framework of evolution . They all use poor wording , though , and try to lead one to some conclusion about `` information '' or something .
The laws of physics are short , descriptive statements that describe the operation of certain natural phenomena that always seem to occur in the same way . Many times the `` laws of physics '' have been amended by further information , causing the law to be restated . Actually , I think he meant the way that we have observed the universe and all of nature to operate .
Marriage is a secular condition set up by various Societies over the millenia and one of the prerequisites set out is that such a union should be between people of different genders . Religion has supported this and sanctified it but did not invent it . You do n't curse the Church you lobby Society to see if you can effect a change . People who believe the different gender aspect are entitled to lobby for no change .

Actually it was n't sitting somewhere since there was no `` where '' to `` sit '' and `` always '' and `` eternity '' have no meaning outside of time and no `` time '' existed prior to the `` Big Bang '' , maybe .
Very intriguing .
Well , now this is the question that really matters , and the answer is a long one . But to state it as simply as possible : denying same-sex marriage hurts many people . It forces same-sex couples to pay for the marriage of opposite-sex couples while no one is forced to pay for their marriages . It denies them access to raise children and ability to cover their children and spouses with their medical insurance , along with the many other benefits of marriage . It uses the law to teach the people that the lifestyle and religion held by same-sex couples is wrong , and this forces them to feel the disapproval of society . There is no reason to perpetuate these harms . I have heard many arguments opposed to same-sex marriage , but there is not even one of them that justifies these harms . In fact , I would even say that there is not one argument against same-sex marriage that makes logical sense at all . Thus , even if same-sex marriage brought no benefits , there would be no reason to keep it illegal ; a free and equal society does not deny rights or benefits to anyone , unless it has a very good reason to . And there just is n't any reason to deny rights and benefits to same-sex couples .
I would favor capital punishment IF our system was always fair and equal , it is not ... .. would O.J . have walked if he had been a poor man ? I would support capital punishment if we only convicted guilty men ... that is not the case . The list of men on death row who were found to be innocent and released is long and growing , and we can only guess how many innocents have been put to death . To me the harshest punishment would be to wake up knowing that this day would be like yesterday and tomorrow will be like today - for the rest of my life . Anyone who has had surgery can tell you that being put to sleep with chemicals is absolutely painless . Deterrent ? Do states with the death penalty have a lower murder per capita than those that do ? From a fiscal standpoint , it is cheaper to keep the convicted in prison for life than it is to execute them , and a whole lot easier to correct an error . Will we continue to have state sanctioned revenge ? Probably . Dono
Actually there are already a couple floating around . One fascinating one : Gaia theory and the Daisyworld model . It 's all around self-organising systems and the earth as a self-regulating system/organsism/something or other . James Lovelock and co . Interesting to read but sometimes feels a little too 'lets-all-just-get-along ' to be real , hard-core theory . Either way , it 's probably a lot more likely to be accepted than creationism , should evolutionism for some reason be disproved .
I see , we just keep on adding legs until they match . BTW , they walk on those `` jumping '' legs also . Why are they not refered to as `` Walking/Jumping '' legs . However , if you feel you need to conqure another contradiction , here 's a couple more . How long did Jesus stay ressurected ? Luke says one day , Acts says Forty days . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Using a literal reading and the Gospels , recreate a timeline of the crucifixion of Jesus .
How do you know there is n't a tiger in the bathroom ? You feel very strongly and have over-whelming evidence that there is no tiger in your bathroom ? ( You live in an urban area , there are no zoos , you do n't hear scratching or biting or the maiming of your poodle , and the water is going ) But you can not prove a negative . Which is also why you wo n't be able to prove that creationism is wrong , and why we ca n't prove evolution is wrong . The focus must be on proving one right . How you might do that depends on your method of reasoning and thought .
Look at the DJIA . In the early 30s the economy was starting to turn around . Was it the New Deal ? I 'm willing to accept that . But the economy was about as low as it could go and could go no where else but up . In the years just before WW2 it looked like the economy was about it take another dump . Saying the New Deal saved the country does have some merit , but it is shaky at best . I can say for sure the economic explosion after WW2 was due to massive defense spending .
So sex is only a privelage for those who can phisically give birth ? Abortion is not Black and White as you are trying to paint it to be . It 's much more complicated . Having a baby , even giving it up , causes a lot of emotional and phisical pain , and most people just cant have babys . They can not care for it , and they can not bear to be thinking that their child is out there somewhere . As I have said before , this is much more complicated than you think . Abortion should always be availible in the first and maybe second trimester , so that women wont have to live the rest of their life in fear and abstinence because they can not support a baby . This is an interesting article : http : //www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15173072/site/newsweek/ I would suggest reading it , just to get a better Idea of our position .
Damn , your links sure show a lack of knowledge . Do you have any sources that are n't ignorant as all heck ? While Hoyle came up with the term 'the big bang ' , he was mocking it . Hoyle was a proponent of the Steady State concept of the universe , which he held on to long after it was disproved by empirical evidence . FFS , if you are going to use a source , have one that at least has the history of the theory right ? Yes , the estimated age of the universe changed over time . We got increasingly more sophisticated ways to measure it . In the last 30 years , the age estimate has not significantly changed , but the +/- has narrowed drastically . Do try to use a source that is n't over 30 years old .
The thing is the Dempski did n't provide any kind of testable or detectable definition about what information is either . He used vague but scienficially sounding terms to push his case . He knew it too .

Banning abortion is a tool with which to punish women you deem promiscuous or immoral and recreate through a police state a mythical golden age of christian virtue , got you .

They call it `` lying for baby Jesus '' .

How is that a strawman ? Your challenge directly relies upon something you assume to be proven , but has not been . Therefore even in a hypothetical stance , your underlying arguments are invalid , thus leading to everything else being invalid . You 're not doing so well on this forum .
Well it 's more efficient than the bill we just passed ... I think we agree that much .
( My evidence does not require this quote , it 's for comparison only ) The theory of evolution is based on evidence , the existence of god , is not.. Reason can not be applied to it . Furthermore , since evolution relies on reason , faith can not be applied to it . To attempt to label science as a faith is a contradiction . I know it irks you that your faith can not be proven , but that 's the definition of faith ! ! It would n't be faith without it . As Montalban says in a contradiction of motives : His particular faith does not rest on the foundations of [ reason ] . Why then look for support from reason ?
Do you want to debate this too ? Do you support the 2nd Amendment or do you think exceptions should be made ?

http : //www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CD/CD011.html Radiocarbon dating has been repeatedly tested , demonstrating its accuracy . It is calibrated by tree-ring data , which gives a nearly exact calendar for more than 11,000 years back . It has also been tested on items for which the age is known through historical records , such as parts of the Dead Sea scrolls and some wood from an Egyptian tomb ( MNSU n.d. ; Watson 2001 ) . Multiple samples from a single object have been dated independently , yielding consistent results . Radiocarbon dating is also concordant with other dating techniques ( e.g. , Bard et al . 1990 ) .

OK try the US Constitution . We are a representative democratic republic not a majority rule nation . Majorities hold certain powers but they are limited .

Actually , his definition of evolution is exactly correct . In fact , I notice that you even acknowledge that he is correct in the last sentence of the paragraph .

Some of them know ( from experience , because many nutjob anti-evolutionists are positively dishonest -- like Mathis & amp ; Co. ) that statements have to be phrased carefully for at least one of ( at least ) two reasons : First , these people know a sh*tload less about the technicalities than the interviewers do ; second , words may be chosen more carefully to try to prevent snippets being used out of context . You can see both in this instance , with the explanation of one postulation involving crystals and Dawkins referring to the ultimate Darwinian development of any theoretical panspermia initiators ( which got cut off to be spun into a ridiculous quote mine ) .
again , this is only good as a reasonable assumption , and nothing more . in many cases , the least likely answer is true . you can not create evidence out of assumptions . you test the assumptions against reality , then the assumptions can be confirmed . i agree that reasonable assumptions are useful , but basing an assumption upon another assumption causes the likeliness to decrease . for example , under the assumption that ( a ) jesus is devine , and that ( b ) God exists , it is likely that ( c ) jesus performed miracles . c can only be considered a reasonable assumption of a and b were already true . since a and b are assumptions themselves , then it makes c much more unlikely . as opposed to the case of the footprints . if ( a ) people wear shoes and ( b ) there is a footprint in the lawn , it is likely that ( c ) a person stood on the lawn . in this case , a and b are verifiable , and by they being true , we can consider c a reasonable assumption
Well , what faults ? You say that innocent people are sentenced to death far too often . Well , the death penalty does not sentence people , our judiciary system does . The death penalty is mearly a punishment . I will agree that some innocent people have been sent to death row , and when their innocence was discovered , they were released . A perfect judiciary system would not sentence innocent people , and would alleviate all problems with the death penalty . If we had a perfect system and no innocent person was ever sent to death row , we could take them directy from sentencing to a little room beside the courtroom containing a bed and a few drugs , put an IV in them , and carry out the sentence before the jurors got out of the courthouse . Of course , we know that our judiciary system is an imperfect thing , so we understand the need for appeals .

The purpose of publicizing them is to prevent fraud . If you were n't so intent on trying to bash , you would recognize the obvious distinctions ...
Well let 's put it this way . I really like playing baseball . So I put in a law that says everyone has to play baseball unless they 're in a position where it will threaten their life . Since it 's such a wonderful thing no one should have any problem with a law passed , right ?
So you 're not denying that pro-gun activists in Heller used ( or misused ) the courts to further their own agenda ?
He has a bit more basic information about R.A.T.E . on his webpage . TO also has a page critiquing R.A.T.E . methodology . Sorry , I know you 're looking for more substantial personal feedback , but this is some good basic information that does n't rely upon a billion links . You also might consider asking this question on iidb.org , and maybe Dr. Meert will respond to you personally . More importantly , let us not get hung up on analyzing the raw empirical data only . For example , if I use a stopwatch to time how long it takes for light to flood the room after I turn on the switch , and I come up with 0.06s , you ca n't argue with my empirical data : I timed it at 0.06s . The fact that human response time is comparatively lousy and that a stopwatch is awful for extremely short time intervals is more significant that the stopwatch reading itself . This is the primary error that R.A.T.E . makes .
Would anything convince you ? Do you truly think for yourself ?
Really , did it take long ? ROFL . Did they turn grass into a tree or maybe rice into a tomato ? Got pics ?
No chance . And besides , my Mom still had the same amount of kids , how does this relate ?
the fetus would be a real person ... and it seems like ... .in order to make the iraq war/abortion connection ... .you would have to support the war !
What , to be `` open-minded ? '' or to embrace your definition of `` tolerance ? ''
And speciation , and television programs ... The list is longer than that .
My money is on parents as singular .
Well , it does n't , so it is n't . Biology is well aware that many things have volition , and there are whole branches of biology dedicated to studying it . Animal behavior they call it . However , biology does n't not pretend that every living thing has volition .
That 's HIGHLY debatable . ( unless you meant fights ( fites ? ) the evidence , then I would agree . ) Waxy
There is an answer , and that answer is Truth-based . Of course , for the 99.99999 % of human beings , Truth is not just hard , but impossible .
You prove my point exactly . Just because 99 % of scientists believe in evolution , why should I ? You are right , by catering to evolutionists we are getting behind in our education .
BUt it comes down to gay people being harmed by not being allowed to marry . Any time a group is excluded because of someone elses religious beliefs that group is harmed .
Yep . They 're free to marry a member of the opposite sex just like any other American .
Oh ? You worked on Bowling ? When did the NRA and KKK ever burn a cross together ? Hmmm ? I can take a hint . Just something about that movie tells me Mike Moore is anti-gun . Hey how about Chuck Hestons speech ? Some how I got the impression he gave the speech in Denver ? Did you ? You know the 'from my dead hands speech ' . Anyhow how did Chuck Heston get to wear TWO different suits from one speech ? Anyhow . If Mike Moore of Flint Michigan was behind that counter , would Mike Moore be alive ? Survive with broken facial bones ? Survive with internal injuries ? Or overhelming beat his attacker that he survives unhurt and stopped his attacker ?
thatisnt stupid , its what teh bible says . teh dinosaurs are heavier thatn humans so they sunk and humans foated . the arc protecid the rest ans they died later when humans kiled them tehy still see dinos today in congo so some survivd .
But that pregnancy should be tested in Maternal-Fetal Care Centers . A pregnancy should not be a private life matter anymore . An embryonic person should be registered .
Just so you know Peach , the 167 death row inmates are now serving life in prison . At least that one who 's not guilty might now have a chance to be free .
Well - at least your name is right on .
Well , the point is , you cant . Absent such provability , it is up to both sides to try to decide where they have common ground , or to end the discussion .
** A couple of quick poiints . First , you are very emotionally involved in the materialist/mechanist metaphysic , whether you grasp the full implications of that metaphysic , [ beyond its denial of certain religious mythologies ] , or not . Otherwise you would not so vehemently and tenaciously defend that metaphysic against any suggerstionthatits take on reality , its ontology/cosmoly , is incorrect -- even when , as in the case of EAM , that suggestion comes from a metaphysical quarter that has no ideological connection to any religious mythology , and in fact is also antithetical to those myths .
Hmmm ... interesting . Where does this inalianable right derive from and how does it really work ? I mean , clearly you can not create your own army called Islamic Jihad of Al queda Supporters and start to develop weapons of mass destruction on your own farm , regardless if that organisation actually interfer with someone else . As for bootlicking Please drop the rethorics and explain how you mean instead .
Here is how the exchange went down . Person one . We need to teach morals to our students . Person two . Well if you do that , who 's morals will you teach ? I may disagree . No one could answer that question so they taught no morals . I think we should start by agreeing that things like , but not exclusively , murder , stealing , and hate is wrong . Teach that in which we can agree !
And they have . The only reason you think a fetus is equatable to a human is because it is made of organic matter . What if there was a piece of cardboard in the mothers stomach ? Its non-organic and is in the same mental state as an embryo ( that is , no mental state ) . The only difference is the matter its made out of .
What is the `` Scientific Method '' of evolutionary research in contrast to the `` Scientific Method '' of Creation research ? And why is your method superior ?
kind : Race ; genus ; species ; generic class .
You 're an XXXXX who has obviously never worked ina first responder category . If you think that increasing the volume and social acceptance of drug use to the same level of alcohol will 'solve ' anything , then you are just an XXXXX . You have obviously never seen whart drug abuse does to families and people 's lives . You 're right , alcohol is worse , and the main reason its worse is because of 2 reasons , volume and availability ala social acceptance . Legalizing all drugs would have catastrophic social impacts . Do n't feed me that line about taxing it and using the money for rehab . We have taxed the XXXX out of tobacco and alcohol the last 100 years and the last time I checked alcoholism and lung cancer had n't been erradicated .
Actually , that 's not true . While all of the sciences actually support one another , one can be a chemist and not accept evolution . One can even do good science without accepting evolution , but it is difficult . For example , cosmology , astrophysics and astronomy see a very old universe . That 's not compatible with young earth creationism . Geology finds an old earth , wich is n't compatible with the mythologies of sacred writings . But that is not to say that one can not be a qualified scientist and a deist or a theist . There are lots of good Christian scientists who accept evolution .
No , the `` life ex nihilo '' doctrine of YE also denies God 's word in Genesis .
I believe we have a human responsibility to one another . That we are our brother 's keeper . Tell me , Bassman , if there are n't enough jobs , and the costs of medical care are skyrocketing through the roof , what do you suggest your fellow Americans do ? Just drop dead ?
I wonder how you say `` Ooops '' in Portuguese . If anyone knows , tell jyoshu .
Am i stupid or something ... whats a YEC ? Young Energetic Children ? Yacking Economistic Critters Yummy expensive cupcakes ? Maybe im just dumb or something ... i hope it was one of those three for my sake .
However , if you read Genesis 1 , it is obvious because of the fact that they repeatedly say 'and it was night and day xxxx ' , it means literal days . While it could be 'translated ' to mean another , the fact 'it was night and it was day on the xxxx day ' demonstrates those translations would be dishonest .
And yet quantum physics tends to be very contradictory , at least to our perceptions . Acausal events happen . A particle can be in two places at the same time . A particle can disappear and reappear in a different location without traversing that distance . And et cetera . Since the beginning of our local universe occurred at quantum levels , I would be cautious about drawing philosophical conclusions based on our macro-world experiences .
All things are possible with God . The flood was His judgement on the earth , He created the earth , and therefore He has the power to make what ever He wants to happen happen including make water come out of `` nowhere . '' The Bible describes how water came from both above the earth and from below . My God is the God of the impossible !
You know they are having a fit , and when everyone see 's the streets are n't running red maybe more states will pick it up and follow .
He would probably love the old Egyptian 'hakim ' in 8mm . on the FN action which is about as slick as they come . Turn up the gas pressure a bit and it will fling them foward and to the right and hit about as hard as the bullet Ugly looking suckers but look like a piece of pipe in a single tree from a wagon . Shot some good groups with those things ...
Well , that is your philosophy , which is based on a ( badly made ) foundation of ( inaccurate ) assumptions .
And liquor .
`` attack on the definition of marriage '' ? Why is it an `` attack '' to include gay couples in as married ? Would it be an `` attack '' on something for blacks to not have to be segregated from whites ?
And well he should have ignored it . Your analogy is nonsense .
Oh Good Grief ! It sounds very like you are extremely unsure of your manhood to be so threatened by a funny little story .
Actually , shootings happen because a person points a firearm at someone and pulls the trigger . This is illegal . You ca n't make it more illegal than it already is . Shootings do not happen because of gun happy nuts running around . Nobody has ever been injured anywhere by any gun happy nut running around . Many have been injured by criminals who disobey the law . As far as puncture wounds , do stabbings count ? Or , as it appears , are you only concerned with those caused by firearms ?
Well that 's moronic irony is it not ? Oh and I would n't quote something like that by King since you 'll have a thousand angry locusts descending upon you ... . Just a fair warning ... .
I responded to your posts on the thread of `` Lets discuss the actual ... '' I suggest we continue that discussion there .
Actually , they do . They just do n't want it to leak out . But it 's too late . The cat is out of the bag . Internal documents from the Discovery Institute as well as statements by ID creation proponents from the Dover trial make it quite clear that ID creationism is based on religion and scripture as much as `` creation science '' was .
Did you read the article ? A capuchin is type of monkey , in this case , the type that was used in the experiment .
this is where the most confusion comes in , and why many evolutionist that are particular about the definition of evolution gets into arguments . # 3 is the only one close to the scientific definition , and still this is technically lacking and only serves the very layman level you continue to insist that all misinformation is a result of YEC 's distorting the definitions . YEC 's didnt write the definitions in dictionary.com , noe the hundreds of other dictionarys that have similar definitions . furthermore , your definitions have done nothing to educate people who are seeking more information . they only serve to display your disdain for creationists and your lack of objectivity
It is the lower receiver with the serial number . Everything else on the weapon are 'parts ' .
I think the problem is , some people believe that gun control , any gun control , is one step closer to the total surrender of all guns . My belief on this is that every time someone calls for repeal of gun control laws or opposes the new gun control laws , it fuels the anti-gun extremists to call for the total ban on all guns . If we can not make and enforce common sense gun control laws that both sides can agree on , neither side will ever stop . If a buy back was ever proposed in America , very few guns would be sold . If guns were banned all together , only the law abiding people will give up their guns , and anyone who does not will unfortunately become a criminal .
It 's the first couple of paragraghs from the article in this weeks NS . If you had an online subscription or got a copy from your newsagent you could read the whole thing , unfortunately with this one the intro rambles on a bit and does n't get to the point till the second column ...
On what grounds do you seek to redefine the institution of marriage from it 's accepted standard in this country ?
And that belief in God is further :
uh , yeah , that was their intent ! Under color of law no less . The truth always seems to be your worst enemy does n't it ?
Aggravated assault requires more than a bruise or scratch .
Your use of language is rather colourful here ( lying propagandist ! ) and smacks of hyperbole . What is being critisised here is bad application of the scientific method in relation to National Geographic 's articles on the nature of relationship between birds and dinosaurs . I think Olsen makes some very pertinent points , but at no stage is he saying that evolution does not occur or the possibility that there is no link between any theropods and birds ever . What he correctly draws attention to is poor peer review and less than conclusive evidence to support the hypothesis of the article 's author . In turn this is a stinging criticism of the NG given its high profile , reputation and claim to being a leading forum for the presentation of science in a popular format .
Where 'd Noah get Tasmanian tigers ?
Well , to say it has no mental existence does n't really tell the whole story . The fetus WILL have ( more than likely ) full mental existence in a very short time . It seems to me that if you `` view humanity with mental existance as important '' you 'd also view as important that the unborn baby WILL indeed reach that point , in all likelihood .
And the issue of having separate white and black schools , dining rooms and drinking fountains and bus seats , was only about schools , dining rooms , drinking fountains and bus seats . It was n't an issue about people . Those seats at the back of the bus were just as comfortable as the seats at the front . No need for blacks to complain about being at the back of the bus . They could learn at black schools , and do n't have to be in white schools . Blacks could eat just as well in the `` colored '' dining rooms . They did n't have to be at the `` white '' eating counter . Inter-racial marriage was not about black people , even though they were forbidden from marrying a white person , it was about marriage .
And sometimes , necessary .
This was pretty much my understanding of how natural selection was viewed before Darwin . Nonetheless , I think that my point still stands . Darwin proposed that natural selection is responsible for the diversification of species . This pre-Darwin concept denies this . My understanding is that anti-evolutionists refused to accept that natural selection could have led to the diversification of species . Until recently , when they realized that evolutionary theory could help out in their how-many-animals-could-fit-on-the-ark dilemma ; now they suddenly take an idea from evolutionary science and propose that suddenly all the present species could `` micro-evolve '' from a few ancestral `` kinds '' on the ark .
Well , Nature was einstein 's god . Look at some of his statements
If logic was invented by man that would mean that when people did not exist neither did logic . That does not sound logical to me . Most people believe there is life eleswhere in the universe ( I 'm not saying I do but I just want to illustrate a point ) . If logic was invented by man does that mean aliens elsewhere in the universe do not have logic to guide them ? Just a question . `` In Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge . '' ( Colossians 2:3 )
I think the answer to that is much like J.P. Morgan 's famous retort when someone asked him how much his yacht cost . 'If you have to ask , you ca n't afford it ' . I 'm not saying someone uninterested in different weapons could n't afford them , but if the interest is n't already there , it 's doubtful any explanation would provide an answer to your particular question .
The quality of life ethic is far different from sactity/dignity of life ethic . A quality of life ethic carried out to its logical conclusions does not promote a pro-life society . Instead , there would be genocide against the handicapped , elderly , and people who people of power have deemed life unworthy of life . The problem with this ethic is that it is centered in arbritrary people deciding arbritarily which person passes the `` quality of life '' test .
I see results . I see lakes in the middle of continents with no rivers leading to them . How did they get there ?
Said the troll that lives in the UK
But maybe god does not hate gays , maybe he just hates the ones that demand to have sex with people whether they want it or not .
Yet the very seat of Catholicism glorifies one of the absolute WORST offenders Explain .
How would I fill in some of the gaps ? Here was my sequence : something like unicellular life to multi-cellular life , random multi-cellular conglomerations to an amoeba , to a fish , to a dinosaur , to a mammal , to an ape , and finally to a man ? ?
yea but ToE does n't say mammals evolved from sponges -- it says we evolved from reptiles .
And he would do all these things because he had watched the Discovery channel , not because he is inherently bright enough to deduce from first principles that flint and stone make sparks , that dried vegetation can be burned , why burning vegetation might be a good idea or that fire even exists . You are gifting your human with a huge quantity of social DNA that billions have lived and died to accumulate .
But why ? What is so important about an embryo that it can be given a `` person '' status ?
Your appeal for help did n't work
But , it is a new TYPE of butterfly . It would be more like if a bonobo and a human had a child . That is theorotically possible ...
Congratulations . You are now part of a minority group . Marriage tends to either work or it does n't . I know , brilliant observation . What I mean is either the couple is together for decades or spend x amount of years being unhappy until the unhappy is more than the baggage of divorce .
Hmmm ... so , barren women can not have a valid point of view nor women in the stage of menopause because it does not affect them personally . Perhaps you should tell the moderator to institute women only Forums , men only Forums , gays only Forums . etc
Maybe you need to take a hard look at where your rights start infringing on the rights of others . A pretty good case ? Dream on . Sure , you have the rigth to take the morning after pill . you do not have the right to force another individual to sell you that pill , any mroe than you have the right to walk into your local ford dealer and demand that they provide your with a chevy . Its just not the way the world works . People can go to another pharmacy or , not . It really does ntoy matter . Retail establichments are able to decide fro themselves what they carry , the governemtn has no place in such decisions . If they decide not to carry the pill , or the pharmacist simply decides they are not going to dispense it , that is their right . It is entirely an issue between employers and their employees and witht he The American Pharmacists Associations policy that allows pharmacists to refuse to fill presciptions on moral grounds , it is hardly an issue there , either .
how many animals do you think were on the Ark ? how many species existed at the time ? the story of the ark does not coincide with contemporary science , but it does work with the rest of Genesis . this is Genesis 2 : 15-23
Well , thank you for this thread Santafeur . I must say though that I peruse various threads just to read stuff . The C vs. E topic does not strike a nerve with me . In fact , I also wonder what it is about the human mind that makes people so desperate to want to know how we came about . What difference does it make ? We are here now . Could we possibly just accept that we got here somehow , and just move on ?
Very , very slowly , latterly from something almost like a cell , and before that from something a bit less like a cell , and so forth . The cell is not an irreducible organic 'atom ' , and did not have to spring into existence in one go .
But then , there also is absolutely no evidence for such an intelligence .
You 're giving them waaaaay too much credit . All of these amendments were prepared and supported by the same national organizations working with local groups . They 've heard the arguments about how broad these laws are and have n't changed a single one . They know exactly what they 're doing . In a few cases , after assuring people that they did n't intend to interfere with domestic partnership legislation , they filed suits to do exactly that once the amendment passed .
I do n't see how one can be a agnostic and be a Deist either . Deism requires a origin , some form of a clockmaker . To not be sure that such a being exists is to fail one of the most basic ideas of Deism .
Its very sad to me that we have to brake the bondage of religion . I thought we did that ? I was wrong . We under siege , from something horrible . One thing this horror is not , its not from God . Jesus could not follow fundamentalism , he couldnt do it . Yet the monsters head rises again and so we must address the lies and twists this creature wants to chain us with . If we as nation are forced to obey this Dragon called fundamentalism ; our children will be drinking blood and casting out demons from foreign lands all their lives . Nothing is more terrible or sinful than a Dogmatic man thinking he is doing the will of a God . Families have sacrificed ( and are ) their Children and drank the cool aid of the false Prophets . We have no choice anymore . We can not allow 2000 year old texts to be a literal book of guidance for a country our fathers fought to keep free . Dont give up your fight , use logic and literary knowledge to tear down their straw houses . Use their book . Read it once and see what it says . The concepts in it actually destroy it . Its failures in logic are easily shown as even laughable . Only then can man kind God . Secularism allows for such liberty . Church and Church states never will .
Oh I hated being pregnant . However I am not really arguing whether pregnancy in and of itself is punishment , I suspect that is an opinion matter - there are some crazy women who actually liked pregnancy . Julie - however clearly feels that it is acceptable to use a pregnancy and parenting in a punitive matter against women she feels are irresponsible .
Hello there , Your ignorance is showing concerning both history and anthropology . We Neanderthals were the first humans to recognize the existence of the soul and the afterlife . We were the first to bury our beloved dead with personal articles , still valuable and quite usable to the living , but because they belonged to those we loved , we buried such items with them . You obviously were never taught that and never sharp enough to learn for yourself , but hey , that 's nothing new from someone from the Left . Symbol over substance is your mantra and shall no doubt , so remain . Cheers from the Rockies
Again , it 's not just 'evidence ' but 'evidence constructed into a workable theory ' .
http : //www.thelizlibrary.org/liz/004.htm Normal , frequent or expectable temporary side effects of pregnancy : * exhaustion ( weariness common from first weeks ) * altered appetite and senses of taste and smell * nausea and vomiting ( 50 % of women , first trimester ) * heartburn and indigestion * constipation * weight gain =snip=
this is a rant . no argumentative value . its cool that he 's a curator of birds though interesting that one of the main goals of creationist scientists is to first discredit science by any means necessary . once they accomplish that in their audience , they proceed to show how they apply science to strengthen their case for creation . a very interesting approach , i must say
This should be in the science section , not the CvE section . Do n't give SS any more reason to believe that the big bang is part of biology .
And the religious have killed many millions more because the others did not believe in the `` right '' God .
Yes , you do have a problem with Archaeopteryx . You ca n't explain it from a creationist point of view . I 'm not claiming that it is a `` link , '' whatever that may be . It is a transitional form . It is a small theropod dinosaur that has characteristics that are common to theropod dinosaurs and only theropod dinosaurs and their ancestors . It also has characteristics that exist in birds and only birds . Some characteristics exist in both . The furcula , for example . A furcula has been identified in some theropods , but it is rather rare and then only imprefectly preserved . An indication that it may be mostly connective tissue . Archaeopteryx has a furcula . But even at that it does n't compare to the same structure in birds . It is intermediate . Imagine that !
You say that alot but discussion is about taking other people seriously .
Now you 're talking .
And you , on the other hand , because you are not educated in science in general , and evolutionary theory ( why the quotation marks ? ) specifically , are qualified to correct those of us who spent years in study of the topic .
Just different ones . He does n't have to endure the pregnancy , f.ex .
But apparently Bush was dating her . I do n't think on the medical form they ask who you are dating . And is there any actual proof that it was his child that he aborted ? I want to see the test results on that . If that is indeed true , it was a very big mishap for Bush . But I am not voting for him because he claims he is not pro-choice . I am personally pro-choice myself ( in certain cases ) .
Except it 's not . It 's perfectly acceptable to morally disagree with drinking and smoking ( and encourage others not to do it ) and still believe others should have the freedom to choose for themselves . chloe ,
Being pregnant is a health condition now ? Or is it the most natural condition in life since it is life begetting life . You ignorant feminists want it both ways as you now worry about a baby getting an invitro shock as you promote , endorse and defend the brutal and violent murder of 1.4 MILLION BABIES each and every year in America alone . And you will have the nerve to call me a hypocrite in this very post ?
He was n't discussing abortion nor was He promoting it . He was declaring war on an unclean people whom He commanded the Jews to wipe out in a time of WAR . Again you rip an event out of context and attempt to imply God was endorsing abortion .
Absolute nonsense . Bird bones are very strong and offer the added advantage of being light . According to your logic birds should be extinct and unable to do anything .
Seriously ? That 's your reasoning ? By such logic , swimming with sharks means that humans always have coexisted with sharks , including the ancient ones that preceded the dinosaurs . By such logic , since humans can coexist with insects , we must have been around during the carboniferous period .
So indignities offered our citizens will be tolerated if dispensed in small doses ? Maybe we might educate the pirates what they should `` know better '' than to try . My taxes pay to have a Navy presence around the world . Americans are American interests .
Anti-Abortion Hi , I 'm brand new to this forum but not to abortion debates . I have been active in abortion debates for almost 20 years now . ( not bragging , just providing some background ) I started `` online '' debating even before the internet was available to the general public . We used a direct dial BBS called `` FIDONET . '' ( look it up on Wikipedia ) I used to be `` pro-choice '' with regard to elective abortion . and the legality thereof . I was of the ( seemingly very common ) belief that many people express ; `` I would n't personally want my child aborted , .. but who am I to tell a woman what she can and can not do with her body ? '' Sound familiar ? Long story , short ? My views started changing in 1989 when an up and coming radio talk show host issued a challenge . He ( Rush Limbaugh ) said that he believed that `` a persons life ( rights ) begins at and by their conceptionm , , , and he wanted someone to prove to him that it can possibly begin any other way . '' ( I despised Rush Limbaugh ) That challenge began my education process on the many abortion aspects and issues ... and I have been actively involved ever since . I have already read through several of the threads ( including this one ) in this forum and I 'm looking forward to participating , ... and possibly incorporating it into my website . ChuzLife.net ( under construction )
You know Brady , you 've said a lot of stupid stuff over the years . I even remember finding a post of yours where you said all guns and gun owners should be registered , but sex offenders should n't be . This latest post of yours is just another senseless and stupid rambling of somebody that 's so hateful and fearful of an inanimate object that it 's impossible for him to function in our society and can barely handle his own needs .
It 's quite obvious that it 's the ID proponents who have issues with definitions , particularly among themselves . Behe has changed his own definition of IC , and Dembski changed Behe 's definition of IC .
Yes . Oddly , the picture makes as much sense as most creationists .
Sure . Here is an explanation . The 14C Method That is from the Radiocarbon WEB info site by the Waikato Radiocarbon Dating Lab of the University of Waikato ( New Zeland ) . That 's how I think it works , so the ball in in your court now .
well yes that 's what he did , but he did not try to present this as positive evidence for anything . the biomorphs were used to illustrate the point that random mutations are much more likely to produce beneficial results when the mutations are small . analogies always break down at some level , this analogy was used to illustrate a certain point . the assertion that dawkins was suggesting that a biomorph happening to look like a real life object were proof that evolution and natural selection could produce such creatures is false . montalban , to restore integrity i suggest you retract the conclusion you drew from snippets and quotes from dawkins as your paraphrasing was clearly not representative of dawkins ' ideas .
And she was having unprotected sex ? So she knew becoming pregnant was a possibility ? Yeah , I could see that being condemned by pro-lifers .
So that is your opinion of humanity ? How sad . Or maybe your are erecting a strawman and not doing a very good job of knocking it down .
Oh I 'm so sure that 's the case . `` Well the economy 's at the worst I 've ever seen and I do n't have a job and ca n't possibly provide a living for my family and we 're in danger of losing our house and living on the streets , but I do n't think I 'll save us all a lot of pain and agony because I do n't have a gun meaning that it 'll just be too much work to kill ourselves . '' Yeah right , like a lack of having a gun would 've kept this family from dying in this instance . Your comments cheapen the value of life .
No Montalban , fallacy or falsity will not persuade me to think a true claim is false . Your faith can not differentiate truth from falsity , so we can not use your faith-based evidence , since it always results in circular reasoning , and ultimately , contradiction . If you wish to support your refutation with logical or justified evidence , please do . You have not . I make no such claims about the unknowable . I have claimed , that your claim , is illogical : =============================== Defined : Unknowable : not knowable www.cogsci.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/webwn - based on Law of Contradiction A proposition can not be both true and false . Is it knowable ? No , by definition , it 's unknowable . False Is it knowable ? You claim you know it . True Knowable : Not Knowable . The claim - I know something of the unknowable - Is a logical contradiction . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Your claim remains contradictory , despite your anger and frustration and assumptions about me . -Mach
Oh , he does n't want abortion , huh ? If you take the Old Testament to be true , you just lied here . Let 's look , shall we ?
No offense , but I am in my early teens and understand the situation more than you .
And the same people that believe that are the ones that keep saying that teaching about alternative lifestyles is n't . BTW , Woodhaven is in my neck of the woods . Everyone here in Michigan has guns , especially the criminals .
Why do people on the pro-gun side continuously try to oversimplify the issue ? No one is really arguing that there would be zero murder without guns . The question is would there be less murders without guns . In developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders . At any rate , I do n't think you can draw such conclusions based on one incident .
It seems that the high priest of Global Warming is so unconcerned about its reality that In the past year , Gores home burned through 213,210 kilowatt-hours ( kWh ) of electricity , enough to power 232 average American households for a month . http : //news.newsmax.com/ ? SKIDYNyQ-GW ... mo_code=6539-1
And where , pray tell are you pulling THIS strawman from ?
epaphras_faith , as I was just saying , Science has laready defined the exact nature of the difference ( i.e . having to do with a specific definition of the word `` conscious '' ) . However , the damn definition would take a while to study , before anyone could hope to paraphrase it ! We keep redefining the difference , as the years and studies go on . It 's just become too damn difficult for any layman to remember what the damn difference is ! LOL ! ! ! BTW ... . Someone above mentioned fear of death . That too is not specific to humans . Chimps and even lower ranking animals like birds have specific warning signs for specific dangers , and when you see a troop of 40 baboons scamper up a tree so fast that they leave some hair behind , you can pretty much bet that they fear death from a snake , or a large predator , and did n't all get hungry for tree bark or leaves , at the same time . So , I think fear of death can be ruled out as being specific to humans .
False and irrelevant . How about you correct your position and support your claim with justification rather than just rambling on with rhetoric about what I do and do not understand ?
Yet another anti-Christian post by a gay activist .
Well there 's a new Covenant / Testament . But Jesus declared all foods clean so you can have your pork . Check for trichinellas , which is probably one reason it was n't on God 's preferred list in those unsanitary times . Recommended study for you : Investigate the different kinds of laws ( i.e . moral , civil / tort , ceremonial , dietary ) . Then look at how these issues are treated in the NT .
Then their arguments are based on sheer ignorance .
If something is conceptual , that by definition means it was conceived by the human mind . That 's what a concept is . I think that simply ends the discussion . Concepts are of human construction and thinking . Logical constructs are absolute only to the extent that they were designed that way .
Looks like you 're not asking for objections to the conclusions and analysis this time around , like you were here . I guess it is wise only to argue on the grounds you know your opponent will find the most irritating or difficult . At any R.A.T.E . ( ha ha ha ... ) , I 'll repeat the objections raised on the old forum , which move to doubt the sufficiency of the empirical data : From http : //www.creationresearch.org/crsq ... 1_1/Helium.htm : `` Thus our new diffusion data support the main hypothesis of the RATE research initiative : that God drastically accelerated the decay rates of long half-life nuclei during the earth 's recent past . '' The empirical data is missing , Zero . The problem with the empirical data in support of the above statement , is that it does not exist .
My thought is , do n't treat editorials as if they were sources of facts . I went to the CRU website , and their home page has a graphic showing definite warming over the time period in question . http : //www.cru.uea.ac.uk/ Bob Carter , the guy who wrote your editorial , is either a fool or not above lying to make a point . The world is clearly getting hotter , all the data supports this . It 's not like we 're talking rocket science here . All this takes is reading a thermometer and writing down the results , which is a task that people have mastered for quite some time now . Anyone who tells you that we are n't heating up is either in denial , or in the pay of someone who does n't want to be told to stop polluting .
Spot the difference between reading a book and carrying a gun . I 'm sorry if you ca n't . People do n't carry books because they 're worried about being assailed by someone with an eraser .
This claim might be true , but do you have any citations about Carl Burgh 's fraudulent claims ? ( ps I note you do n't tell everyone else to go look up a book ! It 's nice to feel special ) I know of this site http : //home.austarnet.com.au/stear/carl_baugh_page.htm which makes the claim , but I 'd be interested to learn more about this alleged fraud
I 'm afraid you 're wrong , as I created you in my universe , and implanted in you a belief that you were a god . It lead you to make statements about the truth of your own beliefs , which I 'm afraid are just self-beliefs with no real evidence . Sorry .
And just what is rule 3a
This whole thing is simply an epistemological argument , for which there is no answer . What is the nature of knowledge ? There are positivists ( Abe here ) and there are constructivists ( what Abe says you have to be if you do n't believe in god . ) This is a metaphysical debate that is decades old and it simply depends upon your point of view for the purpose of the discussion at hand .
I did n't think they would have the guts after getting slapped so badly last time out . I mean , there is loosing a case , and then there is getting kicked up and down the street and dragged through a field of tacks , which is pretty much happened when last time out .
And I would like to know why that is . I asked the question in post # 2 and got no answer . Are laypersons lacking in intelligence so much that its hopeless for them to be on the same communication level with scientists ? Since they share the same society , put their pants on one leg at a time in the same way , eat , sleep , and share economic processes in comparable ways , it seems to me it would be beneficial for them and laypersons both to understand each other when they use identical terms . ( like the word , theory )
Ah , yes , a return to the redefinition of ' ( un ) natural ' . Fair enough - it 's using the Bible to support a viewpoint , but that 's kinda what creationism is I guess . From the 'scientific ' creationist view , the challenge would be to then prove that humans have never undergone 'micro'evolution . Especially given the various mutations and differences in humans today - from minor differences like height and hair colour to more major differences like minor variations in bone structure ( often racial differences ) to the most extreme differences like varying number of appendages ( see the 'two-toed ' tribes ) . But you 're right - I guess that the traditional response would be 'the bible says this , so reality must be wrong ... '
Argueing with penfold is like wrestling a pig in the mud , the pig enjoys it .
And you still have provided no evidence .
Well , at least you realize that . Just the way some apes became humans and some became chimps .
A taste of what could be our future if the left has its way .
So , I guess you did n't get the memo that this country was FOUNDED on Christian/Judaic beliefs . Remember : You do have rights ; to an extent .
Or perhaps Mach just does n't understand the concept of an 'analogy . ' No one was claiming they want 'rights restricted ' because of of bathrooms . He 's either being beligerent by intentionally portraying the analogy as a premise , or incredibly dense . I 'm starting to wonder if it 's the latter . . . .
So if ID theory did this , you 'd accept it ? Or are you against hunting for the truth ?
NO PERMIT IS REQUIRED IN VIRGINIA ! You can legally carry a firearm there if you are legally allowed to own one . Virginia performs an FBI background check and issues a permit UPON REQUEST for those who would like the convenience of carrying in another state that does require a permit . This statistic is just those who have requested one ! Imagine how many people who lawfully carry THAT HAVE NOT requested one ! I would imagine the number of folks legally carrrying is WAY more that those who have went through the trouble of filing a request . Yet , in THREE YEARS , people who lawfully carry a gun have `` killed '' 107 people ? OOOOOOH ! Wow ! So us legal carriers have committed one tenth of one percent of all gun `` killings '' ? ( Notice they do n't say if these are justified or not . ) Just to see how that looks - - - .01 % - - There . That 's how it looks : .01 % . It 's obvious why they do n't compare this statistic to the average for the percentage of `` killings '' by the rest of the population who do n't even carry guns . Because it would show that `` killings '' by people who do n't even carry guns outnumber `` killings '' by those who do by a HUGE margin . The VPC ca n't have that now , can they ? When you show the ENTIRE statistic , it makes gun carriers look SAFER than the regular population . The HORROR ! It would mean the VPC 's point of view would be ... .uh ... .WRONG !
Hold up , your changing your argument . You said `` I have never been accosted by an armed assailant . Hence , I see no reason I need to carry a concealed handgun in order to be brave enough to move about my hometown . `` . This is the reason you gave for not carrying a firearm , I was simply countering that argument because it did n't sound very logical to me , still does n't . As to your new statment , I 'll need more info . What do your consider an `` accidental discharge '' of a firearm . I ask because I do not consider someone pulling the trigger to be `` accidental '' and therefore I consider true accidental discharges to be pretty uncommon . Yes , for most people I think the chances of being in a car accident are greater then the chances of needing a gun for self defense . But , I 'm not sure why that would make a difference . If it was reversed I would still where my seatbelt . God Bless
You can not create the general from the specific , only the specific from the general
They need to keep their opinions to themselves and out of the law the effect gay peoples lives . I see nothing wrong with locking up those who incite hatred towards gay people just as we lock up people who shout fire in a crowded theatre .
Again Monty has shown that he does n't bother to learn what he is talking about before he speaks . It is not true that science has `` found '' the mitochondrial Eve , nor is it true that it shows that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human population . Both ideas are ridiculous in the extreme . The mitochondrial ( note spelling monty ) Eve is a mathematical concept . If the estimates of the mutation rate of mitochondrial DNA are correct , then she lived about 200,000 years ago or so . And of course , the variation in human populations is carried by the nuclear DNA , not the mitochondria . High school biology students know this . And , of course , recent analysis has shown that every gene in the human genome has an average of 14 alleles . Since a single person can carry only two alleles of any gene , monty 's assertion becomes pure nonsense . Hank says :
Actually its one of the oldest gun laws on the books . The Sullivan Act , also known as the Sullivan Law , is a controversial gun control law in New York State . Upon first passage , the Sullivan Act required licenses for New Yorkers to possess firearms small enough to be concealed . Possession of such firearms without a license was a misdemeanor , carrying them was a felony . The possession or carrying of weapons such as brass knuckles , sandbags , blackjacks , bludgeons or bombs was a felony , as was possessing or carrying a dagger , `` dangerous knife '' or razor `` with intent to use the same unlawfully '' . Named for its primary legislative sponsor , state senator Timothy Sullivan , a notoriously corrupt Tammany Hall politician , it dates to 1911 , and is still in force , making it one of the older existing gun control laws in the United States . Many believe the act was to discriminate against immigrants in New York , particularly Italians , as the first person arrested under the law was mobster Giuseppe Costabile . Whether this was part of the law 's intent , it was passed on a wave of anti-immigrant rhetoric as a measure to disarm an alleged criminal element . The police granted the licenses , and could easily discriminate against `` undesirable '' elements . Sponsor `` Big Tim '' Sullivan reputedly desired the law so that his criminal cohorts could go about their activities unimpeded by citizens defending themselves with concealed handguns . It was used against political enemies by dropping a small pistol into an overcoat pocket . Thus having them arrested and put in jail for violation . Big Tim stepped in front of a speeding subway train .
Oh , right . And what would yours be ? `` We the humble people of the human species have decided to break away from Britan rule and form our own bubble community . No one has any rights whatsoever , and we restrict our citizens to living in bubbles because we cherish each life , from skin cells to bacteria to plants to embryos . In fact , we really have no purpose in life , we just life to not kill other lives .
All I know is Obama and Biden both have a bad history of voting agains law abiding gun owners , if they are given a gun ban bill to sign , they will almost certainly sign it .

And how do you propose to settle this once and for all unless you admit that in order for the egg and the sperm to come together and form a child in 9 months that original life existed within each of them . Not only that , but the resulting offspring is a combination of the features and characteristics of the two parents who copulated . To imply that an unborn child is not human/a person simply because it is n't fully developed is to also claim that a person born without limbs must not be human either because they too are incomplete human beings .
There may very well be such things near you , but at the time I knew of none near me - besides the fact that the actual cost was just one of the many factors .
The Brady Bunch are going to work that mentally incapacitated/incompetent stuff to the best of their ability .

Just because someone believes in Evolution , it does n't make them an atheist . Maybe you should realize that both forms of thinking could be correct . Some of us are smart enough to form our own opinions and not follow everyone else .
That interpretation is fine except that God says , `` I WILL make a helper suitable for him . '' He had n't made the animals yet in verse 18 , but he created Adam in verse 7 .
What is so sacred about this type of `` information '' that it can not be produced randomly ?
Oh , is THAT where you are getting your anti-evolution information : The Biotic Message ? I read the book tens years ago and eventually sold it because it was n't worth keeping . You do know that it is a book dealing with biology that was written not by a biologist , but by an engineer ... right ? Walter James ReMine is a mere engineer of some sort , and has no degree in biology . And gee whiz , biologists do n't agree with ReMine ... how strange ! : - ) PS : I even had a few exchanges with ReMine himself when I was posting at ARN . I argued against him , even though I was an IDist at the time , because he was not being truthful .
Because no new information is added to the genome ? Well , it 's wrong , but interesting . It did n't change whether I thought you were nuts .
No , but they were used for burial .
You know what ? You 're starting to remind me an awful lot of reverend Jackson and reverend Phlaeger ( the one who said they were going to kill anyone that did n't support their ideas of gun control ) . The claimed that a gun shop owner was intentionally violating the laws of Chicago and selling all kinds of weapons to gang members , simply by being one mile outside of the Chicago city limits . Your entire argument is that since there are firearms dealers within a certain distance to the Mexico/America border , then they must obviously be outfitting the mexican drug cartels . You 've hung yourself with this article you just posted , and I 'm gon na explain why . The ATF has said there are 6,700 licensed dealers along the border , meaning they know exactly where they are . So why exactly is n't the ATF going in there and breaking them up for their illegal activities ? After all if close proximity is an unquestionable sign of guilt , then the ATF must know that these guys are equipping mexican drug cartels with fully automatic machine guns ( the kinds that the American people ca n't ever get ) and grenades and rocket launchers , and maybe even the odd nuclear warhead . The ATF shut down Red 's Trading Shop on matters as insignificant as typos . So why are n't they going in and shutting down these rogue dealers if they 're doing anything wrong ? It 's illegal to own an automatic weapon of any sort without a federal tax stamp , and it 's not possible for civilians to own post-'86 model automatic weapons , so why is n't the ATF doing something about it if they 're breaking the laws ? Seriously Aussie , what is it , is the ATF saying `` We know they 're breaking the laws , but they 're not doing anything illegal we can bust them on '' ?
I know you do n't . So what ?
Er , no . That is AnswersinGenesis ' reasoning . Are you having difficulties reading ? It seems so , as you are unable to distinguish between what a poster says and what an organization they are quoting says .
The issue of whether or not gay marriage is a 'human ' / 'civil ' right is begging the question ...
Yes , and she 's prolife now , but the basis of the ruling is still the same , and even if it were overturned it would n't be too long before another case went to court . The question is would it get the same ruling ? Probably yes , there had been a change of opinion due to change in justices than they would have found reasons to overturn it already , since they have n't they most likely agree .
Well played ! I guess when someone does nothing but spout lies , all that baloney finally catches up in the form of embarassing contradiction ...
I do not empathise with an embryo or early fetus the way I imagine I would with my late-term fetus or born child . I fully intend to have children in the future , including through adoption possibly . When I do I will love them with all my heart and put their needs above my own . I 'm not going to do a half-assed job of parenting ; I 'll give it 100 % . But not yet . Prototype :
Lurch , I do n't appreciate your condescending tone . If you want to challenge my assertion that you are a pompous XXX that jumps to conclusions , you will need to be a little less judgemental and start thinking outside of Darwin 's Black Box .
But here I slam into my own brick wall , one which neatly intersects my path down your chain of reasoning . Biological systems are simply orders of magnitude more complex than any other chemical processes because they are , by definition , autocatalytic-with-errors systems , which is a giant leap in terms of potential , in terms of the variety of future system-states that can be generated . But it is still possible to model these system-state trajectories in terms of probability , which is where chaos theory and emergence come in . To bring myself to a close , I return to my original point . The concept 'emergence ' is a human-imposed concept that can be easily described , if you so wish , as new information arising in a system ex nihilo . But it is equally easily ( and more precisely ) described as a rearrangent of a system 's information in a way that is specifically unpredictable . That is what emergence is . There is no 'energy ' created ex nihilo . There is no 'matter ' created ex nihilo . The only thing that seems to be created ex nihilo is that sudden realisation within the human mind that the patterns of information have drastically changed in a way that redefines the entire system . This is why maths is essential , because the maths shows that the system has merely been reorganised , albeit radically . It is such radical restructuring of information that I suspect gives rise to apparent consciousness . As I have said before , I do not deny consciousness , and I do prefer to think that it is real . But I do not assume that it is anything but apparent when I am making analytical judgements , and I can not begin to imagine how you come to the conclusion that organisms such as bacteria possess it when they specifically , are quite obviously and evidently , no more than fiendishly complex micromachinery . With mammals it 's another story .
Cthulhu may go too far in his/her assumptions about the indecision of pro-life people , but his scenario does bring up an interesting challenge . I 'm sure that it was never meant to be presented as a realistic scenario - that was not the point . The point was to try to make pro-life people admit that the baby is more worthy of consideration than the newly fertilized zygote . Your example of choosing between ones mother and a stranger is equally unrealistic for most of us but does not address the same type of question ( the question in that case being how much worth one places on personal connections in deciding the worth of a person ) . There are occasional situations in life where one is faced with choosing between two awful choices and one can only choose the lesser of two evils . Those type of situations can be quite interesting since they reveal to us our priorities and details of our moral reasoning . I remember being comfronted with the too-many-people-on-a-lifeboat scenario ( so how does one decide who lives and dies ) during comfirmation years back - again to force us to explore our moral reasoning . Cthulhu 's scenario may be an unrealistic one but would force someone who is pro-life to consider the relative worth of the baby vs zygote . It may be a very uncomfortable question ( all of the lesser-of-two-evils questions are ) but can be quite revealing . Given that introduction , if you or other pro-life people were faced with that awful choice , would you : 1 ) Consider both so exactly equally worthy that you would indeed be frozen in indecision , or possibly decide based on chance ( a flip of a coin ) 2 ) Choose one over the other based on moral considerations Note : I believe it would be obvious to almost everyone that your choosing one over the other does not mean that you condone the killing of that other . It would be just a choice of the lesser of two evils , where it is acknowledged that both choices , in your view , would be evil .
Or that they tend to be better prepared , or even less willing to accept help from others or get breakdown cover . That 's the trouble with these kind of stats , the interpretations are pretty open to debate .
Marilyn - I 'll look at your site if you look at mine ... http : //www.nra.org/
Blah , blah . So you looked something up . Adds nothing .
I know that there was a time that America wanted slavery . I know that there was a time that America wanted women to be inferior . I know that there was a time when America wanted to ( and did ) kick out atheists . But I do not care what America wants . I care what helps the most people . And if America wants to help the most people , then I do not mind letting it . But to suggest that it is a good thing to allow the majority of Americans to vote on how many rights the minority gets is to ignore the reality of the tyranny of the majority . To hear you speak on monarchy , it sounds to me that you believe slavery , women 's sufferage , segregation , or any past instance of tyranny of the majority was fixed by a majority vote of the people . But in reality , it was the national-level government officials and the judges who came to the aid of the minority , not the majority . And the majority disapproved of those decisions until they were replaced by a younger generation . Our Constitution is designed to give ulitmate power to the people but to prevent them from making decisions themselves . It is designed to allow them to decide which individuals make the decisions , but the majority does not get to make those decisions . Our Constitution gives the majority vote no power except the power to decide who is elected ( in fact , it originally gave legislators the power to elect the Senate , not the people ) . It certainly gives the majority vote no power to change the Constitution . It does this because any one person or group can not be trusted with power . The majority will abuse its power as surely as anyone else will , even if that majority is well-intentioned , and the majority will be held accountable to no one . The majority should never be trusted to decide the rights of the minority , and I think that is the most important thing I can say .
But when some are ignorant enough to believe in a false science like evolution , which is based on lies and deceptions , they prove right there that they have n't enough knowledge of the truth , nor a sense of discernment that is capable of even determining what is true or a lie . So who are you people to even judge the intelligence of those who will ultimately be proven to have known the truth regarding our origins , to the lies that you so proudly defend ? I say this only so you pseudo intellectuals will have some personal introspection to consider rather than just assuming that you 'll get the correct answers by leaning on human understanding . It is incredible that you ca n't even see that you are bankrupt when you rely on unprovable assumptions that are based on preconceived notions , that have been both failing and conflicting with all of the new discoveries made in each generation to follow , thereby forcing the need to redefine the parameters by which evolution works every 10 years or so . So evolution is n't a science , it 's a working piece of fiction in progress that is constantly being tweaked and shaped to fit the preconceptions no matter what new evidence is discovered that contradicts it .
As long as it resides within said woman - you bet . Kind of like you get to decide the rules for your house and who you are gon na let in the door OR throw out when they become detrimental to your household in some way .
So what ? The allele frequency , even in your example has still changed . A change in an allele frequency in a population over time is , by definition , evolution . What did you think that evolution was ?
Well , if you were a herbavore it might be a good place to temporarily store plant matter to allow bacteria to break it down so that nutrients would be available to you . But of course you are n't and so it is neither good nor bad until infected . Well , actually it 's good since it does seem to have a role in the immune system , a role that is shared with the rest of the small intestine . But the small intestine has a different , more obvious role too .
So it is claimed .
So ? ? ? ? Are we supposed to be surprised ? Hardly State constitutions and / or their amendments do n't mean diddly squat if they are not in agreement with the US cconstitution .
Yeah they were . Mostly killed by criminals with guns . Now prove that any legislation that Obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths . I 'm not holding my breath and I 'm not expecting a rational response either ...
So what ? That means in a firefight with police , the criminal will run out of ammunition in a matter of seconds and be ripe for the picking .
Read THIS slower :
Just to follow suit - note the bolded : What do you mean everyone knows who made everything . If that were true then there would be no religious differences throughout the world , no theological discussion , no theory of evolution , no need for this thread . As for your assertion that evolution is random/accidental , you are , yet again , making a false statement ( either through ignorance or deliberate falsehood ) . Mutation is random , natural selection done by waiting to see which mutation makes survival ( and propagation ) more likely . There will also be random events such as natural disasters , ice-ages , droughts etc which do introduce a bit of random luck into the equation , but that 's about it . If this thoughtful being created a harmonious existence , does n't the extinction of umpteen species screw things up somewhat , or can your inexplicable harmony just carry on regardless . Smiley
So there you have an example of a deterministic system acting to suprise you with unpredictable behavior . Consider it an example of deterministic `` free-will ''
So doing a detailed study of something requires that one takes a class for it in a university and reads books papers written on it by `` real scientists '' ? Wow , I never knew that . Thanx for enlightening me .
Well , it may surprise you that I believe that it is deviant to believe that same-sex marriage is immoral ( in the sense that it is abnormal ) . This is because I believe that it is normal for most people to want to treat others the way they wish to be treated themselves . I believe it is normal for others to work toward the happiness of others , especially when that happiness does not interfere with their own happiness . But it does not follow for me that one can oppose same-sex marriage and follow those rules . It seems to me that people have been told or told themselves that same-sex marriage is bad for so long that they have sort of convinced themselves to deviate from human compassion on this one issue . Well , I suppose what I just said does n't really mean much of anything , just that someone who want to spend his or her life with the one he or she loves does not qualify as `` deviant '' behavior in my book . It is not something that must be `` tolerated '' , it is something that should be enjoyed for the good present in its nature . You wrote that you do not see the benefits of same-sex marriage . I know I went into the benefits of allowing same-sex couples to adopt , but I also spoke on same-sex marriage promoting equality , freedom , and happiness . Let me expand on that . Equality seems very simple to explain . Currently those who love someone of the opposite sex and choose to enter a relationship with that person are granted a set of benefits under the law . This same set of benefits could be extended to those who love someone of the same sex , but it is not , and they are still forced to pay any costs in taxes that salary cuts from businesses that might be accrued through these benefits being bestowed upon someone else . This simple fact violates equality , and I think this is clear and easy to understand . What may not be clear is why equality is so imporant . Granting a set of rights to one group of people that another does not have elevate the first group over the second . The more equality is removed , the more one group is elevated over the other and the more that first group is leeching off of the second group . If the first group could provide those same bonuses to the second group without causing any real harm , the first group is obligated to do so . For the powerful to take things for themselves that they could just as easily share with the weak crosses the line of moral evil . Freedom might be a bit more difficult to understand . Though the government is not granting the same set of benefits that it gives opposite-sex couples to same-sex couples , it is not actually taking any anyone 's freedom to behave in the manner they please . Or is it ? By benefiting one lifestyle over another , the government is directly promoting that specific lifestyle . Taken to the extreme , the government could just as easily imprision those who do n't live the way the government commands and claim that those people have complete freedom , they just do n't have the `` benefit '' of walking around that other people get . The lack of these benefits could be considered a fine for not living the way the government intends , or more accurately , the government is promoting one lifestyle over another . To any extent which the government does this , we all lose a bit of freedom to behave in the manner that we want . Of course there are good reasons to restrict freedom , taking into consideration murder and stealing , however those are actions that cause harm to people ; they are restricted to protect the rights of others , to stop harm . I do not think that any of the reasons you listed are harms that opposite-sex marriage does not also imply , and I think most of the harms you listed are not really harms at all as explained above . In fact , same-sex marriage brings plenty of benefits ( again , as I explained above ) . This in no way warrants the restriction of freedom . Finally I come to happiness : this is the end of all governments . Governments exist to make as many of their citizens as happy as possible , or at least give them all as much an opportunity to persue happiness as they can . The ideas of freedom and equality are really only a means to help people achieve happiness , to help the achieve the best standard of living they can , to help them be able to do the things in life they want to do , to help people in any way they can . With same-sex marriage , we have the opportunity to help a set of people without bringing harm to anyone . We have the power to give the same rights that we hold to a group of people different from ourselves . We have an opportunity to help people , and I am forced to conclude that we can not call ourselves equal , we can not call ourselves the land of the free , and we can not call ourselves a morally good society if we do not take that opportunity .
So it 's not about what 's scientifically correct - or in other words , the real natural history of earth as determined by multiple independent avenues of scientific endeavour . What 's important is that we teach the correct spiritual message , regardless of accuracy - the correct message being ... yours ?
You would have been better served researching the scientific method directly . A branch of science is any field of study to which the scientific method is applied . My OP critique of the work produced by the ID movement was deliberately philosophy-agnostic . After all , so long as the science done is rigorous , it matters not at all what inspires one to pursue a study in the first place . The religious motivation behind the ID movement is only significant in the larger context . What they 've got right is their deduction that they need to find something that ca n't have evolved in order to infer design . What they get wrong almost immediately is their belief that irreducible complexity represents an impossibility for evolutionary processes .
You know that what you call `` immoralism '' is my life . Why do you hate me so much that you would be willing to deny my the happiness that you take forgranted and as your due ? You do n't even know me yet you are willing to defame me just because I am different from you . I do n't understand how I am running over you by living my life openly and wanting the same thing as you the right to consider whom I choose to be my family . If you have an opinion about gay rights thats fine . If you want to deny me the same rights , as you take for granted , because of your opinion and beliefs though laws then that is bigotry .
And SS 's hypothesis is demonstrably false . Humans are one of the least genetically diverse organisms , and yet , there is an average of 14 alleles for every gene in the human population . Any two people can , at most , carry 4 alleles for any given gene . Even if we consider a very simple and famous example , the peppered moth ( Biston betularia ) , we find that the color is determined by a single gene of which there are 5 known alleles . And then there is the great variety in domestic dogs . Although there is little doubt that our dogs are descended from wolves from somewhere in Asia , there are many , many alleles that do not exist in any population of wolves . Some breeds are the result of known mutations .
And as ruled by the Supreme Court , that right includes personal defense and the ownership of modern weaponry . That means you ca n't be against ownership of particular types of weapons , ammo , or magazines .
Quite true . This is pretty funny .
Is that what all of this says to you ? What it says to me is that We the People are the ONLY owners of this country , and are n't about to tolerate European ideals of governing . We will be Free ! Just like a nation builds up armament when it sovereignty is threatened , We the People are doing the same ! We will not become the Chickens you are trying to ascribe to us ! We are the ones who hold the power . We will be the ones who decide ! NOT YOU ! AND DEFINITELY NOT THE U.N . It also says that the Anti 's have completely overstepped their boundaries ! If they thought that this election meant they can continue to run roughshod over the 2nd amendment , they were sadly mistaken ! What do you call an armed citizenry ? Sir or madam !
The above came from the same link . Some still perfer the Mature Creation idea , but I am convinced as time goes on and IF the idea put forward in `` Starlight and Time '' is still a valid concept that they too might come and be a little more explorativein this new Relativistic Cosmology . I for one am all for it . Before I had no answer and was wondering this question myself . Thank goodness no one ever asked me that kind of question before !
Well you better hurry up . Are n't you like 113 years old or something ?
So you 're saying that only Christians can get married ? You 're going to be running into a tempest if you contiune with such ridiculous comments . Let me be the warning : temper your claims and get some history as well as comtemporary knowledge about how religion is used in the world . You 're going to be in for a real hurt here if you do n't .
This is a pretty loose definition . It 's like saying you have faith that Jesus will come again because you personally witnessed his ressurection . But you did n't , you have faith because you believe this with absolutely no material evidence or logic to back it up .
Oh , well , that convinces me .
I did not say that violent crime `` rarely '' occurs , merely that the risk of being a victim of such is lower relative to other risks . I am genuinely curious if you care as much about protecting your heart as you care about protecting yourself from criminals .
My pursuit of happiness is denied by trees existing . Let 's burn them down and destroy the environment . It 's much better than me being unhappy .
The bible is evidence . Its existence is a fact . What that fact represents is subject to interpretation . Ken 's argument is that choosing to believe the bible is infallible is no more or less of a presupposition than choosing to believe that logic is infallible . He 's right in absolute terms , but those axioms are not equally congruent with reality .
Well both could be a good mother because i know a mother who was very certain she did n't want her baby and went for an abortion but was too late on in her pregnancy to have one and then she was going to give himup fpr adoption but as soon as he was born she loved him and could n't bear to give him up and know she 's a great Mum . Being a good mother mainly depends on what you are like with you 're child after birth .
yea ... it 's like ordering a pizza . First the paleontologist digs up a bone or other artifact ... then he calls the lab , tells them what he found and gives them the date they can expect the bone to arrive for `` testing . '' Then the lab asks him from what organism the bone once belonged and also what toppings , I mean dates , he wants for his bone . Then the paleontologist gives him the range of dates that most suit his presuppositions ... ..Then the paleontologists sends in the bone fed-ex , along with a gift-certificate to the finest steakhouse in town and two tickets to the ballgame , and then sits back and waits for the results . Finally , just to be on the safe side , the paleontologist repeats this scenario with at least 2 more labs ... this way just in case one does n't cooperate he has backup and he can pick a date from any number of labs .
Well , all I can say then is that no action is just about as bad as failed action , and IS as bad in terms of anything current . Either way you do n't have gay marriage . You have a majority in Congress right now , and you 're not demanding much change just because of fear of backlash ? Yeah , there would be backlash . Heck , the Civil War was the ultimate backlash , but that did n't stop abolitionists from demanding more than TOKEN change , and it 's a good thing they did . It 's your gig , though , so do what you want . I do n't see much point in laboring this discussion any more ; I 'm just pointing out my observations .
The Bible contradicts `` reality '' . So does heaven and hell . Once you start doubting parts of the Bible , the rest falls apart . Can you PROVE that their is a heaven or a hell ? Can you PROVE that there are miracles ? No ! When you do n't believe in part of the Bible , you might as well not believe in all of it .
What does a mutation have to do with a heart transplant ? What are you smoking ?
Hm ... And I allowed to bring the amendments into this ?
It is clearly not a strawman argument . I think he does n't know what `` straw man '' means and I think he is meaning to say `` red herring . '' It is n't a red herring either ; it 's a perfectly logically related question . I would guess he does n't see that as he neither understands evolution nor bacterial resistance and , thus , the relationship .
Thank God South Africa is taking such a great step forward into the future . Prejudice is terrible and it 's so damn bad when people are blinded by hypocrisy .
and a brain with no body kept on life support is only a brain ... no person . If beg the question here . I deny that a level of intelligence is needed to deserve rights . I disagree that what you can do is a requirement..only what you are ( that being a human ) . Still , I quoted you as saying `` a basic human fundamental right '' ... I am not sure what this right is or where it comes from or why it is fundamental or why it only applies to the humans you think it should apply to . Perhaps we should restrict it to only white folks again ... after all , white folks are the only humans with white skin which makes them different from all other wildlife ... right ?
Yes , socialist . Check the definition . I do n't watch Fox . Is that the best you can do ?
But why do you think that doubt limits people 's ideas ? If anything it helps to expand them .
Actually , no , they do NOT . The first three ALL describe God causing them - are you saying the bible is describing God 's actions negatively ? Or are you saying that killing your precious foetuses is just fine as long as the persons carrying them are `` wicked '' . Sorry , but you need to get an argument , Phyllis . +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Spelling and grammar for this post has been checked and cleared +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
I think we are talking about different things . A belief in adam and eve is not the same as being a good christian . The disbeleif in adam and eve can not DIRECTLY be used as a excuse to murder . Also did hitler talk about anything else other than keeping bloodlines pure ? Because these ideas to rely on the main theme of darwins origin of the species , in your quote you show how darwin states that eugenics is just an obvious consequence of the facts of animal husbandry .
Coelacanth - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia As if this should be any surprise . The theory of evolution mindset once again contradicts observable science .
I think you could teach gun-control at a gun-free school , too . Sex-education is also taught in schools that forbid their pupils to couple on the school yard .
So your answer is to just continue with the way things are now : continue forcing the law-abiding to go unarmed and let only the shooter have exclusive access to guns so they can kill all they want ? How many unarmed people have to be killed in a `` gun free zone '' before you come to realize that mandating unarmed and helplessness will do nothing to save even a single life ?
Well , ya know , if you actually , oh I do n't know , VISITED THE SITE , you 'd see that the `` friendlyatheist.com '' is a blog-like page ( and not the one that is actually giving the info on the evolutionary migration of humanity ) and it gave a link to the actual website that we are talking about ( the second link I gave ) : http : //www.bradshawfoundation.com/journey/ But then , maybe we 're expecting a little too much from a creationist .
Hence why this forum is essentially a joke . Without PRATTs , creationists have nothing . Go to the link in my signature for a place that cracks down on PRATTs .
No but the fact that infants have brain activity makes them a world of difference between a zygote that has no brain activity . They can think and feel and exhibit all the characteristics of other human beings . A zygote exhibits none of those characteristics .
so whats your belief of how life/the universe began lurch ? ( if any )
Well , by the strict defintion of the word `` born '' , an abortion is considered a premature birth .
Really ? ? ? You think most people would incorporate the golden rule ? I do n't think so -- I think most people are willing to make a buck off of others ( business ventures ) , land that job they want before someone else gets it , curse someone for cutting them off in traffic , get that parking spot before the guy coming around the corner gets it , or even get in an intentionally insulting dig to someone in a discussion forum such as this . The examples could go on and on ... I think a lot of people like to THINK they incorporate the golden rule , but at close , honest examination would find that they rarely do .
Where were the French on D-Day and the Normandy Invasion when Hitler was burglering their Nation ? I do n't recall history mentioning a Frenchman around but the Americans were saving their rears once again ...
-Mosheh Thezion
Because the men who wrote it mixed their mythology in with their heros . The first 11 chapters of Genesis are obviously mythology . And if what you say is true , then I guess that means that the Illiad is historical . Why would Homer be right about some lives and events , but wrong about others ? And of course , there are other parts of the Bible that are pure fiction - Jonah and Job for example .
When did this `` ice age '' take place ? Between 4000-4500BC ?
Just a layperson of course . But I 'll give it a stab . ... For besides the point that vitalism is an untestable hypothesis and thus useless in looking at these questions ... How does such reasoning prove anything of the sort . All you have is the fact that humans understand the reasons for some variations and not for others . Besides , a selected variation does not mean that it will bode for the best . That is WW 's interpretation and value judgment ... in hindsight ... a variation of the view .. twas God 's will , He knew what he was doing ... but all you have definitively established is that you yourself looked to the past and infered intent as to the future based on your selective perceptions about what was going on and what feels good . Time and space are muddled . Seems to me that the observer using the more effective scientific method sticks ( well ) religiously to the present moment . Plus , `` acausal '' doesnt really mean `` no cause , '' does it ? Just that we havent determined one . It looks to me like the agnostic view . We do n't know what 's going on . Random also seems to mean that there are unknown variables or conditions present . Reminds me of discussion re abiogenesis and the term `` spontaneous . '' I think us laypeople at least mistakenly look at causation in a very linear fashion . Rather than in terms of a set of conditions giving rise to other phenomenon . An aside . I dont like the mistake view ( DNA replication ) . Back to direction , if there 's a wrong turn . Written before seeing the more recent posts .
And what is this `` standard scientific criteria for life '' that a zygote does not meet ?
Hmmm ... . I think maybe it 's possible to have a brief , fragmentary awareness of a higher order , a glimpse of something that is just too vast for the human brain to rationalise , but definitely not in terms of ( for example ) recieving ten commandments on a mountain , or a woman being impregnated with divine offspring , etc . It 's possible that our brains could work like recievers , picking up fragments of the universal consciousness but if that is the case I think it is more likely to lead to madness than enlightenment ! I said I have had no experience of 'God ' but I have had ( and some will scoff I know ) bizarre , spiritual experiences on LSD and mushrooms , which I have only done a few times ( before I get accused of being a spaced-out hippie ! ) . The only way I can describe the experience is as a realisation that everything , all matter and energy , is connected in a fundamental way , and more than realising it you actually experience it , you experience being part of something all-encompassing , and once you are a part you are also the whole in its entirety . You lose all sense of self , and gain a new sense of something akin to omnipresence . Of course this may just be a hallucination entirely confined to the brain but it feels so real at the time that it 's hard to know .
I see a subtle distinction here . Creationism is concerned with the spiritual origins of people . `` Evolutionism '' is entirely concerned with explaining the nature and history of the physical world . The conflict of opinion arises out of the importance of the detail- can Genesis be accepted as a parable which contains a fundemental truth or must it be taken as a historical account ?
Read the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising .
So if genesis ca n't explain some things then it is false ? Ok , genesis , and all you theologians out there , a quick question off the top of my head . Using only scripture , please explain why dinosaurs are extinct .
Right . We are explaining natural phenomena by natural means . We do so simply because we can test natural explanations while we can not test the supernatural . We use methodological naturalism ( not , by any means , philosophical naturalism ) to observe , test and explain the natural . This is not a denial of god or an assumption about the existance of a god . It is a recognition of the fact that we can not investigate the supernatural by natural means . Even methodological naturalists can be theists - Kenneth R. Miller for example .
No , it is not a bad deal for the child . However , my beliefs do not permit murder , even if it is a better `` deal '' .
Suckers bet ? I think so , you anti 's are so damned ascared of guns you do n't have a clue of how to commit a `` murderous domestic terrorist '' act of that nature . Your nothing but a bunch of pacifist , scared of your own shadows , with Brady leading you .
So in other words , you 're saying that somewhere along the lines , God changed his mind .
90 % of the people in the world are Christians ? XXXXX-
Were this true , adoption would be outlawed . The counter arguments to the Violinist Argument do not apply , and in many cases what they assert is false . Very weak .
Done
I think we should argue that these young individuals need to face the full impact of their crimes and not be treated special or given a plea deal .
Well it could mean simple instinct , and I think you will find it was only applied to animals with brains . EAM attributes `` intelligence '' even to bacteria and to corn plants , trees , jellyfish , single celled eukaryotes etc . If one is to consider intelligence the main driver of adaptation it must be omnipresent in living organisms - there is zero support for this concept .
But what if we limit our expectations to `` gun crime '' control ? Sharp Drop in Gun Crime Follows Tough Australian Firearm Laws
You do n't consider yourself anymore advanced than animals ? Not seperated specially in anyway ? If humans are nothing but animals , than you have to question your own views and morals . For if we are just animals , than we have no cause or goals . You may as well kill yourself right now . Please re-think this idea you have . I understand from your posts that you have a hard emotional problem , and I would urge you to please try and answer yourself those questions . You 're views on this issue are built on hate , and annoyance . What morals do you have to support these views other than - You do n't like it . - ?
1 ) You think that most viewers of the movie will be informed ? You sure as hell were n't until you came back and read a link that you would n't have read on your own . 2 ) Presenting the scenario as if Stein were addressing an actual audience when the `` audience '' is composed of virtually nothing but stand-ins is dishonest no matter which way you slice it . To say that it 's okay to be misleading because it 's a movie just backs up the point that we 've been making all along . These people are n't interested in presenting truth ; it 's all about propagandism .
haha ... I 'll remember this next time I think of accusing you of spitting in one direction
Homo habilis is the first species to use fire as a tool I think .
In other words youre happier because the old man did something criminal and broke the law . Admit it .
This is a very simple , easily answerable question . Most people , especially in America , have problems with people telling them what to do . Teenagers hate being under the authority of adults . Adults hate being under the authority of the government and enforcers of the law . Everyone in the world is under worldly authority , but to actually have a God who created you , which gives him the right to make commandments stating what is good for you and what is not , that makes most people really XXXXXX off .
Repeating superstitious nonsense makes it no less mythological than the first , second and third time you were shown it to be so . Skeletons , even from the BRONZE age , let alone your incorrect reference to the stone age , are not fossils .
Hm , that does not seem to match the reading of Steven 's dissent . He seems pretty set against incorporation . [ T ] he right to possess a firearm of one & # 8217 ; s choosingis different in kind from the liberty interests we have recognized under the Due Process Clause . Despite the plethora of substantive due process cases that have been decided in the post-Lochner century , I have found none that holds , states , or even suggests that the term & # 8220 ; liberty & # 8221 ; encompasses either the common-law right of self-defense or a right to keep and bear arms and In short , while the utility of firearms , and handguns in particular , to the defense of hearth and home is certainly relevant to an assessment of petitioners & # 8217 ; asserted right , there is no freestanding self-defense claim in this case . The question we must decide is whether the interest in keeping in the home a firearm of one & # 8217 ; s choosing & # 8212 ; a handgun , for petitioners & # 8212 ; is one that is & # 8220 ; comprised within theterm liberty & # 8221 ; in the Fourteenth Amendment The practical impact of various gun-control measures may be highly controversial , but this basic insight should not be . The idea that deadly weapons pose a distinctive threat to the social order & # 8212 ; and that reasonable restrictions on their usage therefore impose an acceptable burden on one & # 8217 ; s personal liberty & # 8212 ; is as old as the Republic . As THE CHIEF JUSTICE observed just the other day , it is a foundational premise of modern government that the State holds a monopoly on legitimate violence
Because of course , ... people with genetic malady 's have no right to their lives anyway . Right ?
If they really like women . It 's not totally clear that Bush `` likes '' woman .
I do n't mean to be insulting , but that sounds like a Creationist argument - that some things must be taken on faith .
See simplified version of what I already posted above .
They are constructs of man .
Just about any phrase you want can come up with a bible code , right ? Is there a program out there than looks for specific phrases with gaps ? ? It should be possible to use the bible codes to prove that Intelligent Design is a fake , right '' .. some phrase like . `` Intelligent design is fraud '' and `` William Demski is a con artist '' , or something similar . That would be amusing .
You and Bob just ca n't seem to contain yourself everytime I post , can you ? It 's becoming quite a pattern . You two should get together for tea sometime . I never said Portugal was perfect , now did I ? But I 've been there and it 's certainly a lot less flagrantly sexual in it 's culture than the U.S .
I 've said more truth on this forum alone than you could ever hope to comprehend . Of course , overwhelming your comprehension probably is n't hard at all , so perhaps that 's not saying much . To say that Archie has a better track record with the truth here than do I is pretty much admitting that you have n't been following along , ca n't read , or are delusional as Archie is . I wo n't rule out a combination .
This is a good site to look at for such answers . Tree of Life Web Project By the way , 'and finally to a man ' implies both a direction to evolution and an end point . Both of these are not part of the modern synthesis .
Not really .
Sorry you feel like that . But in a fight to the death there are no rules of decent society . I will cheat and use every advantage I can get to stop a felon trying to take my life . When the police use a stun gun , his partner is standing right next to him as a backup with a 12-guage shotgun . When you sign up for that stun gun , buy then extra optional accessory of a partner with a 12-guage shotgun .
Oh joy another drive by with absolutely no proof or evidence .
Certainly and I 'm all about personal responsibility as well . That 's why I have no problem with time limits and other limitations being placed on abortion ... What 's important though , is that the paramount concern should be that a woman must retain the right to control her own body all semantics of when life begins aside . For there to be true equality between the sexes ( which I feel is one of the most important conditions to having a truly free , just , and legitimate society ) woman must be able to stand on equal footing and they ca n't do that if they do n't have some means of control over their reproductive systems .
Again , `` THE MOST OVERTURNED COURT IN HISTORY ''
Sure you ignore , excuse , justify and interpret any and all info according to your own preconceived notions and comfort zones . Not to mention according to your fleshly understanding which completely ignores the supernatural nature of the great flood . That 's why you come up with foolishness like every one of these stories took place in flood plains , as if you could ever prove that at all based on current topography . And yet you boldly make the claim as if it 's some proven fact . And you guys will say that the story of Gilgamesh precedes the writing of Genesis , therefore Genesis must have stolen the story from the Babylonians rather them being separate records of the same event . What ignorance and rationalization that is in order to justify a fallacious denial of the Genesis account . Here 's an example why that is . There are hundreds of books written about the Moon Landing . So there is obviously a first account written about it . And I 'm sure that years later , other books were also written on that same exact event . Are those later books lies ? Or were their facts stolen from the prior books , or taken from the event itself , just as the first book was ? So you see , your excuses and attempts to dismiss the great flood for such irrational reasons do n't make any sense at all .
This is dangerously like inviting ad hominem ; especially from those such as myself who do n't miss him at all . And he is not here to defend himself .
Actually there is a better solution . Mandatory male and female birth control pills , financial penalties if you stop taking . Anyone who would get off the pill would want a kid , therefore , abortions would cease .
Actually they ca n't . The government does n't have the authority to tell people they ca n't curse in public .
So you are not an American ? You believe that your religion should be forced on everyone by the government ? Is it OK if I am allowed to teach your children my religion ?
You mean `` No ! sex '' , 'til you want *response-ably* to nurture a baby . What novel ideas !
Is that the entire Pro-Choice objection ? Is that the whole Pro-Choice argument ? Does it really boil down to a question of pregnancy versus death , rather than slavery versus death ? If so , I am Pro-Life .
Ah , but then , it might not have been Homer . But then again , whether it was Homer or someone else , is n't earth shattering . Much like whether it was Julius Caesar who crossed the Rubicon , or a decoy of his . Now , if we found an account from Roman times of how Julius Caesar split the waters of the Rubicon by urinating in it so his troops could pass ... Occam 's Razor would not point towards accepting it as true . In reading about John the Baptist ... should one listen to the Bible , or Josephus ?
But only in a good cause - which is defined as putting money into the pockets of friends of the Bush dynasty . Registering gays in DC is not going to do that . Nor will a lot of other worthy programs . On the other hand tearing down a country with one hand while rebuilding it with the other and paying for both ones own armaments and those of the `` enemy '' manages the job nicely . And after all `` the right people '' will come out ahead since they can hire all the cheap servants they want .
So what 's the deal when GWB `` gives '' $ 3,000 but the insurance premiums cost $ 6,000 , the family ca n't make up the difference and the $ 3,000 goes unspent . All we 've accomplished is to transfer $ out of the U.S. Treasury . You think it 's a good idea to just give money away and not get anything for it ? You 're thinking of the Clinton years when there was a surplus .
You lost this debate Skeptic , why drag it back up again ? There are plenty of other subjects that we could debate instead . Pick one of them and let 's debate again . Alternatively , how about a formal debate on ID in which you never once mention Behe ? That 'll be a completely different one and worth considering .
Good shooting ! Got two illegal alien perps that had been deported for previous felonies and just committed another after illegally entering the country again . WE NEED MORE JOE HORNS and a heck of a lot less bradies ! Is this the only case you could find of a CCW exercising his rights ( you know the law applies to any citizen of Texas do n't you and they need not be licensed ? ) completely justified in the Penal Code of Texas . Self-defense and defense of a third person or property is justified and required by law ... IT IS YOUR PUBLIC DUTY . Job well done Mr . Horn ! ! How come you do n't post links ( deleted by poster ) ? This is old news , almost 3 years ago to be exact . Did you think it was sensational ? LOL
Simone is quite right ... women will no longer breed to order according to the dictats of outdated religion . British Muslim women will follow at some point ( many already are ) . There are a few hothead extremists who sit on London street corners with placards stating that `` UK will be Islamic '' , `` Sharia Law for UK '' etc . etc . But those nutters are ignored along with all the other ( non-religious ) nutters currently walking the streets of London . ( For the record , Muslims make up 2.1 per cent of the total United Kingdom population . They are hardly `` taking over '' ) . `` muslims are taking over the world '' is a poor excuse of a reason to be anti-abortion and shows desperation , IMO !
but you too are a figment of my imagination , and you only think you are a giant alien dreaming about this world because i imagined you as such . you can not disprove this either .
oh yeah rubbish rubbish , scientifically speaking , human life ( using a most bsic term ) begins at conception . the twins exist as two seperate entities the moment each contains the individual human dna . seems to me you better be certain when it begins before you go around ending it . if you are driving at night an you `` think '' you might see a person ahead in the middle of the road you are hopefully not gon na drive over that person . Instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop . If you dont like that example , consider a hunter who is unsure what is in the bushes .
My bad , Daewoo . How inconsiderate of me !
That 's still driving , and 15 1/2 is still 15 . My original post is talking about 14 year olds , but I am now talking about 16 and 17 year olds .
It is also a desperate tactic because there are no other intelligent arguments . It is really a `` non-tactic '' , and merely just a re-statement of their position : `` I am opposed to changing the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples in the marriage laws because that would change the definition . '' It is semantically indistinguishable from saying , `` I do n't like the idea of same-sex marriage . '' When objectively assessing the pros and cons , there are no valid arguments against same-sex marriage , except for biblical admonitions ( which are not really objective , anyway . )
You get one post : Homosexual sin - No harm ? A number of reasons . First , `` gay pride '' ( two sins ) . They flaunt it in our faces and try to legitimize it . You do n't hear of `` adultery pride '' parades or `` necrophilia pride '' parades do you ? But even if there were we 'd take an equally stellar stance against those . We do n't want to hear about it . Second , most homosexuals who claim to be Christian try to persuade others it 's not a sin , leading many ( many ) into perdition and hell . We do n't want to see even one soul lost . Third , most homosexuals distort ( or deny ) the scriptures in some fashion or another in order to try to justify their sin . The distort who Jesus is ( saying he 's not God so he never spoke out against gay sex sin ) ; they make lengthly arguments against Leviticus , Romans 1:26-27 , I Corinthians 6:9-10 , etc . Generally , they attack the Word of God and thus attack God himself . We defend the Word and God . Fourth : Sin is a reproach to individuals and nations and brings God 's disfavor on men and nations . Read Deuteronomy chapter 28 to see the curses of disobedience . Fifth , they attack the Sons and Daughters of God when we stand up for the truth of God 's Word . They call us bigots , homophobes , and all manner of names because we disagree with their stance . Sixth , they push their illicit agenda into every corner of America . Suing the Boy Scouts and anyone else who disagrees with them . They try and sometimes succeed in pushing their gay agenda in elementary schools and elsewhere where it does n't belong . Nine year old children should n't have to hear that Billy 's daddy is doing another guy , or that it 's ok to do it . They push their agenda in our faces until we 're quite sick of it . We do n't need to know which way people perform sex acts . Seventh : They ( and heterosexual sinners ) cost taxpayers untold billions in unnecessary health care costs to treat AIDS and other diseases they give to each other . It costs us all money out of our pockets . And eighth : They refuse to repent of it , making their own salvation and those who they lead astray a serious question mark . And there 's more but that 's for starters . Let 's look at the Scriptures and see what you 're trying to sweep under the rug in order to try to justify your illicit gay sex sin : Leviticus 18:22 - `` Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman ; that is detestable . '' Leviticus 20:13 - `` If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman , both of them have done what is detestable . They must be put to death ; their blood will be on their own heads . '' Romans 1:26-27 - `` Because of this , God gave them over to shameful lusts . Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones . In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another . Men committed indecent acts with other men , and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion . '' 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - `` Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God ? Do not be deceived : Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God . '' 1 Timothy 1:8-10 - But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully , knowing this : that the law is not made for a righteous person , but for the lawless and insubordinate , for the ungodly and for sinners , for the unholy and profane , for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , for manslayers , for fornicators , for sodomites , for kidnappers , for liars , for perjurers , and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine  Jude 7  In a similar way , Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion . They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. There 's no gay marriages in the Old Testament ; No gay marriages in the New Testament ; no gay sex approved anywhere in the Bible . Just the opposite - gay sex is condemned in both testaments . God is consistent on that . And to close : Whosoever shall be guilty of Rape , Polygamy , or Sodomy with man or woman shall be punished , if a man , by castration , if a woman , by cutting thro ' the cartilage of her nose a hole of one half inch diameter at the least. - Thomas Jefferson Amendment VIII : Thomas Jefferson , A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments And that 's all I have to say on that .
Because your mommy and daddy told you `` no , no , no '' when you did something wrong . Even my dog does that . When she was a puppy she used to poop in the corner of the dinning room and pee in the guest bedroom . She was always ashamed even before I found the evidence . In fact , because she was ashamed was the reason that I went looking .
It should be noted that other exotic amino acids are also used by a few other codes ( derived form the original ) . E.g . Selenocysteine and pyrrolysine are encoded for in many archaea and vertebrates . Archaea , however seem to be the most primitive organisms , thus these encoded amino acids must have been fixated early on . Thus an interesting question can be applied to an `` evolving '' code as posited in the above quote : Are these `` still evolving '' mRNAs , still evolving ? Or did it hit an inevitable global optimum ? Secondly , from the article :
1 ) Charliegone 's article was a published research article . I would love to know where `` NARTH 's '' editorial was published , if it even was published . 2 ) NARTH 's article DID NOT show any `` higher homosexual activity '' because of legalized gay marriage . It thoroughly failed to show ANY rise in homosexuality in ANY `` gay marriage '' country . It showed some studies which were reportedly done in those countries , but that 's it .

How is mythology relevant ?
Because Matthew , society has to take the time to define its standards . We do n't start with the assumption that anything-goes ; standards are developed over time . Your question is no different than the recent couple in Germany in the news who are brother and sister wondering why they should not be allowed to marry . Marriage laws have to have limits somewhere in terms of what sort of arrangements of people suffice to be considered marriage , and this is all a part of simply determining ( over time ) where those limits fall . Many rights in our society DID have to go through a people-deciding process , so you are wrong that on no other issue do we see that sort of thing happening . In fact , even with civil rights itself , it happened in the form of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . It happened earlier than that with women 's suffrage . Voting on civil rights is a well established precedent . Some things have become rights , some have n't . It 's a process that our society goes through in defining its standards . The problem is that some in your movement seem to want to circumvent that process .
Somehow I do n't think a high percentage of Ham 's `` facts '' are facts .
Ah , no this is n't true at all . Not even close , actually . The Human Genome project has never discovered anything of the sort . The average human has far more than three mutations . Just take a look here : http : //www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mutations.html Where you may find the quote :

I 'm quite sure that the biologist did n't get his degree from an accredited university . Any honest biologist would have realized very quickly that the DNA of a mushroom and the non-existent DNA of an igloo quickly disprove his hypothesis .

When was the last time you tried to gain access to a gun when you were over there ?
An excellent question . I 've always felt I 've led a good life . My philosophy has been that if A ) God wants some specific behavior from us and B ) He ca n't make it clear what it is , then to heck with him . I lead a good life and if that is n't good enough than phooey . That would n't be a God I 'd want to worship anyway . You understand of course that I do n't except the mere existence of a book as God making his desires clear . Now all of a sudden we know that the Bible is in fact God telling us what he wants . The problem then becomes deciphering it . The Bible is not as cut and dried as some would like . God seems to undergo a radical personality shift between the OT and the NT , from a God of smiting to a God of love and tolerance . Which part are we to listen to ? Do Paul 's letters carry the same weight as the Gospel ? I 'd have alot of questions . I guess how much I 'd change my life depends on how forthcoming God is . Is the only thing we 've learned what you 've spelled out ? God exists , Genesis is correct ? If that 's all we 've got , than I 'd still be forced to judge God based on my own ethical standards , same as before . The mere fact that a God exists does not , in my opinion , mean He is worthy of worship or following . God does alot of stuff in the OT that seems unjustifiable to be , and I 'm not willing to let things slide just becuase someone claims ineffability . So I guess I would still lead my life as best as I could , according to the standards I 've developed . At least , that would be my intention . Knowing that God was in fact watching and judging me might , for example , put a damper on my support of gay rights . I 'd feel like a coward , but it could happen . On the other hand , if God was willing to do a Q & amp ; A session and fill me in on a few things , and clarify a few points , then it 's entierly possible that I might change my lifestyle . I really have n't written up my interview with God , so I 'm not sure what I would ask or how the answers might change me , but I 've got to assume that if I could chat with God , something about me would change .
I suggested nothing . You are reading into this some thing that is absent . `` The nurse then informed me , if I had answered yes to any of the questions , I would have lost my concealed carry permit as it would have gone into my medical records and the VA would have reported it to Homeland Security .

But bestiality consists of animal cruelty , so very much hurts another . Just not another human .
That 's the trick , is n't it ? If its a threat . But since when is a fetus a threat ? Sure , when the fetus is endangering the mother 's life , fine . But 97 % of the time , it 's not . Can a woman kill using her own body ? Steal ? Rape ? No , of course not . I ca n't rape anyone and get away with it because I used my own body . Next time you get caught stealing , tell the judge that you were using your own body to do it , and you can do whatever you want with your own body . Enjoy the following laugh . And prove to me that a fetus is not a living human . In fact , find ANYTHING that is made of cells and is or was not living .
This is the situation as it is in Britain .
Yes , everyone is a `` potential '' felon . Fortunately most people never commit a felony . And there are many different types of weapons , all which could be used by previously law abiding citizens to commit an act of violence .
** The word subordinate , it will surprise you to learn , is not limited in its application to human social groups . You should check your semantics before you bleat on about words you only partially comprehend . Of course that 's never slowed you down in any other context , so keep on bleating and braying . Your problem , not mine . But just for FYI -- `` subordinate adjective Below another in standing or importance : inferior , junior , lesser , low , lower2 , minor , minor-league , petty , secondary , small , subaltern , under . Informal smalltime . See over/under . In a position of subordination : collateral , dependent , subject , subservient . See over/under , part/whole . '' The usage as a value judgement applies here because it rflects the darwinist/materialist attitude towards genes and whole organisms , where genes are given primary importance , especially in evolutionary biology . The second sense , that of 'contingent ' and 'dependent ' is strictly a matter of objective classification and is often used in systems studies , and is not confined to human social systems at all . For instance , our moon and sun are subordinate to our sun . See -- `` dependent also dependant adjective Determined or to be determined by someone or something else : conditional , conditioned , contingent , relative , reliant , subject . See start/end . In a position of subordination : collateral , subject , subordinate , subservient . See over/under , part/whole .

Actually , you have n't understood much of what has been discussed here , have you . Scientists are quite sure that evolution is 100 % absolute . It is quite simple . Evolution has been observed . There is no question whatsoever . Changes in populations of organisms that meet the definition of biological evolution have been observed and are observed all the time . Strains of drosophila used for genetic studies have speciated several times so that many of them are no longer able to interbreed . This is in spite of the fact that they are all derived from a single population . The original strain was domesticated in California . Recent experiments have shown that the laboratory strains ca n't interbreed with the original population any more either . That is evolution . There is no doubt . The DNA of Drosophila has been sequenced and studied and differences that prevent interfertility have been identified . That is evolution . That is 100 % sure . What is n't sure is whether the theories that explain these facts are correct . For most of the fundamental theories we are about 99 % sure . Some of the newer work is less secure . New theories on the frontiers of knowledge are still being tested and amended . But of course , it is evolutionists who have closed minds and not religionists .
Walking-fish : And here we get into a conundrum , because , without reproduction and natural selection , an organism would n't be able to adapt well enough anyway to remain immortal . So immortality for the individual must be sacrificed for immortality for the germ line or lineage .

If it turns into a tumor then it was never a true blastocyst . therefore your whole statement and the premise of your claim is fallacious . Prove that a fertilized egg actually EVER mutates into a cancerous tumor because I have never heard of such an occurrence . And how can you state that an unborn child is a parasite when its very existence is as a result of the human species process of procreation ? How are we to continue the species apart from this so called parasitic relationship between Mother and Child ? And contraception vs abortion is n't a separate issue at all . It is the very core of the issue . Are we to allow abortion to be the universal solution for ridding a woman of an unwanted baby when the mother and child are both perfectly healthy ? Why ? Should n't this extreme procedure that leads to the death of an innocent child be reserved for extreme circumstances only , such as preserving the life of the mother , rape or incest ?
Why ? ... ...
But faith is not religion . Religion is the expression of belief in a god or higher being or power of the supernatural . As an agnositc I think that both theists and atheists are wrong since it is impossible to know for sure wheither a god exists or not while one is still alive .
And just how does your description differ from materialism not one bloody jot - unless you intend to admit of supernatural hypotheses which are untestable empirically . Does your version of `` science '' admit of non-physical , non-material expalations . If so tis not science ore even `` science '' its pseudscience or superstition or worse .
And wrong again . Hypotheses become theories once `` enough scientists reproduce the same results repeatedl '' as you crudely phrase it . Laws deal with tiny parts of the theory that can be expressed in simple mathematical terms . Natural selection is in it 's basic form a law . But there is masses more to it than a simple law , so it gets to be a theory . Theories are the pinacle of achievement in science : they are , in simple laymen 's terms , fact .
Good old monkeys ! What ca n't we learn from them Since we are in the Creation vs Evolution section I 'm guessing that your debate here is that monkeys and humans show some similar ways of thinking such as in this experiment . It does seem like further evidence that evolution did take place between our two species although it is n't a case cracker by any means .
Well , the degeneration point is weak , and you should know that the `` origin '' angle is also quite weak .
No one said he invented guns ! A straw man argument is an informal fallacy based on misrepresentation of an opponent 's position .

Certain people include the big bang in the `` general theory of evolution '' . This is the statement I made and it is a fact and not ridiculous . I did not discuss the truth of the statement I made the comment the statement is made .
Some apply logic , some do not . So much for contradictory thinking . What evidence do you have that suggests logic exists outside of the human mind ? Hold the mythology , please . from infidels.org - The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines logic as `` the science of reasoning , proof , thinking , or inference . '' Logic will let you analyze an argument or a piece of reasoning , and work out whether it is likely to be correct or not . It 's worth mentioning a couple of things which logic is not . Firstly , logical reasoning is not an absolute law which governs the universe . Many times in the past , people have concluded that because something is logically impossible ( given the science of the day ) , it must be impossible , period . It was also believed at one time that Euclidean geometry was a universal law ; it is , after all , logically consistent . Again , we now know that the rules of Euclidean geometry are not universal .
I see . So you seem to be having some difficulty in deciding which religion is actually correct . Perhaps none is , since all that you mention are relatively recent inventions of men . Mr. Kent Hovind is scientifically illiterate and just counts on duping the uneducated . With just a little effort it is possible to learn that Mr. Hovind proposes pseudoscience . Even Answers in Genesis has criticized the points that you find so convincing . I suspect that you too , are scientifically illiterate and lack the knowledge to dicern where he is feeding you a line of crud . Really , it 's not hard to figure out if you have the integrity to look for the real facts . If Hovind is correct , then every scientist in the world , even the Christians , are menbers of a vast conspiracy to deceive you . The very idea is simple minded . Hopefully you will grow up some day .

Well , in the case above , it was step-by-step . First , an existing enzyme was modified to a new use , and over time , became refined to work better and better . This is the way evolution works . Nothing is de novo ; it 's always a modfication of something else . Second , a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available . Again , this was refined by natural selection over time . In the end , the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex , because all three parts have to be present for the system to work . And do show us your numbers proving that such processes ca n't produce new information . If you do n't know how , I 'd be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population .

Really ? I was n't aware that the definition had changed . I do know that a definition was formulated as part of the modern synthesis back in the 1930s and 40s . That is the definition I learned some decades ago , it is the one I have always used , and it is the one that I still find in modern biology texts . It is also the one that all biologists that I know use , and of course the meaning definition of what evolutionary biologists mean when they talk about evolution should be determined by evolutionary biologists themselves . It seems kind of an empty exercise to invent a definition that is n't what evolutionary biologists mean and then argue against it in an effort to disprove evolution . Let me put it this way , do you think that it would be acceptable in a discussion of Christianity if I were allowed to invent my own definition of what a Christian means when he talks about salvation ? So please , please tell us about some of these changing defintions . Like I said , I 've been using the same one for over 40 years and was n't aware that it had changed .

Actually you 're wrong . Actually you 're very , very wrong . The 5th Amendment , and all the other amendments in the Bill of Rights , only provide protections against government interference , not interference from your neighbors and people who do n't have governmental jobs . But just for the sake of argument , if you want to argue how the man 's rights were violated , how about we discuss the rights of the woman ? Does n't she have a right to not be raped ? Does n't she have a right to be secure in her own home against forced invasion ?
I have noticed he seems content to drop a Ad Hominem neglecting to actually argue .
Just as you make certain assumptions that never change regarding evo , so does the Creationist hold that certain absolutes exist regarding Creation , such as a personal God created all that is . We understand science ca n't prove God which is a huge stumbling block for the evolutionist , but is n't one at all for us because we can see the spiritual which evades the scientific perspective at all levels of understanding . And ID would insist that it is evolution that 's the atheistically motivated pseudo science , so we will continue to disagree there also .
And to me , although it it one of the hardest decision a woman has to go through , it is n't murder .
Nope . Frame-shifts move the whole code down one step , making entirely new genes . Often , this is disastrous , but sometimes , a useful new enzyme results . Barbarian observes : It 's remarkable then , how much progress we 've made . You may or may not approve of the theory , but it works very well at learning more about biology . And , as you may have noticed , we 've been very successful at interpreting the data . We 've learned to do a lot of things as a result . One of the most important reasons scientists accept the theory is that it works .
So in short the best case scenario is we go from $ 6,000 per capita to ... ... . $ 6,000 per capita . Basically this would mean less care for the already insured and more care fore the under insured..well , some of them . This seems optimistic to me .

I think pro-gun extremists ' stubborn and uncompromising opposition to even small amounts of gun control appears unreasonable to a lot of people and turns people against them . The pro-gun side plays a role in creating their own enemies . One example of this happening is the case of Sarah Brady . In her own words : `` Dorothy and the manager of the company stopped by in their pickup truck with the idea that [ we ] would go swimming . Scott got in first , and I climbed in behind him . He picked up off the seat what looked like a toy gun and started waving it around . I took [ it ] from him , intending to say he must never point even a toy gun at anyone . As soon as I got it into my hand , I realized it was no toy . It was a fully loaded little Saturday night special , very much like the one that had shot Jim . `` I can not even begin to describe the rage that went through me . To think that my precious little boy , 6 years old , had actually held a loaded .22 pushed me right over the edge . I handed the gun to Dorothy . I did n't want to see it again , I saidget rid of it . The manager made some lame excuse about how he had to have it for self-protection against union members . I did n't reply . `` Days later Sarah heard a report that the National Rifle Association was pushing a bill known as McClure-Volkmer , which called for the repeal of a Federal gun-control law passed in 1968 . `` Instantly , all the fury that had hit me in the pickup truck came rushing back . I knew the 1968 law well . It was a sensible measure that essentially set age limits for gun buyers , imposed some I inspection and bookkeeping requirements on gun dealers and banned the import of Saturday night specials . I picked up the phone and called the National Rifle Association 's Washington headquarters . I said , 'My name is Sarah Brady , and you 've never heard of me , but I am going to make it my life 's ambition to try to put you out of business .

So , if the argument is analogous , abortion is justified .
Nice raising the bar . Fallacies are a creationist 's best friend . You claimed : '' have never shown to add any new structure or even a new part to any existing structure . '' Now you are changing your argument away from structure as new proteins and especially enzymes ( which are proteins ) do n't count .
Oh , please show me this . I wait with bated breath for you to provide the quotation in which I `` assumed '' that evolution has been `` disproved '' I 'm really looking forward to your providing of this . Until then , you are n't worth my time , strawman .
True but this progesses nothing twoards a conversation because you have no told me the nature of such an existance . You have said if A is then A=A ... . thats saying a lot without saying anything at all because you have failed to provide what A is .
So , IOW , you are saying that those of us who are intelligent enough to realize that your non existent imaginary god does n't exist have a chemical imbalance ? Wow , that 's quite a stretch even for you Archie baby .
Giving an answer to a conumdum does n't necessarily solve it .
If you bothered to consider all of the unlikely possibilities of things that could be in various places in your house ( or all the possible explanations for the origin of the universe ) rather than just the most likely ones , you would be considering new ones for the rest of your life .
You have hit on something . But Christ said give all your money away and follow him , but not many believers obey this commandment . Most Christians are very interested in making more and more money . Capitalism and christianity are incompatible .
2 ) Even if we accept the statement `` Nearly all animal phyla* made their first appearance [ about 543 - 525 million years ago ] '' ( note the * ... wonder what that material says ) , it still does n't address the appearance of the vast majority of species , or of higher taxa like genera and classes . Why are there no robins , eagles , vultures , chickens , emus , frogs , turtles , lizards , alligators , sharks , carp , perch , dolphins , whales , seals , foxes , rabbits , cats , dogs , deer , antelope , zebra , horses , kangaroos , elephants , bats , monkeys , chimps , humans , and so on in the Burgess Shale or other Cambrian strata ? Evolution has a perfectly reasonable , and supported , explanation . But if God created all animals on `` day x '' , then we should expect to find all types of animals - elephants & amp ; humans & amp ; mice , trilobites , and dinosaurs of all various sizes and mobilities , for example - all mixed in the same strata ... but we do n't . ( PS : And `` flood sorting '' does n't resolve this problem with the religious , Creationist position ) . 3 ) The Cambrian `` explosion '' was not really a sudden explosion , but more of a extended event . A recent article ( The Early Evolution of Animals , David J Bottjer , Scientific American , August 2005 ) describes a bilaterian - a bilaterally symmetrical animal - found in strata that is dated to between 580 million and 600 million years old . That 's roughly 45 to 50 million years prior to the beginning of the Cambrian explosion . And the author adds ...
It has n't happened yet is not absolute proof , just that it makes the probability of it being wrong quite small . By the way , if you are in the least bit intellectually honest , I challenge you to actually act on any of those doubts about the reality of existence and any other reality that we understand from all human experience . Otherwise , if you never act on those doubts , you are simply being hypocritical .
oh please dont give me that XXXX ... its so great that you can try to turn that whole statement and point at me being at fault but that in and of itself shows you are at fault because you think that without your way the world would cease . Honestly , the world has lived without gay marriage its whole existence ... . so why implement it now ? ? SHouldnt that say something about the human race when it steeps so low to want to call homosexuals married couples ?
Yes it is true that homosexuality was controversial , however it was not the controversy that lead to the decision being made to remove it . It was the act of one doctor who was sympathetic to homosexuals . It was the choice of one individual , based on compassion , not factual data . Patently dangerous and wrong in my opinion .
Firstly , we take the actual events of creation and the existence of God by faith - because we were not there to observe the events happening . Similarly , evolutionists must also take the supposed progression of life from simple to complex by faith , as we were not there to observe the events happening and they certainly can not be repeated today . If someone gives you an eye witness account of an event that happened before your time and all the evidence that you have collected does not contradict that account , is it no logical and rational to believe that eye witness ' account ? In a similar way , we have the Word of our Creator who does n't lie and who was there in the beginning . The actual physical evidence fits nicely with what we would expect if the Bible is right , e.g . fossils , mutations , the fact that there are billions of sea things burried in massive `` underwater graves '' all over the Earth - some while still eating or giving birth ( i.e . had to be rapid ) . So if the evidence that we have collected does not contradict what His eye witness account says ( i.e . Genesis ) than , is it not logical and rational to believe it to be true ? In fact , it would be illogical and irrational to not believe it !
So how would you make a study that shows the benefits of gun ownership ? I don´t think there is any way to do this .
Accidents for one . Just last week a man who was drinking and cleaning his firearm accidentally shot and killed his daughter . Run a google search for `` man shoots self '' the amount of accidental shootings is rather disturbing yet funny . Most of these however are due to improper gun safety though .

AH ! the old `` information '' gambit . It only shows that anyone who uses this does n't no what they are talking about . Take a biology/genetics class and you 'd realize how stupid this sounds . Thank you for finding this page ! ! !
God can do whatever He wants . Although one can say `` God does not '' or `` God is not '' , a thiest believeing in and worshipping the God of Abraham and Joachim I do not think should ever say `` God can not '' anything ... . With God , all things and everything is possible . Sentiments such as those expressed above in my view seem to be evident in Western Christianity where it seems believers are too often trying to bring God down to our level , imposing limits etc .
Actually , if you look at the example I 've given , that 's false . The probability of A in one organism may be low , but the probability of A in some organism approaches 100 % as the population and the number of generations gets larger . And if A is useful and comes to dominate the population , then the probability of an AB individual appearing then also tends towards 100 % . In the example above , the chance of an AB mutant occurring , if A and B are substantially useful mutations , is almost a dead certainty . It would be amazing if they did n't stack . So saying that AB occurring is less likely than A is misleading at best , downright wrong at worst . Behe is clearly misapplying probability theory .
I see . So , you know the souls of others ? and how God will judge them ? Interesting . That certainly does settle a few things ... .
Are you sure about that ? Do you know who mai'ana is ?
And he accomplished all this human carnage without a gun . This just proves that if it was possible to eliminate all projectile firing weapons from existing on earth , men would find a way to commit atrocities against his own kind just as he did before such weapons existed if murder was in his heart . Guns are not the issue , the corrupted heart/nature of humanity is .
I know that schmuck , that 's the point . The Egyptians were trying to preserve the bodies and under the best of circumstances look how they deteriorate . Now ask yourself this genius , how long does it take for a bone to fossilize ? And does a fossilized bone become immune to the elements and deterioration over millions of years when even steel corrodes from the alkali in the earth ?
After what the Fins been through , fighting the mother country , the Soviet Union under Lenin and then Russia and Germany and finally Germany , I doubt they are going to let their own government take away their guns ? ? Most folks have learned to leave those Finns alone .

** Utterly untrue . I like it a lot , and for several reasons . I come to such debating rooms as this bb in order to debate . That means , a/finding someone with opinions that conflict with my own , and b/finding an opponent who can debate like a mature adult , relying on facts and logic to present his/her case . Finding opponents , a/ , who will defend darwinism with all the fervor of ideological zealots and fanatics is easy -- they make up 99 % of all darwinists who post to internet debating forums . Engaging darwinists who fulfill the conditions of b/ is next to impossible . Many start out rationally and with their emotions under control , but very rapidly become no different from the common herd after they 've had their assumptions and dogma shot down more than once . They very quickly become 'froth at the mouth ' trolls who think that insult and personal attack constitutes legitimate debate . Such people are nothing more , intellectually speaking , than a pain in the XXX , and need to be ignored as much as is possible . You , almost entirely alone , have , to this point , resisted the temptation to turn into an irrational , splenetic , pin in the XXX , as are the ovwerwhelming majority of this board 's regulars . However , if you are about to 'go over to the dark side ' with the rest of them , that 's up to you . I 'll miss debating you .

Walking-fish : It 's a simple game . Just demand that `` evolutionists '' show them an example of a macroevolutionary event within a microevolutionary time frame . And if such a feat were ever accomplished it would serve as an example of special creation rather than evolution anyway .

It stops us from saying we ara a rational people . I do n't support any laws that would allow a father not to have a say so about his child being aborted . Are there any ? ? If it were a life or death thing for the mother no question . As I stated I do n't like the idea but making it illegal would simply put more unwanted kids in state homes . Lets take care of the living first !
If you are saying that we are soon going to be overpopulated and that governments will can either address the problem now or face horrendous consequences in the near future..then no , I cant

So , why do n't you give it a try ? ? ?
How does it not refute creationism ? Creationism states that the world is 7,000 years old . Carbon dating is only accurate up to a point , and that point is WELL beyond creationism 's statements .
Why should we listen to you when you do n't listen to us ?
Obviously .
So you are saying that people who do n't know anything should be killed ? That b/c it has n't achieved consciousness you should kill it ?
He or she is still subject to attracting a mate more effectively than other monkeys , as a step toward producing offspring more effectively via any number of mechanisms .
`` It is our contention that if 'random ' [ chance ] is given a serious and crucial interpretation from a probabilistic point of view , the randomness postulate is highly implausible and that an adequate scientific theory of evolution must await the discovery and elucidation of new natural laws , physical , chemical and biological . '' quoted from above . It would help if you read the post .
Oh ye of little faith . I 'm sure he 's capable of being much more stupid than that !
And you have been so kind as to prove my point . Obviously you fail to understand . I can recommend some books for you to read to educate yourself a little . Let me know . At any rate , after extensive reading of the opinions of creationists such as Mr. Kent Hovind and Ken Ham , we truthfully characterize the creationist knowledge of science when we say :
No what should 've happened was Mr. Clarke not being arrested at all , over a matter of a technicality . With the UK always offering so many `` gun amnesties '' , always telling criminals that they can turn in their illegally possessed guns and there will be no move to prosecute them , you 'd think the officials would extend the same courtesy to honest citizens , that they do to violent criminals .
More assertions . Look at the `` helpful mutations '' link .
Hardly . Given how you abandon thread after thread after thread , I 'm just using those to mock your level of intelligence and education . There 's really no point in debating your specific threads as you cowardly run away from them on a weekly basis . I just like to remind people that you have no understanding of erosion that are so gulliable you bought hook line and sinker the paintings of villagers who based their art on comic books as proof of creation .
Because you do n't give a damn about the circumstances of the woman . All she is to you is a pregnancy and nothing more .
i like this . lets assume that both are mattes of faith , in that there is the unknown element in both cases ( which there is ) . the only thing left is which fits reality best the evidence that supports creation is a book written by some middle-east religiously biased men about 4000 years ago . nothing in this book can be replicated or observed , and they defy observable reality the evidence that supprts the theory of evolution is the observed reality that dna mutates , species that adapt to their environment survive , fossils exist , several aging mechanisms date the planet in the billions of years , and life forms in the millions , and so on . so , do we believe our own eyes , or what a very very old dtory tells us we should believe . thats what it really comes down to , all other things being equal
More unfounded assertion .
First off , God is asinine enough to kill what your ilk calls `` innocent foetuses '' , etc. , so I would n't put anything past him . Secondly , I see you are falling into the usual O.P . of your ilk : when without an argument , attack the opponent on a simple spelling error ( especially when the one letter is right next to the one intended on the keyboard `` n '' is right next to `` b '' last time I checked ) . Really Phyllis , get an actual argument instead of attacking your opponent on spelling errors .
My thoughts exactly . Know your audience as they say ... ... .. Waxy
Heres the thing this is my thought process and probably the thought process of a lot of other agnostics and atheists . Im not expecting this to change the minds of any religious individuals out there ( not do I even hope ) . This is simply what has caused me to adopt the position I hold today . I accept that possibly my logic is horribly flawed ( but I dont think it is ) but even if it were at the very worst I would just be as religious and dogmatic as religious folks . Its just that in my mind I prefer to have reasoning and logic behind my beliefs . For me its better to have reasons and logic for beliefs . Going through this thought process is better for me because of who I am . Maybe some of my reasoning is flawed but I doubt ALL of it is flawed and as long as its not all flawed then I am just that much farther from totally blind faith ( which is better for me ) .
Well I do agree that some people are going too far in treating sex like a dirty secret , most Catholic schools wo n't mention sex to their students , though they find out much about it elsewhere . Unfortunately this is an unreliable source , as you said about your son could have found out about the condom from an unreliable source . Instead of being ignorant to the fact that they will learn about it , they should step in and at least educate them a bit about it in a proper way . Most ( but not all ) of the teen pregancies that I 've witnessed have occurred amoung girls who attend a catholic school . Though we can not blame this all entirely on lack of education . Since their other sources of sex are not so great , there could be a problem with such a high availability of these sources in our culture . There is a difference in treating sexual behaviour as taboo and letting it srawl out of control , teaching teenagers about it in the wrong way . Maybe the best way to deal with it would be with a happy medium . Since we can not deny its existance , but showing kids porn is n't a way to teach them either .
And a lot of blacks were killed through hangings . Are you against rope vendors ?
You lie . You keep saying the same things over and over again , that does n't make them true . Your addiction to violence is showing . Tony Martin shot an unarmed 16 year old kid in the back as he was running away . That 's not self-defence , that 's cold blooded murder . It is not the role of individuals to exact revenge for crimes committed against them . You do n't get to take the law into your own hands . Munir Hussain ran after the intruders and beat them up with a cricket bat in the street . That 's not self-defence , that 's revenge .
And would you care to tell us just what those `` official ideological goals '' are and where we might find a certifiable copy of them ?
Like talking to Richard ?
And the risk to minority 's civil rights is , of course , the reason for the bill . They are , after all , limiting what can be started via initiative , not eliminating the initiative process altogether . The fraud was merely an example of why the change is needed . As has been argued here before , if civil rights need protecting , it 's from the majority . Allowing civil rights to be modified via the initiative process simply makes it too easy for the majority to impose it 's will on the minority . That 's not what a Democracy is about , at least not our Democracy .
This is where natural selection occurs : people who can better survive diseases survive more ( obviously , I hope ) . Also , until recently , the average life expectancy was getting higher . At the time of the pharoahs , 30-40 years was normal . How is 70 or more less than 40 ?
I guess I 'd have to reluctantly admit that it did n't take long for some ... .but I 'm an eternal optimist and think civility will prevail . Besides , I try not to judge everybody by the acts of a few .
You just ca n't fit all those animals on an ark .

As the great Spock said Logic dictates that logic need not apply in this situation .
The thing I am trying to get at is that there would n't be a `` you '' left to have any concern if all of your mental processes were gone and all that was left was the living body sustained artificially . It comes down to the question of when we as people begin and end our existence . From previous posts , it seemed like you agree that mental existence is crucial , but I was n't sure , given your responses on this thread . So , do you or do n't you agree that mental existence is crucial to our existence as people ?
it can be cared by anyone who wants to care for it . a 1-day-old baby is a natural citizen of the country in which it was born , and therefore is protected by the law of that country . killing the baby would be murder . a person being dependent on someone else does not mean that the host can kill the dependent person at their discretion .
Well , I do n't think that is a good way to look at people .
But apparently they ca n't say no to renting the property for a gay wedding , even if they decide to just say 'no ' to everyone and get out of business . go figure
I have never disagreed that marriage is a special dependent class . My point is that it is a society-sanctioned special class .
And people are punished for that , and their service record is going to make clear they did it . I feel that if someone has a service record that gives no indication he or she would discriminate , there is no reason they should be asked questions about their ideological views .
Yea verily !
No . Anyone who sticks to beliefs that a god created the earth just 6,000 years ago is an XXXXX . People are free to believe that a god created the Earth billions of years ago though without deserving the `` XXXXX '' label . Hope this clarifies things for you .
So we think we have designed GPS systems ?
By spreading lies and misinformation . Tell me , if the cause is so just why do pro-life sites lie so much ?
This is not to say that every current dictionary includes such a definition ... yet ... but a number of major on-line ones demonstrably do , and to my knowledge human civilization has yet to suffer any negative effects . ( By the way , the above entries also include the typical `` husband and wife '' kind of arrangement as well . Funny how words can have more than one meaning , is n't it ? )
How can they ? If they exist in the mind and not on there own , then I can chose not do think about or believe in these laws ( Bivalency , Involution , Idempotency , Identity , ( Non- ) Contradiction , Excluded Middle , Contraction , Commutatively , DeMorgan 's , Associatively , Distributivity ) and they stop existing ? Or I could say , `` hofflenosh '' is a concept I think is stupid and does not exist , come to think of it , the law of excluded middle is a stupid concept so it does not exist either . If is existed only in the mined , it would not be absolute . It would be your opinion of the law of logic existing against someone that says they do not exist .
It means life is holistic , not reductionist . Life , as is the genome , is a system -- an irreducibly complex system -- not an assortment of pieces that just happen to be fitted together over time via random genetic changes culled by nonrandom death .
And if she does n't she could 've just made a terrible mistake . If she takes it and decides to have a family , she can try again . Unfortunately , if the conservatives get their way , this wo n't be an option if you turn it around .
The law that VOR is talking about . He says we should prosecute abortion doctors for performing abortions .
I dont have the time nor the funding to put this in video form like Harris and Dawkins . I do n't think many , if any , Christians really do - satire about atheism is n't a strong Christian practice , not nearly as strong as atheist satire about Christianity , it seems . Maybe that 's what made Poe 's Law so notable in the beginning of this thread .
Oh yes , Mr Behe makes a comfortable living out of selling to the ignorant . His newest book is just a rehash of his old book , and has the very same flaws that have been destroyed over and over again . As for your 'religious authors ' being respected.. they are respected perhaps by the fundamentalists that do not understand what science is about .
And here our Government says : Rights and Responsibilities

Actually , not at all true . The organisms of the Cambrian look little like modern animals . It is only the major phyla that are recognized by the derived characteristics . For example , the cordates first arise in the early Cambrian , along with primitive inverebrates . You can safely say that no animal living today looks much like any living then . For example , there were no amphibians , no reptiles , no insects , no birds , and of course , no mammals . Your shotgun approach is n't actually worth answering in any detail . It is n't even your work .
Yes , we have already established that abortionfacts.com is a pro-life page and as such is far from impartial . You talk about `` increased risk of cancer , increased risk of hemmoraging from botched abortions , depression , suicide , post-abortion trauma syndrome '' but these are measured against women who are not pregnant . While an abortion ( like any medical proceedure ) carries risks , these are far smaller than those posed by a woman who sees a pregnancy to term and gives birth . In case you forgot , here are the figures I quoted you before : http : //www.acog.org/from_home/public ... v103n4p729.pdf Which shows an abortion will cause 0.3 deaths per 100,000 carried out in the USA in 1995. http : //www.childinfo.org/eddb/mat_mortal/ Which shows a term pregnancy poses a 1 in 4085 risk of death over a womans lifetime in industrialised nations in 1995 . You do the math- how many abortions does a woman need to have before she is as at much risk as that posed by taking pregnacies to term over her lifetime ? Something like 80 , which gives a good indication of the relative risk ... ...
No , I think that he 's right on target . The drug dealers that are caught here in Michigan usually get caught with weed AND more hardcore drugs . Theyy 're `` full service '' dealers . Weed is a gateway drug , you know .
Well , it was not conceived through an act of love but by an act of violence . Granted , it is n't the babies fault and that would be a very sad situation . I suppose , even being a pro-lifer , that I could get behind justifying an abortion due to rape in consideration of the unwilling , violent conception and the mental trauma of the mother BUT I think that the rape should be reported within 24 hours for the person to qualify for this `` loophole . '' It should be reported BEFORE the victim is aware of any pregnancy . Coming forth weeks or months after the fact is too suspicious and gives the appearance that they are just crying rape as an excuse for a justified abortion .
When treating a woman , her situation is taken into account instead of a black-and-white `` Its a life must protect '' attitude . It seems more compassionate to consider the situation of the patient , instead of making arbitrary rules .
Very well said . However , we also believe that gun owners should get as much training as possible , necessary , desired etc . It just should not be required to participate in a Right Recognized by your Constitution as Inalienable , and therefore protected . That sets a bad precedence for the rest of our Bill of Rights . However , safe handling of any potentially dangerous tool is just common sense .
But would n't it make it more likely that a gun dealer that was involved in gun trafficking would be audited and caught by the ATF ? If there are less FFLs then the ATF has more time to monitor and inspect each gun dealer .
God is not a testable , valid theory for being and origin . It fails the falisfiablily AND verificationism criteria -- quite badly . It 's also highly subjective . Creationism is n't even a peer reviewed , promulgated theory in any credible community . It would n't , and does n't , last 5 minutes against logic or science . Creationism = continual propagation of the same cut-paste arguments which have been refuted day in and day out , but not heeded . Creationism IS N'T a powerful force -- it 's fraudulant repetition .
You forgot one . For trying to bring eugenics to the US . We would n't want those `` poor negros '' reproducing now would we ?
So you do n't have genes in your body that are n't activated ? Aka my father has blue eyes and my mother brown eyes . I have 1 blue eye gene in my body yet I do n't have 1 blue eye and 1 brown eye . But 2 brown eyes . So it 's obviously not active . ( ok bad example ) Do n't know the exact name for it . But do n't rabbits have a genetic response hard coded . As every animal . That when they are being chased that they make irratic maneuvres . He says that the chickens had genes that had some hardcoded information about how to respond to certain conditions . They got activated in them . And the same information was passed to the children . So they do n't come out all big eyed and is mister big teeth my uncle ?
Just to contribute , I 'm pro-gun , have had training in the proper use and laws in my area , and have owned weapons for more than 30 years .

I believe murder is wrong , and there should n't be any of it in a perfect world , but i 'm not going to force my morality down your throat and force you to abide to MY principals while demanding you abandon your own . But it 's not about me , it 's about the person being killed . Think about it .
Why do 14 bus loads , 500 SCIU members , need 2 Police squad cars from DC to protect them from 1 Home owner ? Fishy ? I do n't think so ! I think the COPS were there to Intimidate the one home owner , just like SEIU was there to do ! Cops ! Of all things , they used Washington DC COPS ! Cops ! No ? What am I missing ? Makes one wonder if things got out of hand and the protesters started throwing rocks through the window , and if the terrified home owner would have stepped out with a fire arm , am I wrong to think that the DC police would have shot the home owner ? Seriously What the heck gives ? Cops ! Part of the angry mob ? If nothing else , 500 people trashed this guys lawn ! That is for sure . Am I missing something here , or am I correct to think that we have totally degenerated into Chicago style intimidation politics ? See the video for reasons why I believe this .
So I can take this as a quote to use for you in the future to show you that ( at one time ) you did n't disagree with that argument ? Good to know ! It 's bookmarked !
Really ! Why not ? I 'm very interested .
that 's where you should have stopped ... .if you do n't know the meaning of those terms then it 's probably safe to say you 're not versed enough to know the specifics of the theory itself . No offense .
Actually , no . A specific fossil can not be , and probably will never be , identified as the ancestor of birds with any certainty . It is doubtful that the fossil record will ever be so complete as to make that possible . Your remark tends to support the confusion of creationists . They tend to represent the idea of a transitional as ancestral . Since the ancestral status of any particular fossil ca n't be acertained for any given fossil , and since any given fossil is usually placed in one of the major taxonomic groups , creationists feel justified in claiming that it is just a bird - thus , no transitionals exist . But if you look at life you will see that it is like a bush with many branches . What is being discovered in China is part of the bush that was the lineage from theropod to avian , as was Archaeopteryx . That bush is what is expected from evolutionary theory . There are several fossils that show a progression from dinosaur to bird . We do n't expect a ladder-like chain of a single lineage that evolved until a point that it branched into the birds . There are many lines along that path that went no where but were similar to the one that became the birds .
Actually looking back I wish I had n't posted a lot of what is on those websites . It is a lot of poor arguments and I 'm glad I was able to realize that over the last 3 months . Had I already decided to believe that all of it was true I would n't be here debating you now . You say I do n't want to know . I wonder if you would want to know if God did n't exist . Is that why at the end of your post you seem so unhappy to debate this further ?
Bingo , Wells . It 's the typical creationist standpoint : start with the answer you want , rationalize ( however poorly ) later .
No , Creationism is the specific idea that the creation story in Genesis is literally true ( creation ex nihilo , direct creation of organisms , global flood , etc ) . It is false .
A slimey claim you can not support as usual . In developed Nations , the U.S. is far down the list as has been posted on this very board at least 5 times . Those 'other ' Nations also have far more crime and violent crime than the U.S .
You asked for an example , I gave you an example ... ... .
Conversely , if the fetus and the mother are equal , the fetus does not have the right to suck nutrients from the mother against her will .
Well , in the case above , it was step-by-step . First , an existing enzyme was modified to a new use , and over time , became refined to work better and better . This is the way evolution works . Nothing is de novo ; it 's always a modfication of something else . Second , a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available . Again , this was refined by natural selection over time . In the end , the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex , because all three parts have to be present for the system to work . And do show us your numbers proving that such processes ca n't produce new information . If you do n't know how , I 'd be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population .
So he failed to follow procedure ? So was one of the procedures to assist the child in holding the gun while the gun was being fired and to not stand at a distance ? If that 's the case then the instructor at the firing range was also partially at fault because it was also his responsibility to supervise the child . And I just found this : `` SPRINGFIELD , Mass . - Authorities in Massachusetts are considering whether criminal charges should be filed in the death of an eight-year-old boy who accidentally shot himself with an Uzi submachine-gun at a gun show . `` Hampden County District Attorney William Bennett says he has n't been able to find any law that would authorize a child to possess or fire a machine-gun . '' Criminal charges possible in boy 's Uzi death , Massachusetts authorities say - Yahoo ! Canada News So not only is allowing children to fire machines guns irresponsible it may also be illegal .
When the criminal has greater civil protections than his victim , and this is viewed as being civilized , a society is doomed .
Well , that was a bait-and-switch but it was n't very masterful . Actually , there are two color morphs in arctic foxes that are determined by a single locus . You are incorrect to claim that the brown morph becomes pure white . That is incorrect . It becomes a very light brown and appears to have a blue sheen . That is why it is known as the `` blue morph '' . The `` white morph '' is a light brownish gray in summer and becomes pure white in winter . However , the fact that arctic foxes do ( not can ) change color seasonally is not evolution . All arctic foxes always do change color with the seasons ( it happens much quicker than the `` matter of months '' that you state ) , and that is n't evolution . It is evolution that the arctic foxes , like many other northern and arctic animals like the Mustelidae , have evolved the ability to change colors with the seasons .
I see . Then what you are claiming is that creationists are the ones who should define the vocabulary to be used by evolutionary biologists . Would it then be ok for atheists to define the vocabulary of Christianity ?

Wow , now THAT 'S spooky . And makes much clearer statements and much clearer parallels than INRI 's post .
Let me interject a little 4th . Amendment primer here . The terms Terry stops and Terry frisks come from the landmark case of Terry v. Ohio , 392 U.S. 1 ( 1968 ) . Cases often hinge on the particular facts involved , and the facts in Terry were : `` A Cleveland detective ( McFadden ) , on a downtown beat which he had been patrolling for many years , observed two strangers ( petitioner and another man , Chilton ) on a street corner . He saw them proceed alternately back and forth along an identical route , pausing to stare in the same store window , which they did for a total of about 24 times . Each completion of the route was followed by a conference between the two on a corner , at one of which they were joined by a third man ( Katz ) who left swiftly . Suspecting the two men of casing a job , a stick-up ,  the officer followed them and saw them rejoin the third man a couple of blocks away in front of a store . The officer approached the three , identified himself as a policeman , and asked their names . The men mumbled something ,  whereupon McFadden spun petitioner around , patted down his outside clothing , and found in his overcoat pocket , but was unable to remove , a pistol . The officer ordered the three into the store . He removed petitioner 's overcoat , took out a revolver , and ordered the three to face the wall with their hands raised . He patted down the outer clothing of Chilton and Katz and seized a revolver from Chilton 's outside overcoat pocket . He did not put his hands under the outer garments of Katz ( since he discovered nothing in his pat-down which might have been a weapon ) , or under petitioner 's or Chilton 's outer garments until he felt the guns . The three were taken to the police station . Petitioner and Chilton were charged with carrying concealed weapons . The defense moved to suppress the weapons . '' From these facts we developed the law involving temporary stops and pat downs of citizens . The law regarding Terry stops can be best summarized as follows : `` [ A ] n officer who has a reasonable , articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot may conduct a brief , investigatory stop . While reasonable suspicion is a less demanding standard than probable cause , there must be at least a minimal level of objective justification for the stop . The officer must be able to articulate more than an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch of criminal activity '' . Illinois v. Wardlow , 528 U.S. 119 , 119 and 123-124 ( 2000 ) Therefore , a Terry stop is a seizure under the 4th . Amendment , but it is not a full arrest . The detention and questioning must be brief . Taking a man out of a theater and questioning him would be a Terry stop which would require reasonable , articulable suspicion of criminal activity . From the article it appears the judge has ruled at a preliminary motions hearing that the officers did not have the required level of suspicion to detain the man . A Terry frisk is a weapons frisk or pat down. It requires an additional reasonable and articulable suspicion of danger to justify this frisk or pat down search . In Terry the suspicion of armed danger arose from the type of suspected criminal activity ( planning a robbery ) in which it is reasonable expect that one or more of the three men involved would be armed with a weapon . Note , however , that a Terry frisk is limited to the outer layers of clothing . The hands can not penetrate pockets , for example . The frisk is a search for weapons only . If the officer feels what he reasonably believes is or could be a weapon then he is allowed to penetrate the pocket , for example , to get the object out . But this is allowed only where it is immediately apparent from the frisk that the object is or could be a weapon . If the article is correct , then the search involved in the theater case went far beyond a weapons pat down. Absent some exigent circumstance ( and the article does not mention that any existed ) the level of search done in this case required probable causewhich is the standard of proof needed to justify a full arrest for a crime . It is possible that both the detention and the search will be held unconstitutionalbut the violation is of the 4th and not necessarily the 2nd . Amendment . ( Both of which read the right of the people , in case anyone has forgotten . Will anyone here suggest the armed man can not sue because the phrase The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures guarantees only a collective and not an individual right ? ) I also want to address the articles brief mention of Florida v. J.L . because it is misleading : `` United States Supreme Court in Florida v. J.L . ( 2000 ) ( detaining man on mere report that he has a gun violates the Fourth Amendment ) . '' This gives the impression that SCOTUS has ruled the police can not detain someone who is reported as having a gunwhich is not the case . J.L. was a 16 year old juvenile and it was illegal for him to have a handgun . That Florida law was not in dispute , nor was the ability of the officer to make a Terry stop and conduct a pat down for a weapon if he had the required level of reasonable , articulable suspicion that J.L . had a gun . The issue was not whether the police could detain and frisk a man on a report of having a gun , but on whether the anonymous report in that case claiming he had a gun was credible enough to be relied upon to provide reasonable , articulable suspicion : `` An anonymous tip that a person is carrying a gun is not , without more , sufficient to justify a police officer 's stop and frisk of that person . An officer , for the protection of himself and others , may conduct a carefully limited search for weapons in the outer clothing of persons engaged in unusual conduct where , inter alia , the officer reasonably concludes in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot and that the persons in question may be armed and presently dangerous . Terry v. Ohio , 392 U.S. 1 , 30 . Here , the officers ' suspicion that J. L. was carrying a weapon arose not from their own observations but solely from a call made from an unknown location by an unknown caller . The tip lacked sufficient indicia of reliability to provide reasonable suspicion to make a Terry stop : It provided no predictive information and therefore left the police without means to test the informant 's knowledge or credibility . '' Florida v. J. L. , 529 U.S. 266 ( 2000 ) As I said , cases hinge on the particular facts involved . In my experience news reporters often make broad assumptions without understanding how each individual fact fits into the legal puzzle .
I hardly see why you feel called upon to explain how a hypthetical entity that does not in fact exist requires an explanation at all ! There is no evidence of any sprititual entity or spiritual component to any physical entity .
( Note the key word `` also , '' which admits that it 's human ) . As for the rest , This is more of the sort of `` defensive rationalization '' I talked about earlier , i.e . when people find it more rewarding to self-righteously defend their wrongdoings and thus shirk their responsibility to others , than to shoulder the burdens to those they have harmed , and thus they act in self-absorbed narcissism and sociopathic dissociation , while likewise waxing arrogant in self-deceiving affirmation of their own `` brilliance '' and other superiority to do as they please , by simply denying said consequences however obvious -- illustrated here , by simply calling a fetus a `` parasite '' and thus daintily strutting off away from one 's obvious duties to it , despite admitting it 's also human . However , a human being forced into dependency on another for its life , is not a `` parasite , '' but a VICTIM , and thus has the right to aid from the ones responsible for that dependency . Since you 've admitted that it 's human , then the remainder is plain ; it also has the right to aid from the one responsible for its dependency , i.e . the man and woman in question who proximately caused it to be in its dependent situation through their willful actions in full knowledge of that risk . Here , the doctrine of Strict Liability would apply , in that normal sexual contact carries the inherent risk of pregnancy . This doctrine already applies to men , and should likewise apply to women who choose to abort in spite of their responsibility to the prenatal human in question , created and made dependent on her for its life through her intentional actions .
You need to do a little reading . What you are describing is not what is generally referred to as `` partial birth abortion '' ( which is a misnomer itself . ) If you are going to oppose something , at least learn what it is you are upset about . Who calls themselves `` iron courage '' without any irony ?
I think if Islamic fundamentalism shows us nothing else it 's that ...
That 's not something you can really blame on the pro-life movement . In fact , a lot of effort in the pro-life movement does go into helping single mothers . Many pro-life counseling services help single mothers offering support in a variety of ways , including financially .
Not all who are `` left '' hate God .
And more people have died from anti-gun Senator Ted Kennedy 's driving than will ever die from my AR-15 .
She had plenty of choice in the matter . She should have chosen to keep the kid . Even if she lost all her money because of this it would have been the right thing to do .
Well said . With this religion , the gap is very wide between the `` average guy '' and `` authority '' , because their clergy is more involved in politics than the clergy of Christianity , or the Creator himself . It fits with more Democrats being evolutionists , and more Democrats favoring bigger domestic government .
Well , `` evidence '' for an extraterrestrial creation is n't just through visions and people who have `` seen '' UFO 's . You forget `` evidence '' given by astronomes such as the people from SETI . ( SETI is an organization founded after scientists have discovered a strange signal from outer-space . From there on the organization has developed very much ) The signal , the SETI people got showed the first three prime numbers . This is very strange because it has never happened before ( the scientist who detected the signal , called it WOW-signal , because it was so strange ) This signal shows a major part of Design : Specification But unfortunately , to show that it is really true , it is missing another part : Complexity The signal is evidence , but unfortunately it is too short . If those scientists would detect a signal that shows the prime numbers from 2 to 101 it would meet both parts : it has specification and complexity ... The SETI people would party all night ... So these `` theories '' are n't as unproven as you think they are ... ( I still do n't believe it happened like that )
So what we have here is a lie , based on a distortion , which is itself a fallback position from a fallback position from a fallback position from an evidence-free made-up graph about the magnetic age of the earth . And creationists say the truth is constant ...
But I 'm not debating philosophy , WW ; I 'm debating evolutionary theories .
so what if flagella parts are effected by a change of genes ? ... .so are fly wings . The challenge was to present me any evidence that mutations can actually create new raw material for selection . You have to get out of the swamp somehow . I think this concept of mutations as being creators has gotten a pass for too long now .
Actually , ethics and philosophy are irrelevant . If they are based on Darwin , then they are wrong . Possibly are you referring to the eugenics policies and genocide policies of christian Nazis ?
Again , you 're going to have to explain what relevance the difficulties we have forecasting the behaviour of a complex , chaotic system has to the straightforward observation of galaxies . I mean , they 're galaxies . Right there , in a picture in front of you . I 'm struggling to understand what you think can have gone wrong Let 's use the same kind of analogy you 've employed . If I want to take a picture of a basketball , I can do that close up , right ? But if I want to take a picture of 1500 basketballs , all spaced out , I have no option but to do so from further away . With a standard 28mm lens on a 35mm camera , and allowing 4 square feet of floor per basketball , I would need to be roughly 90 feet up in the air to fit them all in the frame . Now imagine I want to take that same picture with an extreme telephoto lens , equivalent to peeking through a dime-sized hole seventy-five feet away . In order to see all those basketballs through that hole , they 're going to have to be a bit further away . Almost nineteen miles in fact . Now make them 1500 earth-sized planets . It 's a straightforward scaling up of similar triangles : now I 'd have to be almost 2,000,000,000 miles away . 1500 suns ? 217,011,334,736 miles away . 1500 solar systems ( just out to pluto , not including the comets ) ? 919,679,070,315,789 miles away , or 156LY . If we include the comets , that becomes 2,299,197,675,789,472,500 miles . But we are n't looking at basketballs , planets , or solar systems . We 're looking at galaxies , giving us a whopping 145,473,622,268,931,148,838,190 miles or 24,746,725,672 LY . Now , that 's actually rather more than the measured distance to those galaxies , mainly because I 'm assuming they 're all laid out flat . To get a more accurate estimate we need to think about looking through a 'cone ' of space , with galaxies at different distances . But I dunno - maybe I 'm just swallowing all this without really thinking about it
Most doctors wont perform abortions .
Except in New York it 's just short of outright impossible to get a concealed carry license . Also note that he was being charged with a misdemeanor , not a felony . That means that he wo n't lose any of his rights even if he 's given a jail sentence .
Any surgery that is needed for life threatening illness are taken care of ASAP . None life threatening , but life quality illnesses are the one that take time . Hip and knee replacements Life quality . Cancer life threatening . Now , if I am not mistaken , a poorer person without health care coverage in the US would never recieve a hip replacement operation ? Or am I wrong ?
Iangb , I would have thought that you would be intellectually honest enough to have ( at least ) accepted the fact that I have supported my claims . I also thought that ( by now ) someone from your side of the abortion issue would step in ( in this thread or by private message ) and hold you to your claims of being 'intellectually honest . ' At this point , I actually have you questioning Planned Parenthood 's definitions ? QUOTE ;
Yes , but we do not know that homosexuality is not inherited , and it is the arguments like this that make people want to prove that homosexuality is genetic . Also , people born infertile can not reproduce , so are those people inferior in a relationship because of what they can not do ?
Then should not your challenge be re-worded to say `` What might be the best ... '' Because at present we are not at a stage where by we know everything about 'pain ' therefore in the current climate , rather than what might be known down the track , I think I have met the majority of your challenge . After-all , you are insisting now on what 'you can measure ' , and we ca n't measure all that there is about pain , at present .
Actually it was a watch on the heath . Yes , you can see the difference , but what is that difference ? If you have n't identified it then you are as clueless as IDers are in how we detect manufactured artifacts . However , IDers have given you a clue . They just ignore it themselves . This is from Behe 's Darwin 's Black Box : `` For a simple artificial object such as a steel rod , the context is often important in concluding design . If you saw the rod outside a steel plant , you would infer design . Suppose however , that you traveled in a rocket ship to a barren alien planet that had never been explored . If you saw dozens of cylindrical steel rods lying on the side of a volcano , you would need more information before you could be sure that alien geological processes -- natural for the planet -- had not produced the rods . '' Michael Behe , Darwin 's Black Box , pp 195-196
Not if they give him the death penalty , then it 's apeals till your ears bleed .
The thing is , Bush did n't live in Canada .
So you ARE a strict constructionist .
And oddly enough you have been given several on silver platters . Perhaps you need to visit a neurologist and get checked for memory problems ? Just to remind you once more - SICKLE CELL TRAIT is a mutation AND it benefits the phenotype under specific definable conditions . Do you really want to get hit about the head with that bat yet again ?
That 's why I voted as I did as well . Ideally I 'd prefer the `` none required '' policy .
But `` laws '' are just observations that may be part of theories . Perhaps if you made an effort to learn what science is and how it works .
And what do you conclude from this comparison ? That the car hypothesis is correct and any other hypothesis is wrong , right ? So you stop investigating . But is that how we should do science ? NO . It 's laziness and an intellectual copout . What we have is a misuse of the Razor . The Razor is not supposed to be used for comparing hypotheses . Instead , it 's supposed to keep hypotheses out of descriptions of phenomenon .
Yes , exactly , lions/sea otters/seals/manatees/whales . Note that these creatures do not fit in a continuum of animals . The rest of the post seems irrelevant to the question of this `` continuum '' prediction . If I am wrong , then you may clarify this . Otherwise , I see no reason to complicate this line of argument with side issues .
Actually , at the moment I was conceived , someone else became aware of me becoming a human . Brain development does not define a human , it is our potential that helps define us .
Oh No , everyone ! Our Mollusca has been undercut ! Whatever shall we do ?
Indeed - funny how religion - especially the religion in question - has set these impenetrable shields and escape clauses ... . Reminds me of the prayer groups that sought first to prevetn the U.S. from entering WWI . After we entered , they prayed for the war to end . A year and a few tens of thousands of bodies later , the war ends , and the prayer groups thank God for hearing them ... .
It 's possible that Archaeopteryx is not a direct descendant of modern birds but it 's certainly not far from the line and it shares both avian and therepodian characteristics .
saiah 55:8-9 ( New International Version ) 8 `` For my thoughts are not your thoughts , neither are your ways my ways , '' declares the LORD . 9 `` As the heavens are higher than the earth , so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts .
And my interpretation of my writing is that I did n't mean that . Who has more authority ?
Exactly so .
We do n't have to change the sweetner composition . But one person should not get to choose between sugar and artificial sweetener when I am allowed only sweetner . If marriage is a legal right , it must be allowed to all couples . If you do not agree with this , then it must be removed as a legal right and replaced entirely with civil unions . Sugar and sweetner will never be the same thing , and it is an evil action to take all the sugar for oneself then to refuse it to others , telling them that they can make due with the artificial stuff . It 's not the composition of the sugar I want redefined ; it is who is allowed to use it . Changing the composition of sugar would affect other people who want to use it , and it would require people to put forth additional effort for my sake alone . Allowing a same-sex couple to get married does nothing but allow everyone access to that which already exists . I do not want to make special laws just for myself ; I believe that the opponents of same-sex marriage are the ones who seek to do that . I want to give everyone equal access to the existing rights today , equal access to the sugar . There is enough to go around .
No it does n't . First , the changes may not be neutral . I will presume that you are intelligent enough to grasp that idea the mutations in and of themselves are neither advantagous nor disadvantageous , and the they have no purpose . Evolution happens when the mutations ( and other mechanisms that increase genetic diversity ) are acted upon by other mechanisms of evolution . Even in natural selection there is no purpose . Natural selection is differential reproductive success . Some organisms tend to produce more offspring because they have characteristics that give them an advantage in a particular environment .
There 's nothing to help , because what you said has no resemblance to reality . If someone is a junkie , they might also smoke pot , or if someone is a crackhead , they might also smoke pot , but the large majority of pot smokers DO NOT do heroin or smoke crack .
Another personal favorite of mine ... When I showed up to a seminar hosted by a local creationist , I challenged him to produce a textbook with false evidence . He could n't . When I brought every last biology and biochemistry textbook from my college career to him for him to scour , he did n't even bother to look . Translation : this claim is XXXX , and Wells knows it .
The Sun was crucial in the evolution of most life on the planet , but it may not have been the main cause of the very beginning of life . There are hypotheses that energy necessary , chemical catalysts available , Carbon , Nitrogen , Hydrogen , but not Oxygen apart from being part of the Water molecule . There are tectonic activated hot springs and chimneys in the deep sea . There is an availability of Sulfur , heat energy , and the triggering of a Sulphur based metabolism . It was internal energy from up welling and down welling of hot magma which in turn was fuelled by core radioactivity . Some even speculate that the very centre of the core may be pure Uranium . However , there is no need to debate the Second Law of Thermodynamics . It is a ruse by Magical Creationists who deliberately and in my opinion deceptively make Earth a closed entropy system . Cuchulainn PS : Fundies have an obligation to show why the fires of Hell are exempt from the 2nd Law . I already know the answer . Hell is imaginary and imaginary things do not gain entropy .
If I ever see Arch defend a position at EvC I will eat my hat and the hat of my fiance , too .
Yes come over here and live in gun hating australia could you . THen when you call the cops after your father has been murdered and you kidnapped and torchered because you can not have a gun for self defence you can wait 9 HOURS for the police to come and find your bloodied body lying on the ground . When you think of it 9 hours is not that long , I can fly from QLD to Japan in that , or play 3 baseball games back to back or run 3 marathons back to back . I am sure that somebody of your `` intelligence '' will have no problems with distracing some murders for 9 hours . Why carnt US soldiers carry guns on base for self defense ? Please winston i cnallenge you to show us some cold hard facts that taking guns away from the law abiding drives crime down . Perhaps that family could have done it in the 9 hours it took for the police to come .
Ahh ... There you have it . Restrict ammo , not guns . Would be a far more succesful way of enforcing gun-control .
And could you be anymore of a drama queen about it , using the raw sweage thing . That is such a stretch of the truth . People straight and gay have been sodomizing for years and their are very few cases of any of e coli every year . Stop drama queening out !
Oh , I hear you . I am covered by my partner 's insurance here as well . I would not have been able to get the insurance if we were not legally a union . It 's amazing . And I am REALLY greatful for that !
You know America has fallen to a disgusting low when the parasites are furious that someone 's rights are not being trampled on to an equal extent to everybody elses . It would be as though during the bombing campaign on Iraq , the left were out protesting that the US had n't killed an equal number of Israelis , to be equitable . Why even bother getting into the idiocy of someone who thinks the constitution means `` You can restrict free speech , as long as you restrict it to everybody equally , and do n't do the 2nd amendment lobby any favours '' , maybe they 've mistaken the constitution for the communist manifesto .
Those who set the rules can do with them as they please . It is n't illogical nor hypocritical . It IS illogical to assume you can chew gum if the rule is `` you cant chew gum '' and the teacher allows one student to chew gum .
This is not a part of the argument , though . Whether or not the woman can or can not perform activities she wishes to do ( which is not the case in pregnancy , btw , or at least varies greatly according to the individual ) is irrelevant ; it deals with the moral question of disconnecting someone who will die if they are not connected with you . The argument is equally applicable no matter the womans mobility .
In the Soviet Union , the war against Hitler 's Germany was called 'The Great Patriotic War ' . I believe it still is .
It is abrasive to think that republican 's are republican 's souly for the fact of abortion rights or non right 's however you want to put it . My father is a republican , i am a democrat and always will be . My father believes in abortion and he is a republican so your theory is so far wrong from beginning to end . Either way you look at it , Republican 's have unsuccesfully pulled the abortion rights from american women so it really does n't matter .
Well , at least we agree that someone is obfuscating and denying .
Just because something is genetically predisposed does not mean it has a positive benefit , but I never said that it did . Homosexuality is different , because it has no negative reprocussions that are not caused by something social or religious .
And that did n't have a thing to do with my point .
You are like , so totally noble and sensitive ! I really admire your pro-humanity stance . That is going out on limb .
So do you want to argue my points or do you want to argue me ? Which of my bullits are wrong ? Which of them are right ?
perhaps we should read the first amendment again . Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion ( and other stuff , but that 's all that pertains to religion ) . It means it should n't single out a religion . It should n't teach something just because it 's religious , but it also should n't not teach something just because it 's religious . Making a law banning the teaching of abiogenesis and ID as hypothesies would violate the first amendment because the only reason we would be banning it would be because of the establishment of religion . And even if the first amendment does say what you seem to think it does , you think the solution is to violate the first amendment more to balance it ?
Less than a playstation , of course !
Is the little baby upset ? Too bad .
Yes . Were I a logical gay man , I would accept the fact that I can not marry a man due to the definition of marriage . I would accept that fact and continue to demand that all legally joined couples share the same benefits now given to married couples .
What evidence do you have of that ? Tiger Woods is black and he said he felt entitled . Personally , I think some of the worst racists are the flaming liberals who want to keep blacks content on their government-paid plantation .
I think its pretty obvious ... ... ... ... I would say judging by his statement he is against the death penalty ... ... ... ... .
It has ? Silly me . I thought that it was the conclusion made from an analysis of lots of data and measurements . You have a faulty understanding of science .
Certainly interesting . I wonder two things . I would want to look closer at the study design and two , I would like to hear a beaviorist point of view on it . What would skinner have said ? I doubt that he would have attributed the results to a `` sense of fairness '' since that is not an observable item . He likely would have stated that any two animals receiving differential rewards would have likely learned that if they wait then they also will receive a more liked item . Not a sense of justice but learning by observation . Tolman further would argue that conditioned taste responses for the monkey receiving the preferred reward would be of greater value . In other words , if they were rewarded sometime when they did n't do anything would their work rate go down compared to the other monkey ? Would the other monkey continue at the same rate although it may not accept the less preferred food ? These are important pieces I feel are missing from the information .
But , as far as I can tell , the pro-choice side of things is n't just about the woman 's choice , it is about whether or not the fetus is a person . The fetus is a person or it is not . It has legal status or it does not . It can be murdered or it can not .
Well , there is now string theory , which has grown into M-theory , which may have a rational answer ( at least a mathematical one ) . But calling it a theory is really a misnomer . It 's more like a hypothetical model . But , do you have a rational explanation for the Big Bang ? Or do you think that the Big Bang did n't happen ?
Did I ever say I had proof of no god ? I just said I have no proof of god . And I never even claimed anything close to the fact that there is no god . I said that there is no proof of a god and no proof of no god . The thing I pointed out was your double-standard . You do n't believe in parallel universes because there is no proof , yet you believe in God . Where is your proof there and there not proof for parallel universes . If you want to know what I believe , I really believe that what happens after death is irrelevant . I 'm going to live based on what I know . I know that I am alive ( or think I am ) . I know how to live it to the fullest ( and it does n't involve church or praying ) . I will live the way I want to which is probably very similar to the way you live yours . I have n't killed anyone , I try not to lie , I do n't steal . I have probably about the same morals you do , except for one thing . I do n't derive these morals from the fact that if I do n't live by them I will burn in hell . I live by them because I know they are the right thing to do . I will not live my life out of fear , I will live my life the best way I know how based on what I know . If there 's a god , he should n't have a problem with how I 'm living my life and if he does have a problem , I do n't want to listen to him anyway .
Indeed it does .
so how still thinks it would work better in the US ? full story http : //www.smh.com.au/news/national/ ... 455665717.html
`` The right was in the context of the citizen soldier of the conscript militia . In the eighteenth century private arms were never strictly private . The public had a claim for public purposes . Coxe was a strong Federalist . He was employed in Hamilton 's Treasury Department during the Whiskey Rebellion . He expressed no concerns that the enrollment and inventory requirements of the Militia Act would infringe on right of the people to keep and bear their private arms . '' http : //www.potowmack.org/thequotes.html # coxe So Tench Coxe put quite a bit a faith in the power of the militia ? George Washington and Alexander Hamilton did n't agree . They thought that the militia was no match for a regular army . `` Regular troops alone are equal to the exignencies of modern war , as well for defense as for offense ... . No militia will ever acquire the habits necessary to resist regular force ... . The Firmness requisite for the real business of fighting is only to be attained by a constant course of discipline and service . I have never been yet been witness to a single instance that would justify a different opinion . '' ( Letter from George Washington to the President of Congress- September 15,1780 ) `` Here I expect we shall be told that the militia of the country is its natural bulwark , and would be at all times equal to the national defense . This doctrine , in substance , had like to have lost us our independence . It cost millions to the United States that might have been saved . The facts which , from our own experience , forbid a reliance of this kind , are too recent to permit us to be the dupes of such a suggestion . The steady operations of war against a regular and disciplined army can only be successfully conducted by a force of the same kind . '' -Alexander Hamilton http : //federalistpapers.com/federalist25.html
I see your point , Iangb but I 'm not about to be leaving before you 've had a chance to respond . I wo n't be `` leaving '' at all . You challenged me to produce an argument , so I 'm going to produce my argument . I will then summarize the argument , and you can respond to it and we can then discuss / debate those specifics that you have a problem with . Truthfully , this is how I should have first responded to your challenge . Doing it piece meal has only resulted in a less focused debate . -- Chuz
And isnt that called pre-meditated murder if the baby ended up being killed ? ? hmmm
Based on what evidence can you make this conclusion ?
So you knew that in the first place and yet you said that Demon38 was wrong . Perhaps you should pay closer attention to Demon38 and others so that you might learn something . The first day of evolutionary biology class I learned the definition of evolution . Evolution is a change in the frequency of alleles in a population over time . I know that you wo n't understand what that means , so I 'll make it simpler for you . My Dictionary of Modern Biology defines evolution as the gradual process of genetic change that occurs in populations of organisms . I suspect that you are unable to recognize the difference between a definition of the minimum requirements of an evolutionary event , the event itself , and the theories that explain the mechanisms . All three are referred to as evolution . But in this case what was asked for was a definition of evolution . From the definitions given ( by Demon38 and myself ) it is clear that evolution is not only change , but a particular kind of change . It is a change in the heritable makeup of a population . In other words , individual organisms do not evolve . Further , evolution takes place from generation to generation . A single birth or death is not evolution . By the way , when I say `` frequency of alleles '' I mean the relative ratios of alternate forms of the same gene .
And like the police , the Navy could plan and execute raids .
There is some truth here . Did you ever see `` Independence Day '' ? They were taking pot-shots at the alien ships when they first arrived . It did n't stop the aliens ... sure only a film ... let 's look at real life ... modern - Iraq - Sadaam gave guns out to the people just before Gulf War II not so modern - Boer War - Dutch farmers in South Africa were all excellent marksmen - Britain still invaded . US Civil War - I believe that the Confederate States were pretty well armed as far as the white citizens were concerned . US still invaded .
They were both created on the sixth day according to Genesis 1 .
http : //www.dcagenda.com/2010/02/08/m ... asure-in-poll/ Keep in mind that this is an opinion poll , so take it for what its worth , but it seems to indicate that the people of DC wanted to vote on this issue .
How big is the universe ? Are there two divisions - the observable , and the unobservable ? Is the unobservable predictable , just more galaxies and groups of galaxies , going on forever and forever and forever ? If its all that endless and limitless , there would have to be an endless , limitless number of planets exactly like this one . Same number of grains of sand , same number of blades of grass , same number of humans who look exactly like each one of us , doing exactly the same things at exactly the same times . Anything anyone could imagine would HAVE to be out there somewhere . There would be planets exactly like this only dogs rule , or others exactly like this where cats rule . The God I believe in would have no problem creating it and ruling over it all , but it would get a little more complex if the identical humans on the other planets were sinners , needed salvation , etc . to differing degrees . I dont believe there are any more earths like this one . I dont believe there are any planets where dogs rule . I believe there is some kind of limit to the universe somewhere . I 'm not afraid of being mocked because of it .
And i dont really believe in god because he has shown us NO compelling evidence of his existance .
Yes , I 've met enough `` British '' creationists to know . The difference is one of exposure ( they do n't have anything like the public profile of the US movements ) and the pervasive attitude to religion in the UK- people are generally much less up front about their religious beliefs over here . On the poll results , there is some ambiguity IMO . When it states 22 % of people believed in creationism what exactly was the question posed ? does that mean young earth creationism or old earth creationism or both ? Also interesting is the apparent indication of how intelligent design has been rapidly adopted as a method of explaining ones position . The program , Horizon : A War on Science is on tonight at 9:00pm on BBC2 , should be an interesting watch .
If atheism is a religion , than yes and atheism . If it 's not then no . _________________
That 's questionable . In Casey , Scalia pointed out , `` But if in reality our process of constitutional adjudication consists primarily of making value judgments ; if we can ignore a long and clear tradition clarifying an ambiguous text , as we did , for example , five days ago in declaring unconstitutional invocations and benedictions at public high school graduation ceremonies , Lee v. Weisman , 505 U.S. 577 ( 1992 ) ; if , as I say , our pronouncement of constitutional law rests primarily on value judgments , then a free and intelligent people 's attitude towards us can be expected to be ( ought to be ) quite different . The people know that their value judgments are quite as good as those taught in any law school -- maybe better . If , indeed , the 'liberties ' protected by the Constitution are , as the Court says , undefined and unbounded , then the people should demonstrate , to protest that we do not implement their values instead of ours . '' Arguably , the language of the Second Amendment is ambiguous . Thus decades of controversy about its true meaning . But in Heller , Scalia decides that the court , not the people , should clarify such text .
I think the history of discrimination against gays does count as oppression . Being classified as a `` mental illness '' with cures that could possibly involve shock `` therapy '' , castration , or lobotomies , having our sex be illegal , the type of harassment we have seen which should make any civilized person blush ... I understand you think the `` oppression '' could be worse , but quite frankly how many minority groups have undergone what gays have undergone ? I mean , there is no competing with the atrocities committed against the blacks , and millions of Jews died in the holocaust ( along with gay people ) , but what more is required before you can look at gay history and not see it as `` oppression '' ?
With all due respect my friend , this is foolishness . It 's as if you 're saying that a persons existence is based on their memories from their past . That is ridiculous because if it 's true then , we oughta take every person who 's in the throws of Alzhiemers out and euthanize them because they ca n't remember what they did yesterday . Just because you ca n't remember what you did at 4 does n't negate for one moment that you still existed at 4 so your existence had value and substance even though you can no longer remember what happened back then in your life .
I think you 're over-complicating the anti-choice position . A majority of anti-choice posts I 've read are essentially based on their 2000 year-old mythical belief system , when women were not considered a particularly valuable portion of society for tasks other than child bearing and scullery purposes . Unless , of course , capable of immaculate conception , still unproven , yet enjoying dogmatic status . If you refute those mythical beliefs , regardless of any country 's constitution , to those posters you 're actually less than a piece of real estate and definitely non-human , male or female .
And I suppose they are also responsible for the evolution of utterly insane mental cases such as yourself ? And for electing GBII . And for Saddam Hussein . And for the drought in the South currently . And for cancer and AIDS . And heck why stop there why not for the Devil himself . All those sodomites must have become the original demons in hell I suppose .
23,000 firearms were handed in when the UK had its gun ban . According to your logic those people that handed in their firearms can still be prosecuted because they took possession of a firearm prior to the ban . I do n't think so .
I see no stigmatism either .
Do you want something other than peppered moths , bacteria developing resistance to antibiotics , Darwins finches , and the other species of the Galapagos ? Maybe biologists are not allowed to do tests on animals that will kill many of them . This reminds me of Kent Hovind 's reward for evidence of evolution : impossible to fulfill .
Oh , I do n't think there 's anything wrong with it , I 'm completely for it .
But the point is why are there relatively few creationists . The reason is that the creationist position can not be defended in open debate . That is why creationist boards censor opposing views . On boards where creationists are not protected there are few .
Maybe they do n't want to know . Why should some busybody force them into a predicament that they do n't want to be in ? In this country , every born person has freedom of choice !
Exactly . It is their fault , but they can do what they choose . It is punishment and you know it , and it is not your job to make sure no `` irresponsible '' pregnant woman goes unpunished .
Well this is what i am saying . The probability of a and b in one organism i very low . And the probability of A and B in many generations is lower than just A . This is what Behe deals with in his book . One reason evolution of primates interest me more than bacteria is the the number of organisms and generations is much much lower , and the changes involved must be pretty big . It involves Real evolution as opposed to stuff like antibiotic resistance or sicke cell haemoglobin that i see more as a reversable adaption , not a developement to a permanently better/more complex state . IMO there should be possible to make some sort of calculation regarding the probability of RM being cause of the changes .
and where did they find the participants for this study , bath houses and bars ? Gay men are a hidden population in statistical relms . It is very hard to get a true random sample of data on gay men . Studies will say whatever the funder of the study wants it to say . You just get data from the right place . If you want gay men to look like raging alcoholics get your study participants in a bar . If you want them to look like sexaholics then you get your study subjects in bathouses . The truth is that to have honest statistical data you need RANDOM SAMPLES .
You know the answer , Matt . They 'd never accept it .
Exactly . If you are a child rapist and someone pops you in the head than you should go to jail for murder . Sorry , two wrongs do n't make a right .
Well , actually if the remainder is split between those who favor a marriage amendement and those who have no oppinion , yeah , actually 52 % regardless of the margin of error , is still definitatively a majority .
This is obviously not talking about abortion .
Well , it does say on the site `` Any concealed handgun permit holders who are eventually acquitted of their alleged crimes are not included in the tallies maintained on the site although the facts surrounding the shooting are detailed . '' So if you go to their pdf file you can still find out details about the very few cases that were acquitted or dismissed : http : //www.vpc.org/fact_sht/ccwtotalkilled.pdf
Even the ones that are destined to go extinct without producing any `` daughter '' species ? Apeart from that quibble though , you are right . But do n't tell the creationsts ; it 'll only confuse them
As proved above by definition of reason above , it all depends on what premise or starting assumption you have as to what conclusion you will reason out . You are correct that faith does not neccessary require evidence . But there is usually always evidence to support the validity of a particular faith , in this case Christianity .
So in other words your God put you on Earth to stop people from killing so your God could kill them eventually ?
Just some interesting information I learned when we went caving a couple years ago ( a real cave , not one of the commercialized ones ) . Bats actually have better eyesite than humans , but even they ca n't see in pitch black . No eye can .
It 's wonderful that we as humans can do to help others through procedures like this . Very happy for this little girl . I am , however , astonished and outraged that our CITIZENS in the UNITED STATES have to go to CHINA to get a treatement like this to help them . It is absolutely disgusting what is happening to our country due to religious nuts/fundies who oppose stem cell research and various other advances in science . Sometimes I think they wo n't be happy until this country becomes a third world country at least techologically and scientifically .
maybe , but see , that does not match the materialist universe ?

Humm . More guns , more Concealed Carry and Violent Crime and Murder is down to it 's lowest levels since they started to record it . So how can these studies be credible or considered in anyway correct .
And there is also no question that sleeping doctors are harmful . I 'm saying that owning a gun is less dangerous than seeing a doctor .
What 's your point ? Of course they will be bound by Heller just as the courts are bound by Roe v. Wade . That point was n't in dispute . As long as you 're talking about 19th Century Second Amendment case law , I like The State v. Buzzard ( 1842 ) .
And how does this compare to your ideas on artificial selection ?
Here 's a novel idea - how about the right gives up the abstinence programmes ( scientifically unproven ) and improves access to and information on b/c to stop women having UPPs in the first place ? Just a thought .
How extraordinary that Catholic theologians understand the Old Testament better than the folks who wrote it because they `` have more books to understand that passage . '' Yeah , there has been a lot of Catholic blather written to obfuscate the Bible .
Greater legal minds than yours or mine see laws against same-sex marriage as unconstitutional `` limiting '' . Quibble with them if you want , but that 's how they put it .
And these are psalms , which are just popular prayers rather than the word of God ar n't they ? Rather than go with the slightly bizarre 'well you 're not King David are you ... ' type response , I could see it being fairly reasonable that God 'knows ' people who are born . He might 'know of ' the various individuals who are misscarried , die at birth or are aborted but what exactly does he know in relation to them ? Do our souls have their own personalities completely seperate from our mortal ones that are shaped as much by our souls as genes and experience - or does God 'know ' them through the billions of other possible universes , i.e he knows them from somewhere/when they did n't die . But if that counts then that means our souls are spread out over an infinite number of copies of us . If so then surely the threat of Hell is irrelevant , either we are doomed because clearly some version of reality has us being evil ( I 've seen enough TV shows to know that this is pratically 100 % certain . ) or the soul is something seperate from us and our actions ?
That 's the opinion I hold , that CCWs should n't be required . But this thread assumes that CCWs are required .
Well , I would agree that as many constitutional ammendments probably would not have passed , but I certainly do n't think they all would not have been passed , and I do n't think that Massachusettes allowing same-sex marriage was a bad thing . Constitutional ammendments are difficult to overcome , but no one can ever change a law if people are n't willing to take a stand and fight for it . Can you tell that I love the quote in Jyoshu 's signature ?
Oh yes , of course . But thats assuming that the unfit populations actually survive long enough to breed . On the average , fit populations of a specie breed more than unfit populations of the same specie .
Personally , I believe that god does n't exist , and I have a link , too ! By the way , sorry for all the links , but I have found that since creationism has been so well refuted elsewhere , I do n't have to do too much work . It also helps that I 'm presenting evidence , right ?
That 's right , a higher view of the fetus than there currently is typically in our culture . I have no problem with anyone referring to it that way .
What I saw was that if the finch are evolving a smaller beak because of the larger billed `` recent immigration , '' than that is a fast change for when the idea of evolution is gradual change over a long period of time , unless I misinterpreted it . But then again , I think it 's possible that `` micro-evolution '' does happen in some birds such as finches .
Or , given that this is about feasts , a waist is a terrible thing to mind .
And so , your goal is not to reduce abortions ? Your goal is to educate people on sexual activity and pregnancy ?
Just because somebody calls it `` therapy '' does n't mean it 's about fixing a `` disorder '' . People can have surgery to make themselves look prettier with fuller lips , bigger breasts , a tighter face . That does n't mean having less full lips , small breasts , or an aged face is a `` disorder '' .
No , it is you young padawan learner ... that has been mislead , some of the most famous and noted Darwinian Naturalists such as Crick , Huxley , Lipson ... and others have admitted to their own discredit that the entire theory of evolutions rests on chance , here ... but here , lets burst that bubble for you a bit more :
You have much to learn , my young padawan .
Botched abortions are one of the causes of death , but the primary causes of death are bleeding , infection , high blood pressure and prolonged labor . And , if abortion were safe and legal and offered as an option during the early term of a pregnancy , particularly in the case of young girls , that cause of death would be dramatically reduced .
But ... but ... I just swallowed 56 zygotes so that they could vote by proxy through me for the Ripofflican ( tm ) party this upcoming election so they can win . Now I 'm going to have all that indigestion for nothin ' . As to driving ... do n't care . What I 'll miss most is all of those credit card offers that come in their names . There 's just so much that they , living though me want to 'buy now and pay later ' on . You saying they ca n't do that ?
Churches are not locking up astronomers today !
yes , and it is also a complex train of economics leading down all the way to your door .
Sounds like liberal XXXX . Fighting hunger ... tztz
Got that right . Yankeefanwill refuse to define what he means as it allows him to reject everything that proves we are right . Notice he does n't define what a new body part means . Notice his reply to Symbiote . He 's not interested in the real definition of evolution and how it works . He 's attempting to 'refute ' evolution based on his own strawman . It 's a classic creationist tactic . Never discuss honestly the issue but attempt through dishonest methods to refute evolution . Our failure to meet yankeefan 's strawman criteria will only prove to rational people that his strawman is poorly designed . But to an avid creationist who has been annihilated on another board over and over again , it will feed his ideology that his evidence free belief is valid . Of course it 's still a false dichotomy , but logic , reason and facts are not found in YEC creationism .
Cars do n't breed . Or did n't you know that ?
Well , I still do think so . Never did I receive any scientifically reasonable answer to that . ( I 've asked many `` authorities '' )
That is your belief . You 've no evidence provided other than it is just your belief .
And creationism was investigated and explored completely and shown to be false .
And yet you seem to feel we should leave these issues to the government , which has done nothing but corporate takeovers in regard to banks , automotive industries , and now health care .
The scope of the conference was ONLY the discussion of illicit weapons trade on the international market . It had nothing at all to do with the ownership of weapons by private individuals EXCEPT as it pertained to the illicit sales of arms on the international market . THATS IT . NOTHING ELSE . They were not debating private ownership of arms , and such debates were discouraged . When a group from handgun control inc. attempted to give a presentation , they were politely told that the the scope of the conference did NOT include privae gun ownership by individuals . HEre is a link to the UNs goals : http : //www.un.org/millenniumgoals/ They run from word hunger to economic reform to higher educational standadrds . There is nothing there about guns . Here is a link to their news page : http : //www.un.org/News/ You can also get a newsletter from them that is mailed right to your door every day to be read at your leisure . I do n't really have any feelings about the UN one way or the other . They are a large force that helps shape world politics , so I follow what is going on there .
It 's just incredibly bad fact-twisting .
Well , one has to use something to make the Constitution say something that it does not say ; especially if it does n't say something that one really , really , really wants to have .
Oh vey ! Vat du they say about the U.S . Marshals service committing more crimes than people they have actually arrested for a crime ?
You know why . Because they want you to stop posting . Most of them want to rant , and they do n't want their rants challanged . It 's typical of the whole evolutionary community , I 'm afraid . Obvious_child and I are exploring this up in the `` numbers '' thread .
The first refutation is not a refutation at all - it is a retreat . No longer is God all-poweful , but he is all-powerful within the realm of logic . That reminds me of the guy in Monty Python 's Life of Brian who says `` Besides the sanitation , the education , the aqueduct , the public order , etc . what have the Romans ever done for us ? '' The second refutation sounds like something Rousseau said , along the lines of `` I do n't care about logic . I 'll believe in God privately . '' If one can claim that the power of God is beyond logic , but still true , then one can also claim that the powerlessness of God is beyond logic , but true . Similarily , I can claim that `` 2+2=5 '' is true by saying `` We humans are too simple-minded to understand it , therefore it must be true . '' That 's fallacious .
Well , that 's at least one helluva way to say good bye .
But would an all-powerful being having done it have spontaneously occurred to you had no one told you to take their word it was a fact ?
But a slightly larger brain than average is still feasible and offers enough of a benefit in a large social group that its worth the price - however something the size of a modern humans brain is far too demanding . That slightly larger brain can be supported by an organism or society that has n't developed fire , but is also able to discover the uses of it , from then on nutrician is n't the big limiting factor that restricts how big a brain can get from then on .
I think that the type of weapon does make a difference . A tyrant would be more dangerous to the world if he was armed with WMDs rather than knives .
Well this involves the free will / determinism debate , you say you are n't free if your preferences are implanted ... I say you are free when you act in accordance with your preferences , regardless of how those preferences were arrived at . I think to claim you need to `` choose '' your preferences is absurd , as the act of choosing requires prior preferences , which presumably also required a choice ... . and the question of how we acquired our first preference arises ...
To the extent that working toward social change on any moralistic issue is an 'imposition ' , sure . But I think one could say that about anything that has a social effect .
Do you want anyone to take you seriously ?
Actually , it is based on the `` common sense '' that you put down . Thank you for posting .
Oh dear . Have you ever looked at a human spine ? It is curved : it 's bent . A straight spine is a knackered spine . As to the hands bit , what are you on about ? You are aware I hope that the story that the nosey elephant got it 's trunk because a crocodile grabbed the end and stretched it is just a story ?
Because that 's self defeating . If they said that , they 'd be admitting that evolution is correct and that literal creationism is wrong as what we see today was built off of the sciences that support evolution .
Because I do n't feel like copying and pasting articles into a forum when they can be easily accessed online . But for a quick summary : The CCR-5 gene mutation is present in about 15 % of caucasians , with 1 % having the homogeneous version . These 1 % are completely immune . The heterogeneous people possess some immunity .
No Christian sin ? ? ? Other then the intent to kill and then doing so
** The `` methodology '' of science is not materialism/mechanism/darwinism , but simply empiricism leading inductively/abductively to hypotheses regarding regularities in causation in nature that can be tested via the predictive experimentation of the scientific method . Neither empiricism or the epistemological process of the scientific method are the exclusive property of materialism/mechanism , nor did they originate from within that metaphysic , despite the beliefs of materialist/mechanists to that effect . Unfortunately , some 150 years ago , that methodology was set aside , and has remained out of sight , with regard to the hypothesis that is generally referred to as 'darwinism ' .
They are not exactly the same . See the examples above . It is not random .
Fossils are evidence , not theory . They can be used in the construction of any theory , including creationism . Whether this is 'just ' or not , is another issue . I point this out as many seem confused about evidence , and think that it just points to something without interpretation
FDR saved this country ? If I recall , it was in 1933 that , because of a combination of weakened capital situations from Reconstruction Finance Corporation loans which published lists of the loan takers , and a nation-wide banking holiday , banks around the country went through a new wave of demise , dropping the D/C and D/R ratios so sharply that , in one month alone , the money stock ( M2 ) fell a whopping 4 1/2 % . Wasnt it under FDR that the NIRA codes , and , after 1935 , the NLRA , enacted minimum wages , driving up nominal wages and thus unemployment ? Wasnt it during FDR administration that the reserve ratio was *doubled* , sending us back into another recession starting 1937 ? The only thing FDR `` saved '' was the depression for a couple more years . -GFA
SNIP This is n't evidence , this is an opinion piece made by someone with an agenda . Come back when you have something of substance .
First of all rape is one of the most under-reported crimes so it makes sense that abortion due to rape/incest is also under-reported so that makes your assumptions and numbers off.But of course you are missing the whole point.You are not the one being raped so it is n't YOUR choice.I do n't need you making choices for me or telling me what is and is n't good for my emotional health.If one gets raped and DOES NOT want to be pregnant who are you tell them they have to be ? Abortion should be legal for everybody who wants one not just rape/incest victims , for the simple reason that no human being has the right to substain life by using the body of another why should a fetus have more rights than actual persons ?
You make the supposition that before the NRA got to a politician that he/she was in a state of purity before . Q : How can you tell when a politican is telling a lie ? A : When their lips move .
Assuming this right exists ... .you could say that you have no right to kill it though , you can only try to starve it . -You have consented sex and get pregnant . The pregnancy is a direct consequence that was known when having sex . -You have consented to a stranger coming into your house to eat dinner . The stranger coming in and sitting down and using your plates and eating your food is a direct consequences of you inventing him in for dinner . -If you say you do n't want the unborn to `` live off you '' anymore then the only thing you can do is starve it because you ca n't kill it as it did nothing that it was not allowed to do until just now . -You have decided the stranger must go , however , you do n't have a right to kill him right there as you did n't give him any reasonable time to leave .
Just another bogus reason for having and abortion ... ... ... ... There are thousands of them ... ... ...
Really , with C being between 1/2 and 2 million defensive gun uses per year . Or perhaps the hundreds of millions of legal , non-defense related , gun uses per year . When you compare the number times a guns are used legally to the number of times they are used illegally , B becomes pretty insignificant .

You think open carrying of loaded handguns in public will become fashionable in CA ? I think if anyone took to this they 'd find themselves asked to leave establishments routinely .
Well I 'm not sure you are if we consider my attitude non-Christian . You argued that Islam was atheism , that Shinto and Buddhism were atheism . Furthermore you refuse to actually back up any of your arguments and when push comes to shove , you resort to these kind of arguments . But perhaps you are n't a Christian , but instead a Biblist . Someone who worships the Bible as their God .
How curious that not everyone can admit that this kind of treatment is wrong . How interesting that another issue comes up instead of addressing the blatant , in-your-face kind of mistreatment of an individual making a private , personal decision . Like many decisions in life , this is one that is difficult to come to . It does n't mean it 's a wrong one . It 's hard because your options are so very serious .
So what the hell does that have to do with anything ... oh and do not tell me that the AWB was the reason ... Assault weapons are used in less than .20 % of crimes : `` Assault weapons are not the weapons of choice among drug dealers , gang members or criminals in general . Assault weapons are used in about one-fifth of one percent ( .20 % ) of all violent crimes and about one percent in gun crimes . It is estimated that from one to seven percent of all homicides are committed with assault weapons ( rifles of any type are involved in three to four percent of all homicides ) . However a higher percentage are used in police homicides , roughly ten percent . ( There has been no consistent trend in this rate from 1978 through 1996 . ) Between 1992 and 1996 less than 4 % of mass murders , committed with guns , involved assault weapons . ( Our deadliest mass murders have either involved arson or bombs . ) `` Whats your point ?
Actually I think most people DO realize this .

Note the operative word is particular . The point being there are a miriad of people who can take on the responsibility of a born child . That is not the case in pregnancy .
Or should we go to federal coda pertaining to the militia ?
I love this line . I assume by `` harm '' you mean an actual physical harm or some kind or another ( physical in this case includes loss of items ) . So this would cut our laws in half . Walk around naked ? No big deal ! Have sex on the street why doing cocaine ... go for it ! Drunk in public ? Who cares ! The list can go on forever .
I 'll just address this , if I may . My working definitions of faith and science are more or less as follows . Science is a belief system based on observation , logic , and reasoning . Faith is belief in the absence of proof . Now this is n't to say that one must adhere only to faith or only to science . I 'm a firm adherent to the scientific method , but I believe many things that ca n't be proven true . However , in any situation where the truth or falsehood of a statement can be proven , I yield to science . It seems to me that faith can only justifiably be applied to areas that do n't yield themselves to scientific analysis . If the truth or falsehood of a statement can be determined , then turning to faith for an answer seems to be to be an act of self deception . So I have to disagree with you . I think that science and faith are very different tools , which can only properly be used in distinct arenas .
Well , all this abstract and analytical thinking strikes me as anything but mechanical and/or accidental .
No Steve , I realise that there are hetersexuals who practice that filthy pastime of anal sex and other sex acts that the human body is not designed to do . Heterosexuals have no more business doing these things then homosexuals . Do you realise Steve that E Coli bacteria inhabit the rectum and are in feces ? Do you know how sick and E Coli infection can make you ? Sodomy is akin to having sex in raw sewage .
Oh - I agree it should be taught - it was just a thought as to why it maybe is not .
Oh I can easily spend $ 1,000 dollars an hour . If I could I would also have plenty of reason to live to be 114 .
Do n't forget adoption . The other option is to have the baby checked with what is called `` genetic counseling '' . At 5 and 1/2 weeks it is unlikely there is significant damage . You can have doctors test for it first . There are lots of folks that would be willing to adopt a child who has those challenges . Do not give in to despair . If you choose an abortion , you may regret it far more than you regret smoking and drinking heavily . My wife has wept over hers . This is a big decision . Please get counsel from those that know you and who you can trust . EF

Why is it you assume I 'm doing nothing about it ? Do you know how many charities I support which serve in Africa ? The question is , what are you doing about it since it is only you whom you have complete control of . Think about actually contributing to programs like Doctors without borders rather than question my giving when it has already been proven on multiple threads that it is conservatives who contribute the lions share to charities in this country . All the liberals do is whine , complain and raise taxes so someone else will have to support their pet programs .

Weird , str8 atheists have been civilly marrying for eons without special stipulations - Good As You : : Gay and Lesbian Activism With a Sense of Humor Meh ... . I personally think `` religious protection '' is much adieu over nothing , as the EXISTING first amendment adequately protects . With interracial marriage , we did n't have churches `` forced '' to perform interracial marriages they did n't want to perform . The same would be true of gay marriage , and I have yet to see a U.S. example disproving the protection of a church from not having to perform the gay marriage , and/or not having to allow it within their private church . But whatever ... The legislature can easily make these changes , if the governor is accurate in saying that is all the changes amount to . New Hampshire could soon be state # 6 ...
Interesting , but it appears to ignore the fact that there is pre-existing variation ( just look at the pictures ) . Emphasizing mutations is ok , but relying solely on them will probably skew results .
Milesian Race vs Anglo-Saxon race . They just happen to be Protestants and Catholics . Sorry , I should have known that would be over your head .
Notice that even in this version there are elipses just before the quote in question . My bet is if we were to actually refer to this 44 years old book , Simpson would not be saying what Toxey wants him to say .
The first article is from 2002 and the second one is from 2006 , molecular genetics changed massively over that period of time with the completition of the human genome project and the development of new technology . What they would be looking at and comparing would have changed drastically as well , from just the genes in the first case ( the 99 % figure ) and everything in the second ( 94 % ) .

And here ladies and gentlemen we have the evidence of why I am justified in calling the likes of `` stormboy '' an XXXXX . The guy tries to discuss science when he is so utterly lacking in basic science that he thinks that the earth spins to `` keep [ s ] the oceans from falling off towards the sun '' ... stormboy , there is a thing called gravity : it is what `` keep [ s ] the oceans from falling off towards the sun '' . Now please go away and get an education , then when you have even the faintest idea of what you are talking about ( which you currently do not ) , come back and attempt to debate . It will be for your own good as you are just making yourself look a prat by staying here .
Biological evolution does n't involve the formation of life nor is it a rule that life can only come from life . It 's a tendency because it is vastly more efficient .
There are certainly more people who think that species evolve from earlier species than there are than people who think species evolve from later species .
Because guns are the best method available on the market . Settling for second best when you could have the best is just stupid . Better locks ? The best they 'll do is slow down the person seeking to harm you , their effectiveness is contingent on the strength of the door they 're on . Alarms ? So somebody will know that you 're in danger , what then ? That wo n't get the police there any faster than dialing 911 . Non-lethal weapons ? Somethings non-lethal is a non-option . Brandishing a can of pepper spray wo n't cause an attacker to flee for their life , it wo n't hold them at bay until the police arrive to arrest them , it wo n't stop a violent individual from across the room , and it sure as hell wo n't affect somebody that 's doped up on narcotics . And stun guns are more useless than knives , because as I 've said before , you need to get right up against your attacker to use them . You have to get within stabbing distance to shock them , do you really want that to be your best option for protecting yourself ? The idea is to keep the bad guy away from you , not let them get right next to you . All of these non-lethal devices , they set up the false notion that the life of a criminal intent on hurting or possibly killing you , is worth more than your own life . That belief is stupid and should be done away with . Ask any woman that 's ever been raped if they feel that their attacker deserves to live more than they do .
`` A pretty important '' ? Actually , not really . The ToE has evidence from all over the various domains of life . Human evolution is n't too much more relevant than bacterial evolution .
But then it also does n't answer the question `` does anything exist '' , nor does it answer an infinite number of `` existence '' questions . Do `` trolls '' exist , follows the same reasoning . If you find one , they are no longer a fairy tale/imaginary creature , they are some organic life form that can be measured , tested , and quantified..i.e . no longer an imaginary creature . So they can no more be found than god . So replace god/troll with an infinite number of other imaginary things and you 'll see why the question `` Does god exist ? `` , has no real importance in the physical universe . ( does the tooth fairy exist , does a unicorn exist , do flying pigs exist , etc . ) In fact , I like that statement . The existence of god is not imporant ... Rather - the FAITH in god ( s , etc . ) is what is `` important '' , and the thoughts most certainly exist in the physical world and have a measureable impact . I think that 's why I do n't mind so much `` religion '' per se , it 's the human condition that brings suffering , and uncertainty , into our lives and for some people , the feelings brought about by their faith seems to treat the condition . ( the human condition also brings joy , love , etc. , but I 'd like that without the pain personally ) I only mind it when things in the physical universe are `` attacked '' with the premise of belief in god ( s ) , which is a waste of human energy ... we have a limited time , do n't spend it using fallacy to undermine those who are actually trying to build on the foundation of human knowledge . And any belief in something without evidence scares me if it becomes a driving force behind decisions . ... she 's a witch because she MADE the crops die ... she must be burned . ... he broke `` god 's '' law and therefore must be guilty.. ... this is `` god 's '' war.. Yeah , that still scares me . That 's why I think , at least in the US , the seperation of church and state is so ridiculously important , and accepted . While there are fundamentalists that rail against it ... it 's hopefully obvious that with ~80 % of the US believing in an imaginary `` god '' , but also having a separation of church and state and the most generally advanced scienctific community in the world , then the two can obviously co-exist , and I 'd go so far as to say thrive as long as the line is drawn and not crossed . I learned something in responding , thanks for the spark . -Mach
Come back when you learn the difference between climate and weather .
I do n't know about capuchins , and I am not going to a website . However , I have read just about everything Jane Goodall has written , and I do not see chimps as being `` just '' . They willing hunt down old friends and kill them ( or help to kill them ) . In the Passion ( name of a chimp - Jane named hers ) case , the female monkey deliberately found other female members of her own tribe when they were alone and too far away for the others to hear cries of help , and with the help of her children ripped the babies from their mothers and proceded to eat them in front of the mothers . Then as if they had done nothing wrong they would go up and touch the mother `` lovingly '' .Some people can say these show human traits ( Jane does ) , however , while it is common for animals to kill and feel no remorse for it , many humans feel horrible remorse even if they were not directly responsible for killing another human . Some even feel remorse for killing animals . Whether you agree they are human traits or not , you must agree that most humans have some sense of justice . I do not see that sense of justice in all of Jane 's research .
Out-and-out lie . There 's really no other way to put this .

And it also took an amendment to give the slaves rights , not a judge .
Really . `` The voice of one crying in the wilderness : `` Prepare the way of the LORD ; Make straight in the desert a highway for our God . ( NKJV ) . '' Isaiah 40:3 `` In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea , and saying , 'Repent , for the kingdom of heaven is at hand ! ' For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah , saying : 'The voice of one crying in the wilderness : Prepare the way of the LORD . . . ( NKJV ) . ' '' Matt . 3:1-3 John the Baptist came before Jesus Christ and let people know that He was coming . What a fascinating period of history . This prediction was given by the prophet Isaiah , 740-680 B.C . History tell us that John the Baptist did in fact come preaching repentance and baptism . `` But you , Bethlehem Ephrathah , though you are small among the clans of Judah , out of you will come . . . one who will be ruler over Israel , whose origins are from of old , from ancient times ( NIV ) . '' Micah 5:2 `` After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea , during the time of King Herod . . . ( NIV ) '' Matt . 2:1 Micah , 735 - 710 B.C. , tells us that the Christ or Messiah will be born in Bethlehem . It is recognized by all that Jesus was indeed born in Bethlehem . Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign : Behold , the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son , and shall call His name Immanuel ( NKJV ) . '' Isaiah 7:14 `` Joseph , son of David , do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife , for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit . And she will bring forth a Son , and you shall call His name JESUS , for He will save His people from their sins . . . His name [ is ] Immanuel ( NKJV ) '' Matt . 1:20-23 . `` This is what the LORD says : `` A voice is heard in Ramah , mourning and great weeping , Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted , because her children are no more ( NIV ) . '' Jer . 31:15 `` When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi , he was furious , and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under . . .then the [ prophecy ] was fulfilled ( NIV ) . '' Matt . 2:16-4:1 Through the prophet Jeremiah , 627 - 580 B.C. , God indicated that some of Israel 's children would be killed at the coming of the Messiah . `` When Israel was a child , I loved him , And out of Egypt I called My son . '' Hosea 11:1 `` Now when they had departed , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream , saying , `` Arise , take the young Child and His mother , flee to Egypt , and stay there until I bring you word ; for Herod will seek the young Child to destroy Him . When he arose , he took the young Child and His mother by night and departed for Egypt , and was there until the death of Herod , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet , saying , `` Out of Egypt I called My Son . '' ( NKJV ) . ' '' Matt . 2:13-15 This prophecy was given by the prophet Hosea around 750 B.C . This amazing prophecy says that Messiah would come from Egypt . Jesus had to be born into the family of David , born of a virgin , born in Bethlehem , children would die and Jesus come out of Egypt . The prophet must have wondered why Messiah would come out of Egypt . This did not fit the concept the Jews had about Messiah . This is God 's plan and these are God 's prophecies . `` They divide my garments among them , and for my clothing they cast lots ( NKJV ) . '' Ps . 22:18 `` Then they crucified Him , and divided His garments , casting lots , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet : `` They divided My garments among them , And for My clothing they cast lots ( NKJV ) . '' Matt . 27:35 After the soldiers crucified Jesus ( nailed Him to the cross ) , they gambled for Jesus ' clothes . Little did they know they were fulfilling a 1000 years old prophecy . The prediction was provided by God through King David . `` I will pour on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and supplication ; then they will look on Me whom they pierced ( NKJV ) . '' Zech . 12:10 `` But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear , and immediately blood and water came out . For these things [ occurred ] that the Scripture should be fulfilled . . . `` They shall look on Him whom they pierced ( NKJV ) . '' John 19:34-37 Another isolated event predicted in 520-512 B.C . In A.D. 33 , some soldier thrust his spear into the side of Jesus to make sure that He would die before 6 pm that evening . Little did he realize that Jesus was already dead ( John 19:30 ) and that he was fulfilling a 480 year old prophecy from Zechariah . `` Even my own familiar friend in whom I trusted , who ate my bread , has lifted up His heel against me ( NKJV ) . '' Ps . 41:9 `` Judas Iscariot . . . betrayed Him . '' Matt . 10:4 `` that the scripture might be fulfilled , 'He who eats My bread has lifted up his heel against Me ( NKJV ) . '' John 13:21-28 This prediction was recorded by King David , 1020 - 970 B.C . It refers to the Messiah 's betrayal by His friends . Judas is well known as the one who agreed to help the Romans capture Jesus at a cost of 30 pieces of silver . Peter was another who betrayed Jesus three times . `` See , your king comes to you , righteous and having salvation , gentle and riding on a donkey , on a colt , the foal of a donkey ( NIV ) . '' Zech 9:9 `` And the disciples . . . brought the donkey and the colt , and laid on them garments , on which he sat . And most of the multitude spread their garments in the road , and others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them in the road ( NIV ) . '' Matt . 21:6-8 Zechariah , 480 - 470 B.C. , stated that Messiah , the king , would come riding on a donkey . Donkeys were sometimes ridden in times of peace ( Judges 5:10 ) but stallions were normally used by kings . This is unexpected by those looking for a military Messiah . If you want more just ask .
Evolutionary scientists is a confusing term . A geochronologist might work out an age for a lava sample for example . Astronomers have also made comment on the age of the earth as have paleontologists studying certain fossils . So why would no flood make radiometric much more likely to accurate as you say ? Can we hear some specific detail on this as it is kinda significant to backing you your assumption .
Either a gross misunderstanding or a gross misrepresentation of evolutionary theory .

You could put the stranger out even if they had nowhere to go and it was freezing cold out .
Just those in places where CCW is already legal . If you can carry in your state , you can now carry in Nat'l parks ... in that state . If you live in Illinois or Wisconsin , you must do like everyone else : call 911 out on the trail , wait for police to find you , then protect you from the rapist who has patiently waited for them to arrive . I ca n't figure it out . This law simply makes it legal for those who have their CCW to carry in Nat'l parks too . They ALREADY carry everywhere else . The Brady bunch makes it sound like there 's something about the border of a park that will make us drooling , neanderthal gun owners flip our lids ... .but just in the park . Why are we perfectly safe everywhere else , but all of a sudden , we 're dangerous ... ... in the park ?
The ban on assault weapons stands on such poltically weak and Constitutionally weak ground that Congress only had the guts and the will to try it for 10 years . It expires this year . The right to own arms is expressly clear . It shall not be infringed by Congress . The federal government is fully empowed to keep arms away from convicted fellons , it does not have the power to limit them from citizens . Those people who `` you do n't know ( what they may do ) '' ? When the government is effective enough to prevent crime or has the power to do so , then we no longer live in a free society . Keep in mind that free choice also allows a person to decide to break the law . It cuts both ways , you can not take away the choice to break laws and allow good citizens truely be free . The only governments through history that have been effective in crime prevention has been tyranically communist countries with extensive secret police . The present people in former communist block countries today are sad to see thier streets full of crime , they recall `` back in the day '' how safe it way to walk down dark streets in saftey . Yes they were safe from criminals , they were not safe from the secret police . The moment the secret police eyed you for real or imagined statistical probability of breaking a crime or become a political enemy , you dissapeared and no one ever saw you alive again . The WMD analogy is poor . You will not find any vendors . Please find another one . There may be Constitutionally poor arguments in favor of banning WMDs for civilians , that argument is moot . You will not find any vendor . The Constitution protects my right to own arms . That does not mean arms vendors must be forced to sell thier product to me if I want one . That argument is moot . The Firearms Act decided that sawed off shot guns and the Thompson machine gun is to be banned from civilian ownership . Early Supreme court DECISIONS support this . Early judicial opinion of the the Firearms act was based on the fact that the Thompson and sawed off shot gun was not a military serviceable weapon and does not apply to the 2nd Amendment . The Thompson and sawed off shotgun were not used by the US Army . Guess what ? The Thompson was adpoted by the Army a few years later . So then , what does that mean ? Judicial opinion is of the direction that military serviceable weapons are protected by the 2nd Amendment . What does that mean for the assault rifle ban ? It means it is on shakey Constitutional ground . Some points I have for you : 1 ) Flash supressor ? Argued by anti-gunners prevent shooters from hiding thier position . Completely false . Flash hiders can hide flash from the target . It 's main purpose is to hide flash from the SHOOTER ! The flash startles the shooter and makes bullets ballistically unstable : `` Excessive muzzle flash happens when unburned powder ignites at the muzzle , causing turbulence behind the bullet with a detrimental effect on accuracy . '' - http : //www.shootingsoftware.com/loadens.htm Flash has more to do with the ammo than the attachment on the end . The Flash hidder ban has lowered target shooting scores more than protecting lives . 2 ) Magazine limit ? Argued by anti-gunners to save lives . Argued to prevent rapid and large expendature of rounds down range upon victims . True , but how often do you hear that ? When it does happen it is national news . The real threat is from guns that contain more 2 less than 4 bullets : http : //ip.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/2/151 The anti-gunners know this and are comming after your 6 shot revolvers next . They just wanted people to started getting used it to idea of banning bullet capacity . So then . The ban on more than 10 bullets ? It really does not do anything than give a false sense of security . If public policy productive and actally do something , then the ban on 10 bullets is a farce . 3 ) Bayonet ? I can not even fathom a reason to ban them other than emotional reasons . Simly because they look dangerous I suppose is why they are banned . Will someone please let me know ? Public policy should not be based on emotional reasons to be truely good and effective policy . 4 ) Pistol grip ? They make controling an automatic weapon easier to sight on your target . Well then , if you rifle is semi-auto , then what reason is there to ban them ?
But you are using the word theory incorrectly . Since part of your discussion purports to be about science , one might make the mistake that you are using the word `` theory '' with a scientific connotation . You are not . What you are talking about is folk mythology , not theory .
Yet every good deed they do is ruined by their war against us . Until they stop this war upon us , their attacks on our families , and their fight to remove our freedoms through the tyranny of the majority at the ballot box , I will continue to consider them evil , destructive , and enemies of freedom . Remember even Hitler did some good for the German people all the while committing evil acts .
You 've got ta love when ignorance lends itself to incredible mistakes like the above statement . `` Excepting '' that there is some magical sky man is precisely what atheists do . Looks like we have another Einstein who wants to test his opinions with people who actually know what they 're talking about . lpdm , you 'd better learn quickly , or I do n't think you 'll like it here as much as you were hoping .
Bull hockey . Precautions occasionally fail . You can make an argument against the `` irresponsible '' pregnancies , but you ca n't lump every abortion into the group . Even Archie ran away when I nailed him on this one .
I do n't know how this can be true . Thank God that I did n't grow up with my biological father . I 'm not really interested in being a jerk .
I personally think you go after the butcher abortion doctor and prosecute him ... ..
And seven-point harnesses are the best types of seat belts . But most people are perfectly happy with the seat belts that come standard in most cars .

I think you may have missed this part of the article .
Actually , if I 'm the one paying for it , then I should be allowed to find a way to make it cost me less . There 's no such thing as a free abortion .
Then you are just throwing around words without knowing what they mean . Instead you give me a link to a page of pseudoscience . Are those the ones who lied to you ?
I think I 'm getting what you are saying here , and I sort of agree . It is both the body and the mind that make a person , and each are important . If you have one without the other- the body ( very underdeveloed in this case ) without the mind in the case of a foetus , it does not make a person . I do think anti-choicers value both the same , even if one exists without the other . In their case I would ask them if they value a person who was recently deceased , where the cells of the body are still living , but there is no mental existence . I also beleive you are right in saying most pro-choicers do not place as high a value on a foetus ( which is not a person ) as they do on the woman ( who is a fully developed person ) . There is not as much of an empathy toward the foetus as it is not a person , and not as valuable as the woman . Since it is growing in the woman , it only makes sense that she decide what to do as it is her body .
Once again as the noose tightens and they see their days are numbered . The religious elite feel their power and hold over the masses slipping . With Iowa and Vermont being major victories they 'll stop at nothing to instill fear and confusion upon the American people to try and stem the tide that has been long overdue in rising .
How tolerant . Lets talk about the Spanish Inquisition .
I think reason why the `` hypothesis validated '' card has been played here is because : 1 . The time window for the expected transitional form is about ~20 ma , a narrow window by geological timeframes . Given this the researchers examined the stratigraphic column to select locatities where the rocks were of the corresponding age and selected sites accordingly . 2 . Tiktaalik was expected to live in a certain type of environment , and this expectation was used to further narrow the localities that would be explored as potential deposits for containing the expected `` transitional '' form . 3 . Having selected the locality , expeditions were mounted and successfully recovered remains of the anticipated beastie . Upon analysis it was found to lie in terms of evolutionary development between the most derived/advanced fish and most primitive tetrapods that had been previously known . Given the huge expanse of the Earth 's surface 1 and 2 helped the researchers select comparitively tiny areas to examine and the fact they found what they ( roughly ) expected to find says their hypothesis ( we will find remains of transitional form x at locality y ) was borne out . If no remains had been found then further expeditions might have been successful and the hypothesis could of been validiated at a later date . If they had found , lets say a more primitive form than the previously most advanced fish or a more advanced tetrapod than the previously most primitive form then I think that might amount to a falsifiaction . Having said all that I think that to claim a hypothesis was validated in this instance is slightly confusing as palaeontology is like archeology- you can never be 100 % sure everthing has been found and one small discovery can force a rethink of what that had been established up to that point . Also , IIRC , none of the three articles in nature make any reference to a hypothesis being validated I 'd describe it more as being an expectation being fufilled .
Because ...
That was a nice rant that had absolutely nothing to do with anything . The essential question is not what various religous leaders have said about the issue , but what the Bible says about the issue .
And there it is again ( twice in this post ) . Why do you keep equating christianity with YEC ? No one is denying that christians can do geology or any other science . YEC 's on the other hand , would be incapable .
I believe I am on record as not supporting registration of either handguns or long guns as long as NICS checks are conducted for all sales and transfers of ownership records are recoverable from FFL 's with a warrant .
As I mentioned above , science curriculums follow paths . One 's worldview plays heavily on one 's interpretation of scientific data . An agnostic , or atheist teaching establishment can become satisfied with one path of scientific theories without searching for others . There may be more to be discovered about thermodynamics , cell structure , irreducible complexity , the decay rate of the earth 's magnetic field , radiometric dating , the fossil record , and countless other things that a teaching establishment may not be interested in exploring , if it 's comfortable with it 's interpretation of current data 's indications that the happenstance origins worldview is correct . It goes back to what we touched on before - teaching students HOW to think , not WHAT to think .
For the gun banners who are thinking , you paranoid delusional low lives ! Uh . They have already tried . 57 % Say Gun Sales Up Due To Fear of More Gun Control
And they wonder why the science community does n't take them seriously ...
And how often has this actually occurred ? Maybe there are examples of this actually taking place to warrant it being a problem that needs addressing ? Or is this just your own personal belief ?
And I 've never seen anyone present observational evidence that would indicate that all creatures were specially created . Please do so .
And the point was , Benjamin , that it is dishonest to cite the work of others , with no indication that it is the work of others . If you take what someone else wrote , they you need to indicate that , telling where you got it . If it is a book , then the author , title , publisher , date and page . If it is a web page , then the URL should be given . Even better , express your own point and tell how reference supports it . Tell why it is important and why it shows your opponent wrong - then just give a link . Generally AIG is really bad science and is n't very interesting . It is misleading , intentionally . However , on these boards are familiar with their stuff .
Here 's a nice little Google def : A convinced belief ; a condition of mind fully satisfied ; next to actual knowledge . We have faith the sun will rise to-morrow morning , but the knowledge can not be actual until after sunrise . It appears that a Law or theorem is fundamentaly based on faith . If you could n't build on the belief that something will happen , we 'd be stuck never forming new hypostheses . You may have it backwards .
Do you think that the woman will not relive the rape on a daily basis if she destroys the child ? Not likely . I think she will still suffer through those thoughts . Killing the baby complicates this . What happens if she has horrible thoughts about a rape with more thoughts about the abortion ?
No , you are mistaken . Evolution is concerned with the change in allele frequency over time .
Actually , I am of the opinion that the fetus has no natural rights of its own . Any rights we grant to a person as a citizen or national are granted at the moment of birth . By granting equal rights to a 3week old fetus that you do to a 20 year old man , you are endangering the rights of the woman who carries that child . Yes , I believe that in most circumstances , the child should be carried to term , but there are exceptions to every rule , and I 'm not quite ready to forsake the lives and health of women to protect unborn children . Yes , I think the unborn child is worthy of protection , but not any more so than the mother , in fact probably less .
Nothing you 've ever said regarding classical evolutionary theory has ever ' # # # # # # ' me off , because in every case you have demonstrated contempt-fuelled ignorance of what it actually states . The number of incorrect statements you 've made about what 'darwinists think ' or 'darwinists believe ' or , quite recently , what darwinists ' materialist ideology 'forces them to assert ' is large and increases daily . And so long as you continue to batter your pet strawman of the ToE in preference to tackling the real deal , I wo n't have to 'defend ' anything ; I 'll just have to keep on correcting the same old mistakes .
Actually , I meant the behaviour refered to in her post was interesting .
Color is a function of the wavelength of light . Thus , quantum considerations aside , there are a nigh infinite number of colors . Humans , of course , can only see a subset of those colors , ranging from about 400 to 700 nanometers . In particular , our eyes have cells `` tuned '' to three ranges of wavelengths ; blue , red , and green . You could think of those as short , medium , and long wavelengths . By extrapolating from the relativity intensities from the particular cells we can `` figure out '' what wavelength is entering our eyes . http : //www.cambridgeincolour.com/tut ... perception.htm Does this dispell your confusion ? Edit : And just to address one other point , scientists are well aware of the limitations of the human eye . That 's why , when exact determination of color is important , machines that can read precise wavelengths are used , rather than relying on the known to be limited instrument which is the human eye .
I think that case was in Georgia ( a different state ) and so far as I know homosexuality was not involved . However if you want to worry about a legal case you need to look at Dover Pa. Not the sticker case in Cobb County .
Because if you can murder the unborn to prevent its suffering , you can murder the baby to prevent his suffering .
Apparently you 've got one powerful set of rose colored glassed . I guess you spend a lot of money on those 1-900 psychics too . Nowhere is it scientifically inaccurate ? Are you serious ? Waxy
Recall I mentioned your use of hyperbole earlier ? its in that sentence as well
just re-emphasizing
Actually , it 's not conjecture . The genetic makeup of the several subspecies of arctic foxes bear it out . The dominant allele is rare because it is less adaptive . The dominant allele is most likely ancestral . But even foxes below the Arctic circle show differences in their fur between summer and winter . So yes , foxes that were able to change color in the north had a differential reproductive advantage over those who could n't .
again , please explain what possible benefits you forsee with teaching intelligent design . Please show me where it is anything than a belief . Evolution was always considered science . It used the scientific method , and offered evidence for everyone to see and peer review . Until the `` theory '' of intelligent design does that , I will always be forced to put quotes around the word theory , because it will simply be a religious belief .
Please define `` climb upward '' and `` downhill slide '' in biologically meaningful terms . Please define `` degeneration . ''
the fact that the world is governed by laws of logic is exactly what eliminates god . since logic exists , god is not needed . i suppose you assume that logic needs an intelligent initiator of some sort in order for it to exist ? why ? logic dictate that adding quantity causes that quantity to increase . this would occur with or without god 's existence and needs no devine intervention to be consistently true . logic dictates that a system in equilibrium has a total of equal opposite forces and that the sum of all the forces in the system is 0. this is not contingent on god 's presmce either . the more explanations of phenomena that can be logically explained , the less god is needed . god and logic are indirectly proportionate . an increase in logic causes a decrease in god
At 13 - abortion , unless she is uniquely physically advanced . It 's incredible how many men are sure being pregnant is no big deal ... . Steve - regarding whether she can consent to abortion . Technically I do n't think a minor can consent to either sex or abortion in any state ( unless emancipated ) . I know that is how it is in Minnesota . I am sure the laws vary from state to state . Medical decisions generally fall to the parents . I know whether minors should have access to abortion without parental notifications is a controversial issue . On the surface one would think , of course not - but there is concern for those girls who are in abusive situations at home . And as I told VOR , if I had a daughter bound and determined not to tell me , I would rather she have access to safe abortion than resort to something drastic . A baby pregnant - yikes . Personally I think it 's innapropriate and dangerous for a little girl to carry a pregnancy to term . But I would sure love to simply avoid it through better prevention . I do not think an abortion would be anything but scary for her either - but technically , at that age , it would be safer . Steve - in no way , shape or form is a 13 year old ready for this - not physically , mentally or emotionally - not for pregnancy , and certainly not for parenting . I have a neices that old - good gracious - no way !
So many errors , where does one begin ? The entire specious claim that there are pygostylian Avialae which pre-date Archaeopteryx lithographica stems from Chatterjee 's most dubious fossil , `` Protoavis texensis , '' and Confuciusornis sanctus , which was initially described as dating from Tithonian horizons of the terminal Jurassic -- although subsequently Hou et al ( 1996 ) presented more conclusive evidence placing the confuciusornid material from the Barremian ( much to the chagrin of Alan Feduccia , who made much of Confuciusornis being from the Jurassic ) . As for `` Protoavis , '' the holotype and paratype are almost certainly composed of material which is not conspecific , and the material seems to correspond to a coelophysoid/drepanosaur chimera ( Paul 2002 ) , or a coelophysoid chimera ( Gauthier & amp ; Rowe 1990 ) . As for the Eichstatt Conference . It hardly concluded that Archaeotperyx was a `` true bird , '' it concluded that as opposed to the hypotheses of some ( e.g. , Thulborn 1976 ) , Archaeopteryx was indeed the most basal avialian , and not a less derived member of Coelurosauria . One would actually suggest referring to the published data from the conference , in Hecht et al 1985 , before continuing to make such assertions . Vindex Urvogel
Some ? 90 % is more than some in my opinion . That is a horrible waste . Just think if we could retain 50 % of the energy we consumed . We could start eating 1/5th of what we normally eat .
Are you saying shoes evolved or were the result of intelligent design ?
Well , if morality is simpy defined as : http : //www.answers.com/morality mo·ral·i·ty ( m & # 601 ; -r & # 259 ; l ' & # 301 ; -t & # 275 ; , mô- ) pronunciation n. , pl . -ties . 1 . The quality of being in accord with standards of right or good conduct . 2 . A system of ideas of right and wrong conduct : religious morality ; Christian morality . 3 . Virtuous conduct . 4 . A rule or lesson in moral conduct . I would say , based on # 1 , that any social structure that gives rise to acceptable and unacceptable behavior is an example of a moral system .
Well , who was the head of FEMA appointed by ? A brief googling seems to suggest a Mr. G.W . Bush was responsible , it would n't be entirely out of the question for dubya to appoint another member of the Christian right to this permission , who might be keen for Christian charities to be promoted . Other possible reasons are that religion is very strong in the south , and hence religious charities are more likely to have resources in the south , were the problem is . In any case , the red cross is by far the largest organisation involved , and as has already been estalbished is secular . And as I said before just because the organisations are Christian does n't necessarily mean that their workers or contributors are .
So now Wiesmann 's barrier is the most important thing to the ToE ? Somehow I doubt that biologists agree , but obviously creationists have more authority on the topic of evolution ...
I agree . I would n't have minded Bowling so much if he had either made a documentary or made a commercial film . In the end , the message was n't that bad . For all intenst and purposes he said exactly what the pr-gunners have been saying for years , which is that guns do n't kill , people kill . Now , he took a kind of roundabout means of getting there , but that was more or less the conclusion of the film . Our society is a messed up place and people are scared . I am not sure that he is right that they have no reason to be ( just look at our crime statistics ) . Watching the film , it almost looks like he set out to make one movie then ended up making another . The first 2/3 of the film certainly seemed like the message was `` guns are evil '' . It was n't until the end that you come to the revelation that his message is not `` guns are evil '' . The sensationalist methods he used in the film , IMHO , pretty much strike it from the `` documentary '' list .
Because there are people who are trying to deny the theory of evolution it 's place as a vital part of public school 's biology curriculum .
And , as you may have noticed , we 've been very successful at interpreting the data . We 've learned to do a lot of things as a result . One of the most important reasons scientists accept the theory is that it works .
Accidents happen , that 's just how life works . They 're tragic , and they 're upsetting , but there 's no way to avoid them .
Oh , but you do . The most intelligent students challenge the question and their answer and more often than not , win the challenge . The intelligent teachers recognize when they have written a poorly worded question as well . Only dullards can not think beyond the parameters . BTW , who appointed you net nanny ? Last time I checked , this was a public forum . Another thing , why are you righties so ANGRY all the time ?
True , but what i was trying to state is that the bible has little to do with christianity if you dont believe in it . I know many christians who believe in god , and jesus etc , but think the bible is completely false , and is only a book of fables . Thats what i was trying to imply .
Just when is it absolutely necessary to kill children ? Waiting until they are born likely gives them no more chance of surviving than killing them in the womb . What chance does an unexpecting child have against a grown person intent on killing him ?
Look at the % of threads that I start thast are anti-gay , then look at the % of gay posters ' threads that are anti-Christian . Do you see the dis-similarity in them ? I do n't start gay bashing threads , but all of you are obsessed with starting anti-religion threads . That certainly is n't going to win you any converts .
Wow ! You really have been paying attention to the Democratic smear campaign of the healthcare insurance industry , haven & # 8217 ; t you ? Did you also pay attention to their relative profit margins VS those of other industries ? It was 2.2 % ROI ! ! ! Banks make 10X that much and I don & # 8217 ; t hear your demagoguery directed at them . In fact over 35 other industries make higher profits than health insurance companies . Try doing some of your own research for a change and stop listening to DNC brainwashing . If they spent ½ of the time that they spend railing against the current healthcare insurance companies on something more pertinent , like shutting off the unlimited money supply to banks , this country would be able to pay for our , and probably Canada & # 8217 ; s , healthcare .
So I pray to chance every night before I go to bed ?
What ? !
Nearly all animal phyla* made their first appearance in the fossil record at essentially the same time , an interval of some 5 million years [ ET** ] ( about 525 to 530 million years ago [ ET** ] ) called the `` Cambrian Explosion . `` 51 Scientists have found that these early fossils exhibit more anatomical body designs than exist today , and that early animals , the trilobites , had eyes as fully developed as their counterparts today.38 Many of the Cambrian fauna , still survive today , all looking much like they did over 500 million [ ET** ] years ago . The prominent British evolutionist , Richard Dawkins , comments , `` ... [ W ] e find many of them already in an advanced state of evolution , the very first time they appear . It is as though they were just planted there , without any evolutionary history . `` 51 Two places in the world that have an abundance of early ( Cambrian ) fossils ; the Burgess Shale in the Canadian Rockies and the Chengjiang site in China.38 In Stephen J. Gould 's popular book , Wonderful Life , he points out that the Burgess Shale Cambrian fossils include `` a range of disparity in anatomical design never again equaled , and not matched today by all the creatures in the world 's oceans . `` 38 Further , these fossils contain some twenty to thirty kinds of arthropods*** that can not be placed in any modern group . The modern arthropods , consisting of almost a million species , can all fit into four major groups . But `` one quarry in British Columbia , representing the first explosion of multicellular life , reveals more than twenty additional arthropod designs . '' Today there are about 38 phyla in existence , but the Canadian , Chinese and other Cambrian sites reveal over fifty phyla.38 There has been a decrease in diversity ( probably due to global catastrophes ) . This is the reverse of what evolutionary theory predicts.38 Besides diversity , the Burgess Shale shows exquisite detail , right down to `` the last filament of a trilobite 's gill , '' or the last meal in a worm 's gut.38 The Chengjiang site has even greater detail , and is earlier . According to Paul Chien , the chairman of the biology department at the University of San Francisco , said the preservation is such that internal organs , nerves , and even the water ducts of jellyfish are observable.38 Researchers found striking similarities between the compound eyes of the Cambrian trilobites and those of modern insects . According to Riccardo Levi-Setti , `` Trilobites could see in their immediate environment with amazingly sophisticated optical devices in the form of large composite eyes . ... The number of individual optical elements in the compound eye could vary from approximately one hundred to more than fifteen thousand in a single eye , a range not very different from that found in modern insects . `` 38 The conclusion is that the eye , a complex visual system , was fully formed and functional extremely early in the fossil record . Obviously , this is not predicted by evolutionary theory.38 Until recently , the phylum of vertebrates had been considered a later arrival in evolutionary history . But not now ! Even the vertebrate phylum now extends into the Cambrian period , especially with the recent discovery of two fossil fish in China.51 The two new fossils . . . from Chengjiang are the most convincing Early Cambrian vertebrates ever found . The insects and other land invertebrates are also a very important group , and these practically all seem to be living fossils.51 These complex animals were present at the beginning of multicellular life and did not appear later as is predicted by evolutionary theory.38 Evolution does not explain the abrupt appearance of complex forms of life early in the fossil record or these fossils ' unequaled diversity . The implication of the Cambrian explosion of diverse , fully functional , and multicellular life is that evolutionary theory is falsified.38 Life did not start out simple and evolve into more complex and diverse animals ; it was complex and diverse right at the beginning . This contradiction between the fossil data and the predictions of evolutionary theory falsifies the theory.38 `` The facts of paleontology seem to support creation rather than evolution . All the major groups of invertebrates appear suddenly in the first fossiliferous strata . ( Cambrian ) of the earth with their distinct specializations , indicating that they were all created at almost the same time . '' - David Enock Associate Professor of Biology . BS Yeshiva College , MS Hunter College50 Even George Gaylord Simpson , Harvard high priest of evolution had to admit , In spite of the examples , it remains true ( as every paleontologist knows ) that most new species , genera and families appear in the record suddenly , and are not led up to by known , gradual , completely continuous transitional sequences.50 http : //www.straight-talk.net/evolution/explosion.htm
know all about Talk Origins . I was hoping to avoid `` argument by link . '' My hope is to here someone hear actually explain it in their own words , rather than using an evolution propoganda site .
Because the 'founding fathers ' were not as foolish and gullible as people like you ( especially , in foreign countries ) to believe that ANY form of government is above the possiblity of tyranny against it 's citizens .
Not only do their superiors in higher courts think they are a joke , but their peers in other circuit courts think they are a joke .
And here our Government recognizes : Rule of Law : Fundamental Rights of Citizens Democracies exist to serve their people
Really ? So why do the elderly marry ? Why do those who know they can never convieve children marry ? Why do those who actively refuse to have children marry ? Marriage is in no way `` simply a way of providing a stable home life for children '' at all . Marriage , today , is for compainionship and love .
So your only complaint was the use of the word `` assumption ? ''
What guy and what post ?
And because of HIPA , this action will not take place .
You know , men abort babies all the time without even thinking about it . If a man impregnates a woman , if he does n't want to take responsibility for his impregnation of that woman , all he has to do is walk . That 's how a man does abortion -- all the time . It is very difficult to legally get a father to take responsibility for children he has fathered . As a matter of fact , there are a number of really ugly customers in men , a great number of extremely hateful men :
No , but in some cultures they mutilate them for meaningless tradition .
But what about the married couple who know right up front they do not intend to have children , do n't even intend to try ? Do we ban them from marriage to ?
Not neccesarily . There may be a maniac hiding in your house . He does n't want his existance known , and you have no evidence he 's there . However , it will have a big impact on your reality when you wander into the room he 's in . Likewise , most modern Gods do n't seem inclined to demonstrate their existance , but most religions say that if you do n't do what their God says , there will be consequences when you die . I would say that if a diety ca n't go out of his way to demonstrate his existance and make clear what he wants , then I 'm not going to change the way I lead my life based on what people who claim to speak for him say . That 's not the same as saying that , if he exists , he does n't have some bearing on reality . We just may not know what it is , or it may only happen after we die .
The only state is Mass . and unless you use a friend 's address , they wo n't marry out of state couples .
These things are being taught in schools every day . Maybe the problem is that they 're not being reinforced at home . One 's role modeling starts with family .
You know , I make a poll about how creationists assume if not A , therefore B , and all you can do is fall directly into that ? I see you did not vote . It is a consensus . Unfortunately for you , the sciences that make up evolution are the sciences that bring us the modern world . If you are to deny that evolution is indeed true , you must therefore deny the modern world . And it amuses me to no end that you are doing falling right into if evolution false , therefore creation . Evolution 's validity is not argued on the falseness of Creation , where the only thing a Creationist can do is attack evolution . It is impossible for a creation to argue their belief is true on the basis of its merits alone . You are are proof of that . Arch made a series of posts in a thread asking for evidence of creation where all he did was attack evolution . Seriously ! Is your belief that weak that all you can do is assume a false dichotomy ? And here are 29+ evidences for evolution http : //www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/ , but I 'm not sure that is going to help , considering your showing of your understanding of the subject in general
I think I hear a bell dinging ! ! Ding ! Ding ! Let the round begin . Your giving me the invite , and I 'm willing to take it . Now I 'm not going to make any comments on your ex , or whatever he is to you . Because I do n't know him enough to assume anything about him . But I will make general statements on the effects of gay marriages on children . I have seen so many documents , on teens the are confused about their sexual orintation , because of living i the house with their gay parents . On girl wondered if she was gay because her mother was with another woman . She felt that was normal behavior . And started to concider being with girls herself . But was confused when she started to like men . She actually thought that liking men was abnormal . Until others told her it is normal to like men . A boy had almost the same experience , he did not know if he too should like men , because his father did . Often he would fight back desires for females , because he thought he needed to be with men . Not only that by he was ridculed by classmates because of his father being gay . Alot of children endure harassment because of living in a house made up of parents of the same sex . Just because it did not happen to your son , dose not mean that it dose not happen . And your experience is only a fraction of 1 % of the experiences that children go through because of having gay parents . It is impossible to say that it dose not happen . If it dose not happen to a few , then thats fine . But the majority suffers , and that far outweighs the few that do n't suffer because of having gay parents .
Because all guns are lethal in nature , all of them are capable of being used to kill someone if used improperly . Or are you now claiming that if Poplawski had been limited to bolt-action rifles , those police officers would still be alive because a bolt-action rifle is incapable of killing ?
Cute . And I can come up with about 5,000 to 7,000 examples that do have a bright orange muzzle .
Ok ... many many people have been killed in Africa because of the policies of the countries in the EU , South America , Asia , and so on ... .this hypocrisy annoys me .
Very many have : dolphins and whales , for example , and some cave-dwelling birds .
We got ta GET them law-abiders for having the audacity to believe the Constitution 's Bill of Rights ! Huh Brady !
Interesting . Where might one find this movie ? Waxy
Why are you dishonest enough to claim that you are n't trying to get YEC into the schools .
And here we have a leading YEC showing how he starts with his preexisting religious position and is not about to change it , no matter what the scientific evidences show .
Speaking of which , did you happen to see this image that someone kindly forwarded to me ? http : //iowntheworld.com/blog/wp-cont ... iew-lo-res.jpg
You are wrong in your claim . The power of the 14th amendment , applied to ensuring equality , has a very real history . Would you care to look at how the 14th amendment has been applied over its history ?
But poetry will never be taken seriously in political decisions . Atheists have a lot to like in songofgenesis , do n't they ? another quote

We call that a strawman , here . You have much to learn . Let me explain . A militia is a group of armed , ordinary citizens who gather . There are all these `` militias '' running around screaming that they 're a militia , but if my town was attacked for some reason , the citizens could just get some guns and gather on main street ... to form a militia ! Now do you understand ? If so , I expect you to ignore me . If not , then you 're hopeless . I ca n't get much clearer than that .
the blog is just the link for the article ... .geez , get a grip .
Why is it when Creo 's do n't believe something , Evo 's always think because they have studies or what have you that we Creo 's have to accept it as proof . I mean you do n't accept anything as proof from Creo 's . If Creo 's did some carbon testing and did it accurately and got some anomaly 's , you 'd still reject it . I did n't lie not even by ignorance . I just do n't believe it 's true , but I take it I 'm not allowed my beliefs . What fact has disproved my worldview , my worldview is intact as it ever has been ?
So what standards of proof do you hold the bible to ? What allows you to hold it next to other religious or fantastical texts and say `` Yes , this one is definately , without fail , the word of God , and this one is not . ''
and this :
Since I am constantly opposing you in favor of saving the lives of multiple millions of unborn babies to the abortionists vacuum each decade , It 's quite obvious that between the two of us , I 'm the only one who cares about unborn babies . You on the other hand offer lip service and lousy examples in order to make fallacious claims . The fact is that there is no practical reason for the problems in the OP you posted to exist at all with what is known about maternity and childbirth EVERYWHERE on Earth today . Even in impoverished countries like Tanzania where every doctor is aware of C-sections and the basics of prenatal care all that is required to avoid this problem is some common sense on their part .
No surprise there . You would have to invest some thought to define something . Why do n't you just consult your Little Golden Dictionary ?
What 's wrong with that ? Lots ! Rational thought alone keeps a person from doing just anything s/he wants . Should I , an atheist , kill another persons children just to see if that person will then hate me ? No , I shouldnt . Doing so would be grossly immoral . I guess God couldnt figure that one out for himself poor Job poor Jobs children . Theres also the simple fact that we moral humans recognize the difference between being treated fairly and unfairly , and we even feel empathy , both of which even chimps seem to do at at least a rudimentary level . So do you argue that chimps must already believe in God ? It does n't take religion to know of fairness or to be able to put oneself in another 's shoes and consider how that person would feel based on our actions .
Not really . Even Darwin recognized that it is populations that evolve , not individuals . Natural selection is differential reproductive success . I suspect that you are n't able to understand anything that Dawkins has said .
if the only choices we can possibly make are the one God approves , then we dont have free will , because we can not free choose the option that God does not approve of , which means we are forced to only choose the options that God approves of . this is not free will
And quote supposedly a former Justice who ignores the fact that one man = one vote . The NRA does n't get to vote and just like guns , people vote and people kill people sans guns . Death by any firearms is far down the list ! Attempting to move a fundamental right to the top of the list is ill advised and dangerous to a free people and the nation as a whole .
An attempt by you to dodge the main point .
because all children should have parents who want them dearly . btw , `` moral relativism '' is absurd . a phase people pass through as they discover diversity and is bewildered by it , thinking all are equally valid . it is a stance of both immature/superficial reasoning and moral depravity .
Certainly science has provided part of the answer with their finding of the Mitachondrial `` Eve '' , suggesting that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human populations . One of the standard rebuttals you hear is `` How did the Kangaroos get to Australia '' ? I do n't know if that 's covered in the Bible ... if God transported them or not .
So that 's the World Net Daily 's spin on it . The World Net Daily , known for its strong right wing bias and certainly not the most reputable source of information , claimed the report said that gun control is ineffective . In contrast , the National Academy of Science cautioned against drawing any conclusions about the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of gun control based on the report . E. William Colglazier , executive officer of the National Academy of Sciences and National Research Council , explained : `` Lott 's column gave the clear impression that the study was about gun control . It was not . The study was about the quality of the data and research on firearms injury and violence . These data and studies are frequently used by both sides in the debate on gun control . It was the committee 's task to make judgments about the quality of this scientific knowledge . The committee was not asked and does not offer any conclusions or comments on gun control policy . `` The column states that the panel ignored most of the studies that find a benefit in crime reduction from right-to-carry laws . The report contains an entire chapter and three appendixes that address the rather large literature on these laws . The report cites both studies that do find positive effects and studies that do not find positive effects . On the basis of the very mixed evidence , the panel concluded that there was no basis for a conclusion that the passage of right-to-carry laws either increases or decreases crime ... . '' Deltoid : NAS responds to Lott ? s attack So there is no basis for claiming that the presence of law abiding people with concealed weapons would have stopped this tragedy in Germany .
I 'll let you know to what extent the movie documents it . I 'm off to see it in a few .
Yes I know , a lot of people have done a lot of work to try to refute Behes work . From your link ;
If he lies about being pro-life , what else will he be willing to lie about in order to be elected ? That is a legitimate , not-made-up issue that is relevant to elections .
But people start threads here all the time against Christianity regardless of whether someone claims something here about it or not . It 's prejudice , pure and simple , and you 're no exception . Now , one would think , being the supposedly non-Christian enlightened person you are , you would simply say `` oh , I did n't realize that my posts came across as anti-Christian sometimes , and that it indicates a prejudice on my part , and will try to not have prejudices in my thinking . '' I mean , one would think those of you are do this sort of thing would be happy that someone had pointed out the obvious prejudice going on , as it would be a case to help you move away from prejudicial thinking .
You 're quoting another RELIGIOUS article , pretending to speak on the issue of science . You do n't ask your car mechanic for advice on changing the CPU on your computer . And you DO NOT turn to pastors for SCIENTIFIC advice on gay genetics .
The question still remains as to whether this is negative intrusion ( which is what the libertarians want ) or positive intrusion ( what the libertarians do not want . ) Anyone with half a brain can know that it 's intrusion . The matter becomes complicated when one tries to place it in the category of anti-murder laws or theocratic forced religion laws .
Just like when you have an abortion , it cleans out your uterous so you can have another baby if you wish .
Honestly I 'm not sure if it was ever said in the Bible , but I sure have heard a lot of the Bible thumpers saying free will is a gift from God .

Look at the 2 side by side . They are as different as night and day . No creature can live without breathing for millions of years except in fairy tales .
So you 're saying that the theory of evolution is similar to # # # # , in that they both make large messes when they come into contact with fans ?
Well the 'brain slip ' seems to be permanent and deeply embedded . I have been waiting for someone to call the three million population statistic and point out the Republic has over 300 million inhabitants not counting illegal aliens and terrorist not known . Actually the `` gun crazies '' you mention are comprised of folks who harbor the same sentiments you do You fail to see the right to KBA about to be recognized in Heller and applied through the States by incorporation in McDonald . Being Constitutional will mean you will have to change or to move . Be aware that the Nations who ban guns for the common people are the ones making the news about mass shootings and cartel murders . You fail to note that governments killed far more of it 's citizens in the last century than all the wars combined . Picking out anacronisms to garner support for whatever cause you support is so weak it is not a blip on the radar screen and could be easily solved by adherence to the Constitution . Just like you overlook the population to find a few abberations , you mistake the act and suggest this man was a law abiding citizen and an NRA member . Evidently your interest lagged and you did n't read his pedigree nor his past criminal history . A 'gun crazy ' misses all of that in their haste to point fingers meanwhile overlooking the myriad of gun laws studied by CDC and the NAS found no benefit of any of them but here you are beating the drum calling for more of the same innefective nonsense and avoiding your responsibility to protect yourself , family and property and a third person as well . You completely shun the fact that the police have NO DUTY to protect you nor anyone else . Now that is not only 'gun crazy ' but pure , unadultrated loon behavior . You might ought to read Gun Crazy BY Jacob Sulman I believe ? You have all the tics of being a mental case who has n't been certified yet .
'IF ' is the question . It suggests that Holy Tradition does not know the answer . Secondly , the issue of the flood itself could still be true and tested scientifically ... as to whether an historical Noah existed that you might consign to 'myth ' . Does anyone here not find it interesting that there is almost a universal factor in societies concerning a global flood ? PS I have already discussed M-Eve on another post .
Say what ? You can not say for certain that anything would have happened . For all we know if the kids in the classroom had guns they could very well have started shooting and then how do the other students know which one is the real threat ? After all , all of them are shooting fellow students , right ? So how do they know who the shooter is if EVERYONE is shooting ? Who knows what kind of massive gun fight such a thing could turn into . I support gun rights as much as the next person . But having them in a school environment is just plain ridiculous .
This must be why you 're determined to raise science onto a pedestal , so you can believe that it 's answers are above us , giving us guidance from above - simply replacing the role of God/church with science .
You do have a problem with this person defending himself or you would not be attacking him . Fear made him do this . The fear was created in him by the buglers . You want unarmed passengers to attack armed terrorists on airplanes , but you have a problem with a home owner killing buglers .
Yea that was uncle John !
So now you are saying that the earth does n't move ? I get it . The earth used to be fixed at the center of the universe when those Bible verses were written but God changed it . Now it orbits the sun like the other planets . Actually , the verse does say that grasshoppers have four legs . There is no mention of jumping legs . You supplied that because it is foolish to claim otherwise . That 's what I mean when I say that you reject parts of the Bible that you see as foolish . When you have accepted the evidence that the Bible is in error ( 4 legs on a grasshopper , sun at center of solar system , rabbits chewing cud , an unmoving earth ) you add elements that are n't in the Bible and declare it without error . You `` interpret '' and then claim that you are reading it literally . Pick one and go with it . You seem to claim that you accept the Bible literally and then add whatever you feel is necessary to make it rational .
We agree ! Excellent !
Interesting . Give me an example .
You only say that it wo n't make a change because you support the effects it will have .
well that wo n't help you when you go to hell ... Woo hoo
Because self-defence , unlike most other 'reasons ' , automatically allows all citizens firearm access , and in most cases allows firearm acess without mandatory training/evaluation . When this occurs , you are much more likely to get misuse of firearms . If you read around you 'll see that I consider all rights as needing justification . This comes both from my stance as a relativist and as a UK citizen , where there is no formalised Constitution . Ask yourself this - if a right can not be justified , why should it be treated as a 'right ' ?
And the loss to society because people used guns instead of an alternate weapon is ?
First of all , it 's not pro evo , it 's pro evidence . But I guess that is kinda the same , as all the evidence points to evolution . Second , evolution 's not a lie , it is supported by the evidence . Third evolution says nothing about god . But alright , I 'll make you a compromise , refute the list on this forum then . But remember , please use evidence in this refuting , not mere assertions .
No one here is talking about babies The fact that you would incorrectly call a ZEF a 'baby ' only proves that anti-choicers think that women are invisible .
i dont believe you
Will the Obama administration come for your guns ?
I had researched some stuff about viruses that was applicable about life in general because it is the only thing that is not defintely classified . So the argument was about life , the other stuff was just peripheral . Do n't make such a big deal about including other tings in it .
Let 's give credit where credit is due . Science taught that the world was the centre of the universe . The leading scientists convinced churchmen to take allegorical passages of the Bible and re-interpret them as literal . The ancient Greeks , who were esteemed in Europe as the pre-eminent scientists of their day believed this . They also believed that people were made up of four elements . And taught this . Scientists backed up racism `` No rational man ( writes Thomas Huxley , a contemporary evolutionist ) , cognizant of the facts , believes that the average Negro is the equal , still less the superior , of the white man . And if this be true , it is simply incredible that , when all his disabilities are removed , and our prognathous relative has a fair field and no favor , as well as no oppressor , he will be able to compete successfully with his bigger-brained and smaller-jawed rival , in a contest which is to be carried out on by thoughts and not by bites . '' ( Thomas H. Huxley , `` Lay Sermans , Addresses and Reviews '' ( New York : Appleton , 1871 ) p. 20 . Huxley was arguing that blacks could not compete intellectually with Caucasians , even under equal and fair conditions . ) '' http : //www.goodschools.com/darwin.htm What then is your point ?
Actually , even though you 're made fun of here , your question is quite legitimate . Do n't let the jabs slow you down . It 's precisely because they do n't have an answer to your question , that they make fun of it . It 's a debating tactic . We have nothing in our experience that shows that a `` singularity '' is possible , let alone plausible , but we are told to accept it as a reasonable explanation for the origin of the universe . You can accept it or not , but if you do , you 'll be accepting it on a premise that has no more strength behind it than saying `` because I said so '' . The question then becomes , `` What is the most reasonable explanation , chance or a creator God ? '' The fact is that the singularity theory militates against other accepted theoies of science such as the notion of cause and effect . This is common with evolutionary theory . It has no problem stepping out of the accepted norms of science and crucifying any idea that stands in its way , no matter how vaild that idea may be . After all , evolutionary theory must survive at all costs . It reminds me of the Dark Ages , when the Churuch ruled , only this time the high priests are the `` scientists '' .
No . You 're missing the point . Al wants you to think all we have to do is stop emitting CO2 . He wants you to fear something that he knows how to fix ... so you 'll give him prizes for being a genius and solving the problem . Al Gore is a shyster ... just like Michael Moore . Documentary , my XXX ! Tell me , what has caused the global warming on Mars ? ... Jupiter ? I understand the temperatures there have been rising more in the past few years than before . Think it could be resulting from their industrial age ? ... and he 's pretty much a hypocrit about what we should do . Check the stats on his personal home . Check the emissions rating of his antique private jet . He claims to be doing his part by leading a carbon neutral life ... which means he merely paid for permission to continue polluting the earth with his inefficient means of private transportation and his energy sucking home . He claims that sea levels will rise 20 feet or so shortly , yet he bought a million dollar condo near sea level in California . We should all decrease what we spew into the air ( and what we send to landfills ) . This fact does not diminish the lies told by Al Gore ... the ones that got him an Oscar and a Nobel Peace Prize , both of which become more meaningless each year . Gore , a shyster http : //newsbusters.org/blogs/noel-sh ... d-return-oscar http : //www.globalwarminghoax.com/news.php ? extend.29 1 . The film claims that melting snows on Mount Kilimanjaro evidence global warming . The Governments expert was forced to concede that this is not correct . 2 . The film suggests that evidence from ice cores proves that rising CO2 causes temperature increases over 650,000 years . The Court found that the film was misleading : over that period the rises in CO2 lagged behind the temperature rises by 800-2000 years . 3 . The film uses emotive images of Hurricane Katrina and suggests that this has been caused by global warming . The Governments expert had to accept that it was not possible to attribute one-off events to global warming . 4 . The film shows the drying up of Lake Chad and claims that this was caused by global warming . The Governments expert had to accept that this was not the case . 5 . The film claims that a study showed that polar bears had drowned due to disappearing arctic ice . It turned out that Mr. Gore had misread the study : in fact four polar bears drowned and this was because of a particularly violent storm . 6 . The film threatens that global warming could stop the Gulf Stream throwing Europe into an ice age : the Claimants evidence was that this was a scientific impossibility . 7 . The film blames global warming for species losses including coral reef bleaching . The Government could not find any evidence to support this claim . 8 . The film suggests that the Greenland ice covering could melt causing sea levels to rise dangerously . The evidence is that Greenland will not melt for millennia . 9 . The film suggests that the Antarctic ice covering is melting , the evidence was that it is in fact increasing . 10 . The film suggests that sea levels could rise by 7m causing the displacement of millions of people . In fact the evidence is that sea levels are expected to rise by about 40cm over the next hundred years and that there is no such threat of massive migration . 11 . The film claims that rising sea levels has caused the evacuation of certain Pacific islands to New Zealand . The Government are unable to substantiate this and the Court observed that this appears to be a false claim . Stay tuned as the UK High Court 's final ruling may impose additional restrictions on teaching An Inconvenient Truth in classes . They may also point out additional inaccuracies as we all know they only scratched the surface above . http : //www.globalwarminghoax.com/news.php ? extend.24 http : //www.prisonplanet.com/articles ... polarbears.htm http : //www.capmag.com/article.asp ?

You have not proven any lies ... .Sorry , you have not . The studies were done in different countries . AND , since the APA is now also reporting the lack of genetic evidence , obviously there are no lies involved . ARe you aware that in May of this year , ( you should catch up ) the APA has begun changing the language in their papers , related to therapies , causes of homosexuality ? These are professionals , belonging to the APA , including their former presidents and leaders ... Sorry but you are wrong , the paper includes studies from different countries on twins , the facts are it is an `` environmental '' cause not a genetic cause ... ... that is what the studies are showing and even the APA is beginning to change it their writing suggesting reparative therapies will work , depending on the cause ... See this : APA 's New Pamphlet on Homosexuality De-emphasizes the Biological Argument , Supports a Client 's Right to Self-Determination
think about what you just typed , that does n't make any sense .
If she was only facing a 'bungler ' , then what did she have to worry about . Sorry , could n't resist .
To clarify : is it the womans choice whether the guy is prosecuted after he has been named , or is it the states ? By what you 've said so far , it seems that all this law does is give woman the power to punish men if they get pregnant by them ; despite the fact that the woman was just as consenting as the man at the time of the coitus . There are also contraceptive paths for women that do n't involve condoms . If a woman gets pregnant because she forgot to take the pill that morning and always relied on that rather than on condoms to stop her getting pregnant , why should the man be punished ? The message here should be simple . If you do n't want an abortion , and are n't currently in a position where you can support your children , do n't have unprotected sex . At the moment , it is the woman 's choice alone whether she has an abortion or not , so it is the woman who has to look after the child if she is single after its birth . If you want to add men to that equation , you have to add them in both places - give them the legal right to 'have an abortion ' ( force their partner to have one ) , and make them legally responsible for the child if they do not do so . Then you have an entirely connected couple from coitus onwards ; both consenting to sex , both choosing not to have an abortion and both caring for the child after birth . I doubt that that law would be a popular one , either - but if you are going to force a man to take equal legal responsibility for a child , you have to give them equal legal opportunity to avoid it .
I know , but it is you that got it wrong : Quote :
of course .
That is what it said . Now your website gives a false translation to this . It clearly is talking about if the unborn is harmed . Not to mention the numerous other quotes I gave you about how a person ( in the Christian faith ) is formed before conception ! This shows that God has already created you . God also talks about how you ca n't kill a person he created . This is an easy concept to follow . I suggest if you wish to learn what the Bible says you read it and not take what a biased website has to say . Religioustolerance.org is a joke that misleads people into making God what they want him to be .
Yes , the Byzantines are a Catholic Rite . The Catholic Church is divided into rites- there are seven I believe , the Roman , of course , being the largest . The Byzantine Catholics are an Eastern Catholic Rite , and as you said are almost identicle to the Orthodox Churches except that they acknowledge the Pope as the head of the Church . East to West , a website regarding all the churches of the Catholic Church , especially those of the east . Real quick , the Orthodox acknowledge the Pope as the successor of Peter , but not as the head of the Church . Am I correct ?
You are a foreigner yourself I recall you admitting . What do you lable that ?

That is the way military people abbreviate their designation of rank . Leo 's , not military use seargent . They call people 'civilians ' . When they get paid by the DOD and have to abide by the Geneva Convention then they can , until then who are you to be arbiter of all things , grey or black ?
Since when does the fate get decided by the victim ? A woman could be said to have a biased opinion on it because she is an involved party . Even so , I take the stand that no one has any authority over the other to make that decision .
So your saying I have no right to disagree unless I can prove and refute evolution and science . Right , you can come back down to earth now . I can disagree with what I want to and no one an explanation , however that was n't my intent . [ quote ] You have the right to defend yourself , but when you resort to comments such as `` get a life '' to socialist , we start ( or merely confirm our existing notions ) that you no idea what you are talking about when you disagree with science and evolution . [ quote/ ] Oh you mean this comment from Socialist , `` I am not considering your points anymore , so In a way I am . I just like making fun of them . It 's entertaining '' . It 's funny how you forgot to include his comment . What scientific answer would you have me give ?
Do me a favor . Write , in your own words , two paragraphs . One explaining the electromagnetic spectrum ( and the visible spectrum 's place in it ) , and one discussing rods and cones in the eyes .
They only need 1/4 of the legislature , so they 'll probably get that . But if it actually gets to the polls ? The conservatives took a big hit when they ran around screaming `` If gays get married society will collapse and we 'll all be doomed ! ! ! 11 ! 1 ! ! '' and then nothing happened . And of course the most organized group in Mass . opposing gay marriage is the Mass . Catholic church , and people are n't going to take kindly to a bunch of child rapers telling them what 's right and wrong . The anti-gay side really does n't have much to work with ; it 'll largely be a contest of good will and common sense vs. scare tactics , and the scare tactics have already been proven wrong .
Who 's this directed at ? Me or Ray ?
How strange . It seems that Habbit 's definition of the word definition is meaningless . Physicists and chemists can define what they mean by the word `` carbon , '' but according to Habbit that is just their opinion . According to Habbit , carbon can be a chocolate candy meant to be eaten in a car . That may be his opinion and he considers it as valid as specific definitions assigned to words used by experts in any given field .
The question is illogical . By declaring the existence of an all powerful God then saying God can not do something is not a comment on his powerfulness but rather the direct representation of his nature . Your question by its very statement does not test wether or not God is all powerful but wether or not God is comprehensible . See another thread for that topic . The statement that God is all powerful defines his nature . To state then that he can not do something outside of his nature as proof of the non existence of his nature is circular in logic .
But it has never been claimed that everything developet simultaneously . Probably not . So back to the original question that you ducked with ad hoc arguments . What is Archaeopteryx . If it is a bird , why does it have a tail , grastalia , teeth , pre-orbital fenestra , and on and on . If it is n't a bird then why does it have feathers , opposable hallux , pneumatic bones , a furcula , and even a small carina in one specimen ? How can creationism explain Archaeopteryx ? http : //home.houston.rr.com/bybayouu/ ... graphica_1.jpg

So , in summation , your position is that the US should be more like the Europeans ? Should we also bathe less frequently ? Have poor dental hygeine ? Become an `` also ran '' economy ? No thanks . I have no desire to mimic Europe .
But in terms of legality and constitutionality , do you believe that they should still be prohibited ? Also , how can god hate ? I thought he was true love . Scratch that -- I thought he was unknowable . Thanks
Actually , I believe that there IS not entity that is supernatural , and therefore do not have to define it any further than that . It is the believer that has to define it futher , .. which often they do n't .
You jsut do n't get it . You act like two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for lunch . You as a hetero get to go and get married to the person of your choice but I do not . What part of that do you not understand . You say this is n't personal and for you this is true but for me the man I love is nothing but a stranger to me in the eyes of the law . How cruel can you be
If the justification for morality is obedience to a divine authority , it has no place in a public school . Those without religious beliefs are not by definition immoral .
In case you were wondering , no one here has missed the fact that you 're trying to divert attention from the real issues by beating one minor issue into the ground .
So you disapprove of what these gun owners are doing ? It 's encouraging to see someone on the progun side who can think for themselves and recognize when other people on their side are doing wrong .
So what are you trying to do here - smother everyone with bafflegab ?
If that 's truly what the organization says , then it 's a hypocrite of an organization .
Your claim is not supported in the least . If we look to the landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade , we find that it was not women seeking abortions that were punished , but the people who procured the abortion that were . It would be the same if abortion were again made illegal . To prove this , we need only to look at a recent abortion regulatory statute : the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act . Needless to say , there are far less doctors who perform abortions than there are women who seek them , and because it was not a problem executing abortion law prior to 1973 , it likewise wo n't be a problem executing abortion law should abortion be made illegal again .
Is n't agreeing with what ? The senate has n't passed any laws that would restrict right to carry anymore than it already is .
so what about jesus ' life is credible if the source is unreliable ? was it that jesus didnt walk on water but he fed 5000 with 5 loaves ? was it that he didnt forgive the samaritan harlot but he raised lazarus from the dead ? what did the authors get right ? i mean , i can easily believe jesus said he came to bring a sword and not peace . but you dont . so how do we possibly pattern our lives according to how jesus lived if we dont know whether what they recorded was actually what he did ? it is necessary to believe that the gospels are true , otherwise you can not follow a pattrn you dont have .
It is unclear how this 'natural argument fits in with the concept of rights . We have a right to defend ourselves against maniacs even if it is natural for them with their mental condition to want to kill us .
I think the currently popular belief is that time itself is limited . Space , time , energy , matter and laws all came into existence together . Of course that 's impossible for us to envisage ... .
You 're going to have to do a better job of explaining why . Mostly you talk gibberish .
Not many women would say they had an abortion now , let alone back when it was illegal . It is an emotionally trying event . I can understand why she would n't for that reason alone . Another possibility is that the Administration is buying her silence , or it could be a combination of the two .
What else can you expect from a leftist media . It would go against the agenda to show any thing else . After every liberal knows a firearm owner is a bumbling red neck , racist , sexist drooling dim wit .
Just as you are uninformed on the other subject ? I honestly believe that is the only reason you do n't at least partially accept evolution .

Gee , gives the impression that Dr. David M. Raup , Curator of Geology , Museum of Natural History , Chicago , puts little stock in the fossil record and rejects evolution , helping support the preceding assertion that surely ones belief in evolution based on paleontology can scarcely be considered scientific . But thats not at all what Dr. Raup was stating . While Googling for a fuller quote , I ran across a page that showed how this  and many other  statements by Dr. Raup were distorted by Creationists . To start with , here is a fuller quote :
Is there a defined number of posts he could make in the other threads so that you would consider them `` finished '' ?
Hey , thanks for the quote ! Am I published now ?
Right . It was thrown out of schools back in the 1960s , and again in the 1980s when attempts were made to dress creationism up in the jargon of science and call it `` Creation science . ''
Uh ... What ? This sort of response could only be dreamed up by a religious zealot looking for a reason to oppose atheism . No atheist would ever respond with `` I 'm the God of my own universe . '' Further , the idea that `` you have to have standards to these things or being an atheist is irrational '' makes no sense . That sentence does n't even mean anything at all . Unless this conversation was intended to show two people repeating nonsense to one another , it is useless .
Well you never know cause your pro life and for the death penalty .
I 'm not sure that your comment will encourage any sort of discussion . Certainly no one is glad because your mother died so young . Not even creationists are likely to be gleeful .
So what does this have to do with the topic ? Alcohol is legal , marijuana is n't , but they both serve the same purpose ( getting high ) , so why should one be illegal and the other not ?
Wrong . It was Soviet women . The USSR no longer exists . Unless you believe that those godless commies are just playing possum ?
Do n't even think about contriving how gay marrige violates YOUR RIGHTS assmonkey . That 's the most ludicrous , inane statement I have yet heard from the Religious Right .
Not necessarily . When `` life '' begins is irrelevant , because flowers and weeds do n't have rights yet they are a life form . The thing that determines rights is intelligence . Not how much or how little , but whether someone has it at all . A spec of dirt has no intelligence . It wo n't pop up and say `` hey ! How ya doin ! '' unless you 're on crack . We 've actually killed intelligent entities for less than the consequences of carrying out an unwanted pregnancy . We hunt , and we go to war . Even though I do not agree with war , I do agree with hunting , and I myself hunt on occasion . However , that is off topic . The point is , carrying out an unwanted pregnancy can have devastating effects , and those next 18 years could hold her back from her life . Its awful how she will have to liver her life . If she gets an abortion , the embryo does not ( to quote another opinion ) `` mentally exist '' . Now , hunting is really only done for recreation , and maybe a good meal . They would 've been almost just as well off if they went to the local taco bell . Sure , they 'd prefer hunting , but its really only done for fun and exercise . I , myself , value an animal over an embryo at its current stage . The only reason I do n't completely think an animal is worth more is because that embryo has a chance of becoming a human . Then again , the animal does mentally exist and has full awareness , and the embryo is really just a sitting cellular watersack with no organs .
That 's because these questions were never , ever , EVER raised in the original Parker case . None of the six DC people who took the city to court possessed a felony record , they did n't bring up anything other than the fact that DC made it impossible for them to legally buy and own a handgun . That 's all the court addressed . If they addressed anything else in the Heller case it would 've been judicial activism , legislating from the bench .
Are we talking about the same Obama here ? The same one , who 's head of the DHS , told law enforcement to be on the lookout for anyone who disagreed with the government ?
If everytime I say something you ( you in the general sense ) bring out `` that is oppressive to women '' then please do n't bother posting . If you do n't believe in it you do n't ... I guess you could say if you do n't support drugs you are oppressing the drug users ... .but you really arent .
Again , this was n't just about you and me . I do think you corrected someone 's spelling and if you did n't it was another creationist .
Right . And that is the reason for peer review . Creationists do n't subject their ramblings to peer review . That is why so much care is devoted to the proper construction of experiments to test the hypotheses by real scientists . Creationists just invent ad hoc stories without any experimentation .
But do n't you see ? They are n't sure . They do n't know . They did n't `` prove '' anything ! !
Actually , I 've been posting more than ever ... just not here . This place has become gay central and it bored me . I posted the above because I knew it was a topic near and dear to both of our hearts .
They are safer . The 300 gun deaths per year rate has dropped since then . Let 's have a little reality intrude on the gun porn fantasies . Only 13 % of Swiss homes ever had an Army-issue weapon in them , Militia service extending only from age 20 to age 30 , and the ammunition was stored in a sealed pack , with severe punishments for the seal being broken .
So producing a child is the defining characteristic of a marriage ? What about love , trust , respect , companionship ? My wife and I may decide to not have a child , does that mean our marriage should be made illegal ? Again , you keep posting nambla this and nambla that . Nambla is a group of deviant pedophiles , homosexuals despise this behavior too . GROW UP DHARD ... I mean DMG2FUN .
Because this question is irrelevant .
Believe in what ? If it helps - God 's love surpasses all logic . I have complete proof that God exists . From that point onward there is no need to argue with things that are deemed as logical . To me there 's more to life than the logical things .
So you 're saying your unwilling to discuss it , and you think that an oblique ad hominem ( fitting in with nut cases ) is a way to progress this topic ?
Actually , that story was an invention after the fact . It never happened . At least that is what the witnesses who were there said . Why do christians feel that it is OK to invent such stories to support their point ? Is n't that lying ? Is n't lying wrong ?
well , I thought Another Opinion covered my belief fairly well so why bother ? There is always the option not to respond to me .
I will let Peeling address this . But seriously , do you truly believe that scientists are this great cabal whose ultimate purpose is to steer the political process in a more liberal direction ? To what end ? Are conservatives more unwilling to fund science , is that your point ?
Wrong again sherlock . All of this animosity is after the fact to why radical islam considers our christian Nation to be hypocritical due to the exporting of our pop culture of hedonistic sexual and moral depravity . That was why they signed fatwas against us originally . It is the abortions , gay marriage and our women walking around half naked that caused that lack of respect to occur . And you can thank the immoral left for that contribution to Americas image . It was the Left that coined the phrase , `` If it feels good , do it , '' Not the Right .
you know why ? because God touches our hearts like nothing you have ever felt before . it is amazing
Just a guess on my part . But it 's probably one of the only factors that separates our advanced industrialized nation -- as the only one still having the death penalty -- from savage places like Afghanistan , etc . Having a doctor allows the self-deceptive veneer that a most uncivilized , inhumane act , about to take place , is somehow civilized or humane . And not the bloodthirsty , venomous , purely vengeful thing that it is . He sounds like a very principled individual to me . With this , yet one more indication that the death penalty system in our country is unsustainable . Not only for moral reasons , but because it is not shown to serve as an effective deterrent , and because the overwhelmed system is not supportable , under our American Constitution , often punishing everyone involved , even the families of victims . ( i.e . These cases go on for years and years and years and years . There 's no closure for people . )
Actually quite incorrect . One of the signs that evolution by means of natural selection is occurring is when changes in genetic makeup takes place in randomly mating populations . It seems that you have been influenced by Hitler and his breeding programs .
A species is a group of animals that are closely related . Zygotes are not a group of animals that are closely related , but they are part of a species .
Well since posting on this thread has died and this seems to me to be the most interesting atheistic theory , I want to get a bit of clarification . First , what do you mean by being allowed to cease providing for it at any age , but never allowed to kill it ? By this do you mean that to cease providing for during the first trimester is not killing it ? Is that because it is not alive at that time ? If I follow you ( and I 'm not sure I do ) should the mother be allowed to have the baby removed at some point during the third trimester , after which it must be kept alive ( and perhaps put up for adoption ) ?
Well to answer the first question ... not all evidence has been erased . In fact there is quite a bit of evidence for the flood . How do you explain remains of crabs and other sea creatures found in the same area inland as dinousaurs and other land dwelling creatures . The Grand Canyon is also evidence for the flood . A canyon of the same type was formed when Mt . St. Helens erupted when the snow and ice melted at the top and rushed down the slope . Even evolutionists have admitted that it looks just like the Grand Canyon , only on a smaller scale , and that it appears to have been created over millions of years but in fact it only took a couple of hours . For you to say that there isnt any evidence is a very ignorant thing because there is just as much evidence or more supporting the flood as there are people and things that dont support it . To answer the second question ... not all bones are fossilized . Bones do decompose . Also perhaps people just havent been looking in the right places . No one knows for sure where the arks true resting place is let alone the paths the animals took going away from the ark so there is no way anyone could start looking for bones even if they did exist . It is possible that they havent been just stumbled upon if they are still around to be stumbled upon . Even if i am wrong in what i have stated in my answers there isnt anything that can back up completely what you have implied in your questions .
Bingo . Old fossils can be corrupted ( contaminated , to be precise ) by contacting anything from human skin to pollen in the air . This would add a relatively large amount of carbon to the fossil and would indicate that the fossil is recent . It 's not hard to imagine this happening in the hands of inexperienced scientists ... *cough* Creationists *cough*
Well , there you go . The fact he , in his reverse analogy , portrays mere disagreement in many cases as telling `` posters there how disgusting and sinful they are and how their rights should be denied '' only makes my point . No once do I recall seeing anyone here saying that he or anyone else was `` disgusting , '' and `` sinful . '' Apparently he 's not too familiar with the concept of ad hominem either .
Source ?
Well ... that does tend to happen when you waste time arguing the obvious as if it were a rebuttal to anything . Maybe rather than being argumentative to the point of arguing over things that are pointless and that no one disagrees on , you could thoughtfully discuss things that people do n't see eye to eye on . You might get better results from people that way .

So ... all Christians have some sort of brain damage , trebor ? You 're not getting any better at this are you ?
But it took a lot longer to develop . My point was that only after about 5000 years of human civilization did empiricism as science develop . Religion , supernaturalism , and mythology trace back into prehistory . What we know as science did n't even begin to exist until the late 1500s and 1600s . Before that it was OK to do science like Aristotle did - no experiment , only thinking about a logical answer . Thus , heavy objects fell faster than light ones and any fool could tell that the sun orbited the earth . But science is more than an inner way of thinking . It is a process and a method for learning about the universe . It is called methodological naturalism . That is not to say the science asserts that nothing exists except what is natural . It says that science ca n't study the supernatural .
** Not true . I most certainly do apply EAM to all empirical observations of biological originality , just to see if it still applies . To date , it always has . As for darwinian interpretations of that same evidence , presenting them and defending them is your responsibility , not mine .
It is worse then that they just do n't get it . Once you put some civil rights on the ballot nothing is off limits . Freedom of speech , religion , assembly ect.. they are all up to be voted out of existence for an unpopular minority by the majority . They just do n't get it .
Now as I have asked you perfectly legitimate questions , without any attacks on your personal self , and I have asked you to support your assertions , will you return and defend your beliefs and claims ? And obviously troll = anyone who disagrees with Marc9000 . Just as atheist and liberal are defined in your dictionary .
You believe two things that are incorrect : that you have refuted evolutionary theory , and that we will now accept intellegent design because of your attempt .
all you have to do is scroll back a page or two in this forum ... look for my posts regarding cichlids , guppies and lizards . I also gave you snails . show me any example of so-called natural selection or evolution in the field and I bet I can shoot it down .
So does the 2 day before birth unborn child because it is in the third trimester . I as in what you have come to know as ME was born somewhere in the third trimester . The body that I 'm sitting in this chair with and typing this with was born at conception , and started as a sperm before conception .
And just specifically what parts are those ? Mr. Bennett seems to think he is above the law , Canadian or otherwise . I quote from Page 3 of my US Passport :
So what ? If somebody wants to die then they 'll kill themselves no matter what .
Well I # # # # , moan , and bitch about it to and I know I ca n't prove anything , but do'nt logic say an AK47 ASSAULT RIFLE not semi auto but the real deal is going to cost hundreds less south of their border , Know doubt the same for an M16.Also you do n't have to worry about smuggling them in as much if at all.Besides it getting harder all the time to get your ASSAULT RIFLES ( you know the full auto type ) not to mention hand grenades and rpgs at your corner gun shop anymore.Oh yeah less not forget the gun shows , and all there loop holes . Jus a thought .
But you do n't think that it is circuitous to say that this other power did n't have a beginning ?
OH ? What U.S. Code governs that ? What does it say ?
And if people have a `` religious belief '' whereby they do n't think blacks should vote , or that interracial marriage should occur , should governmental officials who have those `` religious beliefs '' just be allowed to ignore their duty ? What if I had a religious belief that prevented me from performing my governmental tasks for Christians ? Should that be respected as well ? They are paid to do their job . People who get to pick and choose what their `` job '' should entail because of their religious beliefs should find another form of work . If when I was in the military , I had suddenly stood up and said , `` Woah ! Hey ! I joined the military but it is against my religious beliefs to hurt others , and this plan of action will hurt other people . '' Should that be respected and I keep my `` job '' ?
No . I am a student and I personally do n't have much money . So how could I help them ? I have very limited money of my own . I help when I can , but sometimes with my present finances I ca n't do much . If I had enough money , as I assume you do , than yes I would help them as much as I could . This is just an example of where people feel compassion . And as I have said before , Dawkin 's has trouble explaining how the universal feelings could come about through evolution . We would not expect mutated pondscum to produce feelings and morals , ethics , etc .
No thanks ! I 'd rather not . My link above disclaims anything they have to say .
Thanks . But it seems that you do n't understand . Perhaps the people of Austin are more intelligent than they are down here in Houston . Maybe it 's just that you are surrounded by educated people who show a tendency away from creationism . But you see , I run into people all the time ( and meet them on this board too ) who think that speciation has never been observed . Why do they think that ? Because their holy book tells them so . The herring gull/lesser black-backed gull is an example of a single , vast , globe encircling population that has become separate species at the extremes of it 's range - and those extremes overlap . Before I came to Texas the idea that the Book of Genesis was literally true never occurred to me . So it was kind of a neat moment to realize that the big birds around the restaurant dumpster were herring gulls , a living example of a population in the process of forming separate species .
He had ALREADY MADE the animals . `` now the Lord God HAD FORMED ... '' not `` now the Lord God formed ... '' See the difference ? He already HAD FORMED the animals before he brought them to Adam . He made the animals before Adam .
Your opinion . Okay .
logic would lead one to believe abortion is wrong ... but why be consistent in your thinking . The point is , logic and rational thinking is not a requirement to make a law . You can ban abortion is you want ... the states did it and the constitution allows it , even if 5 legislatures think otherwise .
So what you are saying is that even though you claimed to have studied evolution , you have not . I understand . In fact , my religion is not evolution . I even hold my religion in higher regard than to consider using it as an insult . Since you think that calling science a religion is an insult , your religion must be trivial and largely meaningless . But that aside , since you want to lump all of science into the word `` evolution '' so that you can reject it all at once , I 'm just going to use the word science . sarablaze is n't a scientist and , like you , has probably had very little scientific education . But I 'm going to try to explain to you again . A religion is held by faith . That means that it is not supported by actual evidence . On the other hand , science is not accepted by faith since it is built on a process of questioning and testing everything . There is nothing in science that I `` believe '' . Do I believe that the earth orbits the sun ? No . But when presented with the observations of the relative positions of the sun and planets , the most parsimonious explanation is that it is so . I accept that and will accept that until someone can present more evidence and a better explanation . That is true of all science . I do n't believe any of it but accept the explanations that have been tested that account for the observations . In science , by the way , the facts are the observations - not the theories . So the facts of gravity are the observations of things falling to earth and observations of the relative positions of the planets . The current theory of gravity only imperfectly explains those facts - it is part of the general theory of relativity developed by Einstein . In biology , the facts are that we observe living things to change over time . We even have facts from many different fields ( biogeography , genetics , molecular biology , population genetics , morphology , embryology , paleontology , and others ) that point to the fact that living things change over time . The explanations of the mechanics of those changes form the theory of evolution .
I think you are the same person as usa all the way and again.. you have no right to talk about murder because you murder the english language everytime you post . And no.. the baby does not belong to god because there is no baby and I do n't know if there is a god or not . Btw.. I 'm not going to incubate something in my body because of you think it 's wrong because someone who may or may not exist said so .
Actually , there is no such thing as `` an evolutionary mutation of a gene . '' A mutation is a mutation . For evolution to have occurred requires neither that a mutation be new nor useful and they do n't require new structures nor structures . Here 's a little mental exercise for you . At most , a person can have only two alleles for any gene . This would have been the condition of the human race 6,000 years ago according to creationists . It would not have been possible for there to be more than 2 alleles for any given gene . Now consider that for every gene in the human genome there is an average of 14 different alleles , sometimes more , sometimes less . Where did all of those alleles come from ?
** Nor do I think you at all stupid . I do not debate stupid people , there is no challenge in it . Nor do I debate arrant foolishness and irrational notions such as biblical literalism . It 's no more challenging than shooting fish in a barrel , and no more satisfying than destroying a child 's faith in the tooth fairy . But I do take offence at you characterizing my ability to reason logically and to think with some originality as being nothing more than 'manipulation ' and sophistry .
And many of the questions that creationists ask .
I 'm not . -- -
I think you have already answered your own question .
So every woman who has an abortion lives an irresponsible life . Care to give any examples , or are you just spouting rubbish with no experience or knowledge whatsoever ?
Well , the short version is that shortly after the big bang , the universe was filled by a hot quark plasma . As it expanded and cooled , the process of nucleosynthesis produced the primordial elemental abundance , primarily hydrogen , with some deutirium , helium , and lithium . The physics is well understood , and verified by observation . Quantifying uncertainties in primordial nucleosynthesis without Monte Carlo simulations At roughly a billion years of age , stars and galaxies formed , some fraction of the stars that formed were massive supergiants , that burned up their hydrogen into other elements , up to the atomic number of iron . This occurred at a tremendous rate and in a few more billion years , these stars went supernova and exploded . Prior to going supernova , these stars go through a phase where the outer layers of the star are shed , providing ways to transport the lighter elements away from the star . You can see this in the following link : Hubble Chemically Analyzes the Ring around Supernova 1987A The trememdous radiation of the supernova permits the formation of elements with atomic numbers higher than iron . The force of these explosions scattered the newly created elements , creating vast gas and dust clouds . Eventually , the shockwave of another explosion initiated the collapse of one of these clouds , and the spinning hydrogen cloud begins to heat , eventually initiating nuclear fusion , and becoming our sun . As the sun began to increase it 's heat output , the volatile remains of the accretion disk are driven away from the inner portion of the solar system , leaving mostly heavy elments . Comets bombarded the inner solar system , transporting water , carbon , and amino acids to the newly forming earth , making dirt . In short , a truely wonderful creation .
They do n't have to . The government is exercising violence by threatening people with jail time if they cause injury to somebody else who 's attacking them .
The comment of someone with an IQ of about 48 . Ray M .
Gee , Jo , you really should have read your sources . There is one part in here about the French 'navy ' and Churchill you really should read
The dictionary.com definition is vague , whether you use all 5 divisions of the definition , or only the first one that you quoted . I think that 's what Grocott was saying - that it 's not definable in a precise , non controversial way so that everyone can agree on exactly what it includes and what it does not . Even the word `` phenomena '' is vague . The reason I said ( and maintain ) that it 's a murky combination of facts and theories is because it can branch off in different ways and follow different paths , depending on the presuppositions ( worldviews ) of those assigned the duty of directing it . In this case it 's the teaching establishment . There is only a finite amount of instruction time in schools . Some paths get more time , attention , and detail allotted to them than do other paths .
Well either the Pottenger cat/pig/mouse thing is either the truth or they made the whole thing up . I think we are seeing a mirror of this experiment in society today ... please notice how diseases are striking people at younger and younger ages ... .it 's not going to get any better , either because people are not taught the reality about nutrition -- and that what they eat not only effects them , but their offspring as well .
If a woman does not want to be pregnant , she can abstain from sex . It works !
Oh they think they can Doc ! They think that we gun owners are the terrorist ! Personally . I think that all of this talk about Gun Control is happening because they are mad . They are MAD that a Black Man ! Is in the White House !
Actually , the storm lasted for 40 days and 40 nights . The ark was actually afloat for a year or so . So I guess the answer is that the ark had all kinds of pestilent insects winging about and biting and stinging the occupants . The problem is , how did these aquatic breeders actually propagate in the feces and urine infested bilge of the ark ?
Again , nonrandom is not the same as Lamarckian . Phenotypic variation can be nonrandom because the organisms can select the most attractive/successful mates with whom to breed . Once again , you 're totally stuck on one aspect of the ToE , random mutation ; the ToE is much more than that .
So the founding fathers and their work is basicy viewed as an authority based on their competence ?
ur wierd ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
And LIVING ones even more ... ok Adolph .
just curious ... what do you do for a living ?
So I got ta ask , how does that prove that evolution is allegedly atheistic when there are many other Gods out there ?
Or do you think that the Big Bang did n't happen ?
Many Atheists I have encountered call God a human effort in wish fullfillment . THat seeking God and salvation through Jesus Christ is an illusion . Many of these folks are quoting Freud whether they know it or not . Ha ! In the end , he was a Theist !
I 'd rather be `` offed '' than to live with a wild eyed screaming banshee like yourself setting policy and demanding impossible tasks . Are the police SOB 'S too ? I do n't suppose you would object to the friendly neighborhood rapist getting shot by a gun owning neighbor now would you ?
Good point . Touche . Though lots of folks have not had abortions . Certainly most men have not . I was just growing tired of a certain little poster 's uninformed opinions of sexual activity . My post was intended to be a little playful . If it missed the mark , mea culpa .
I thought the critical factors were ( are ) ; a : When does a child 's life begin ? b : When does a new child 's rights begin ? c : What are the possible justifications for denying the rights of the new child ( if any ) ? d : What ( if any ) should the punishment be for violating the child 's rights by killing him or her unjustly ? Can we not ( at least ) agree on what the `` critical factors '' are ? If not , is n't all subsequent debate destined to be non-productive ?
Okay its confusing enough without bring in new terms . Lets just leave it at human beings .
Ca n't argue with this illogic .
You know that under most public healthcare systems you can still buy private care if you really want to , do n't you ? As for OldSarge 's claim of bean pushers deciding what care you get , is n't another name for them `` claims adjustors '' ? When I go to see a doctor he 's the one who decides my treatment , not anyone else . He does n't have to call anyone to check the funding is there , if it 's covered for anyone , it 's covered for me as well .
Then they can seek permission from us to arm themselves , and only for official duties that require it . Afterwards they can just turn them in and go back to being in their proper place .
Do n't you think this would fit the 'Creationism is nothing but lie 's thread a bit better ? Although I notice The Skeptic making disparaging remarks about your examples , it seems he attacks you more than deal with the well documented examples you have .
And there we go again . Re-read the bit about dancing around the land mines , if you in fact did read it the first time .
I know that . I asked those questions to show how dumb and ridiculous unkerpaulies question was - took it to other examples where such a question is obviously ridiculous to illustrate the ridiculousness of his question .
Just because 99 % of astrophysicists believe that the earth orbits the sun , why should you ? Just because 99 % of medical doctors believe that germs cause disease , why should you ? Just because 99 % of geologists believe that plate subduction causes vulcanism , why should you ? ( I know I lost you on that one . ) Just because 99 % of physicists believe that the sun produces energy by nuclear fusion , why should you ? And that 's why I do n't consult my plumber or my mechanic about plantar fasciitis . What do you know that makes you better informed than thousands upon thousands of scientists who have spent decades of study in their subject . But you , who has n't read a single book or paper have done a `` detailed study '' ( of course with an open mind ) and concluded that you are right and they are wrong . Moreover , you think that the terminally ignorant should be allowed to vote on science .
Because quite simply , it is all what we observe . One has never observed a mutation that has been seen to increase the information in the genome . If there have been any mutations that have led to an increase in information , please state it .
Well , it also deprives that person of rethinking their life , and maybe become a missionary for children in Afirca or something . You can not judge a man 's life on what he has done , you can judge him about those acts , but not his entire life . The death penalty is a contradictory measure . On one side , we say we want to protect the value of human life by putting murderers in jail , but on the other , we show utter contempt for that same value . How can you say you are protecting the life of your citizens ( because you value it ) , while at the same time you end someone else 's life . This is absurd .
But you ca n't . You may imagine it but you ca n't present evidence that supports your position . You can only argue against what you do n't understand in the first place . I generally make it a rule to keep my mouth shut unless I have actually had the integrity to educate myself about the basics of a topic . You do n't seem to do the same .
Yea , i got one about the UK . Let me find it , hold on .
-- -- -- -- At first glance this statute seems to merely track the now-expired federal AW ban , and I would watch out to see if its supporters are selling it as such . It is in reality far more restrictive than the expired federal ban ! I dont know if it is being sold as merely a common sense state enactment of the old federal ban that expired and no longer protects us ,  but if it is , then here is why that argument is fraudulent : The old federal ban was far less restrictive because it defined an AW ( in addition to some firearms deemed automatically an AW ) as having 2 or more of the cosmetic features , while this new statute says it needs only 1 cosmetic feature . That is a significant difference which allows this proposed law to capture many more firearms than the old federal ban . It looks like the old federal ban definitions were used as a template for this new statute , but whoever wrote it decided to change it down to 1 offending cosmetic feature knowing full well it would ban far more firearms . If I were you I would let my legislator know this difference . For comparison , here are the AW definitions from the old federal AW ban : 18 U.S.C . § 921 is a listing of how terms are defined in the firearms offenses portion of the Code , and it defines a federally banned AW as follows : ( 30 ) The term `` semiautomatic assault weapon '' means - ( A ) any of the firearms , or copies or duplicates of the firearms in any caliber , known as - ( i ) Norinco , Mitchell , and Poly Technologies Avtomat Kalashnikovs ( all models ) ; ( ii ) Action Arms Israeli Military Industries UZI and Galil ; ( iii ) Beretta Ar70 ( SC-70 ) ; ( iv ) Colt AR-15 ; ( v ) Fabrique National FN/FAL , FN/LAR , and FNC ; ( vi ) SWD M-10 , M-11 , M-11/9 , and M-12 ; ( vii ) Steyr AUG ; ( viii ) INTRATEC TEC-9 , TEC-DC9 and TEC-22 ; and ( ix ) revolving cylinder shotguns , such as ( or similar to ) the Street Sweeper and Striker 12 ; ( B ) a semiautomatic rifle that has an ability to accept a detachable magazine and has at least 2 of - ( i ) a folding or telescoping stock ; ( ii ) a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon ; ( iii ) a bayonet mount ; ( iv ) a flash suppressor or threaded barrel designed to accommodate a flash suppressor ; and ( v ) a grenade launcher ; ( C ) a semiautomatic pistol that has an ability to accept a detachable magazine and has at least 2 of - ( i ) an ammunition magazine that attaches to the pistol outside of the pistol grip ; ( ii ) a threaded barrel capable of accepting a barrel extender , flash suppressor , forward handgrip , or silencer ; ( iii ) a shroud that is attached to , or partially or completely encircles , the barrel and that permits the shooter to hold the firearm with the nontrigger hand without being burned ; ( iv ) a manufactured weight of 50 ounces or more when the pistol is unloaded ; and ( v ) a semiautomatic version of an automatic firearm ; and ( D ) a semiautomatic shotgun that has at least 2 of - ( i ) a folding or telescoping stock ; ( ii ) a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon ; ( iii ) a fixed magazine capacity in excess of 5 rounds ; and ( iv ) an ability to accept a detachable magazine . ( 4 ) for any person , other than a licensed importer , licensed manufacturer , licensed dealer , or licensed collector , to transport in interstate or foreign commerce any destructive device , machinegun ( as defined in section 5845 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ) [ this being the tie-in to the NFA tax ban on machine guns ] Note , by the way , that these definitions still exist in the US Code and have NOT been repealed or have expired . What expired was a portion of another statute , which made it a crime to possess these weapons . For reference , that statute is 18 U.S.C . § 922 [ which lists several acts committed with firearms considered to be crimes . The AW ban added the following language , which has since expired but still exists in the Code ] : ( v ) ( 1 ) It shall be unlawful for a person to manufacture , transfer , or possess a semiautomatic assault weapon . ( 2 ) Paragraph ( 1 ) shall not apply to the possession or transfer of any semiautomatic assault weapon otherwise lawfully possessed under Federal law on the date of the enactment of this subsection . ( 3 ) Paragraph ( 1 ) shall not apply to - ( A ) any of the firearms , or replicas or duplicates of the firearms , specified in Appendix A to this section , as such firearms were manufactured on October 1 , 1993 ; ( B ) any firearm that - ( i ) is manually operated by bolt , pump , lever , or slide action ; ( ii ) has been rendered permanently inoperable ; or ( iii ) is an antique firearm ; ( C ) any semiautomatic rifle that can not accept a detachable magazine that holds more than 5 rounds of ammunition ; or ( D ) any semiautomatic shotgun that can not hold more than 5 rounds of ammunition in a fixed or detachable magazine . The fact that a firearm is not listed in Appendix A shall not be construed to mean that paragraph ( 1 ) applies to such firearm . No firearm exempted by this subsection may be deleted from Appendix A so long as this subsection is in effect . ( 4 ) Paragraph ( 1 ) shall not apply to - ( A ) the manufacture for , transfer to , or possession by the United States or a department or agency of the United States or a State or a department , agency , or political subdivision of a State , or a transfer to or possession by a law enforcement officer employed by such an entity for purposes of law enforcement ( whether on or off duty ) ; ( B ) the transfer to a licensee under title I of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 for purposes of establishing and maintaining an on-site physical protection system and security organization required by Federal law , or possession by an employee or contractor of such licensee on-site for such purposes or off-site for purposes of licensee-authorized training or transportation of nuclear materials ; ( C ) the possession , by an individual who is retired from service with a law enforcement agency and is not otherwise prohibited from receiving a firearm , of a semiautomatic assault weapon transferred to the individual by the agency upon such retirement ; or ( D ) the manufacture , transfer , or possession of a semiautomatic assault weapon by a licensed manufacturer or licensed importer for the purposes of testing or experimentation authorized by the Secretary . ( w ) ( 1 ) Except as provided in paragraph ( 2 ) , it shall be unlawful for a person to transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device . ( 2 ) Paragraph ( 1 ) shall not apply to the possession or transfer of any large capacity ammunition feeding device otherwise lawfully possessed on or before the date of the enactment of this subsection . ( 3 ) This subsection shall not apply to - ( A ) the manufacture for , transfer to , or possession by the United States or a department or agency of the United States or a State or a department , agency , or political subdivision of a State , or a transfer to or possession by a law enforcement officer employed by such an entity for purposes of law enforcement ( whether on or off duty ) ; ( B ) the transfer to a licensee under title I of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 for purposes of establishing and maintaining an on-site physical protection system and security organization required by Federal law , or possession by an employee or contractor of such licensee on-site for such purposes or off-site for purposes of licensee-authorized training or transportation of nuclear materials ; ( C ) the possession , by an individual who is retired from service with a law enforcement agency and is not otherwise prohibited from receiving ammunition , of a large capacity ammunition feeding device transferred to the individual by the agency upon such retirement ; or ( D ) the manufacture , transfer , or possession of any large capacity ammunition feeding device by a licensed manufacturer or licensed importer for the purposes of testing or experimentation authorized by the Secretary . ( 4 ) If a person charged with violating paragraph ( 1 ) asserts that paragraph ( 1 ) does not apply to such person because of paragraph ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) , the Government shall have the burden of proof to show that such paragraph ( 1 ) applies to such person . The lack of a serial number as described in section 923 ( i ) of this title shall be a presumption that the large capacity ammunition feeding device is not subject to the prohibition of possession in paragraph ( 1 ) .
well heck , if lifeforms can not realistically be strung together by small , gradual , materialist increments ( which they ca n't and there is no evidence for ) then the only alternative is special creation .
Actually it started when they wrote the consitution - you can practice your religion , but you ca n't make me do it or even give a flying monkeys XXX about it .
Yes , but we had no way to tell until we found them again , now had we ?
Thomas favored incorporation through priviledges and immunities , correct ? That likely makes the most sense but the Court probably feared how far that could go , since the logical conclusion is the abolition of individual State law . Not that the `` substantive due process '' is well defined , but likely the Court felt they could rein in any excesses through that interpretation .
Here 's an interesting one : Lipoprotein Lipase S447X : A Naturally Occurring Gain-of-Function Mutation . Brief Reviews Arteriosclerosis , Thrombosis & amp ; Vascular Biology . 26 ( 6 ) :1236-1245 , June 2006 . Rip , Jaap ; Nierman , Melchior C. ; Ross , Colin J. ; Jukema , Jan Wouter ; Hayden , Michael R. ; Kastelein , John J.P. ; Stroes , Erik S.G. ; Kuivenhoven , Jan Albert Abstract : mdash ; : Lipoprotein lipase ( LPL ) hydrolyzes triglycerides in the circulation and promotes the hepatic uptake of remnant lipoproteins . Since the gene was cloned in 1989 , more than 100 LPL gene mutations have been identified , the majority of which cause loss of enzymatic function . In contrast to this , the naturally occurring LPLS447X variant is associated with increased lipolytic function and an anti-atherogenic lipid profile and can therefore be regarded as a gain-of-function mutation . This notion combined with the facts that 20 % of the general population carries this prematurely truncated LPL and that it may protect against cardiovascular disease has led to extensive clinical and basic research into this frequent LPL mutant . It is only until recently that we begin to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the beneficial effects associated with LPLS447X . This review summarizes the current literature on this interesting LPL variant . This one provides rather good protection from hardening of the arteries .

Actually , I had heard it several times on radio talk shows that normally do research before making claims . I then read it on several sites that cited the U.S. Census Records as their source . Since the radio shows and the websites all credited the U.S.Census , I perceived that they could not have made it up ... since they all matched within acceptable tolerances . It does seem reasonable to you that such information could be gleaned from the census data ... does it not ? Will you agree that what they say is true ?
I wonder what the 2nd DOES grant then ... . Any answers to that , VoR ?
Sorry Ray , but your `` effects '' should be `` affects '' . Perhaps you need lessons in the English language too ?
Yes , really . Lungs from swim bladders ? Takes millions upon millions of years ? What 's so crazy about that ? Again , minor changes over sufficient time add up to what ? What makes you think that lots of little changes ca n't do the job ( apart from incredulity , that is ) ? Where is the barrier to stop minor changes adding up to big changes ? Where did you get the idea that a dog evolved to a human ? It 's exactly that kind of comment that makes people with a smattering of scientific education say 'go read a book on biology before you say that dogs evolved into humans ' . Humans did not evolve from dogs and ToE has never suggested that this is so . It 's that kind of comment that makes me wonder how much you know about biology . My nephew knows that humans evolved from human like ancestors ; not dogs and he 's only 11 , for Christ sake !
Really ? And how do you come to this conclusion ? Are there a lot of teen-age suicide notes that complain of being rearranged pondscum ? And what does `` rearranged pondscum '' have to do with evolution , anyway ?
I was reminded of this , also ...
Well for one thing , Darwin did not know about genetics . He knew there was a mechanism , but did not know what that mechanism could be . As for everything else , you are making what is known as a 'straw man ' , also assertions without evidence , and just plain bad logic .
Just going on what you have posted here .. ..it looks like the first verse is decribing manslaughter - two men fighting - they bump into a pregnant woman - her baby dies ... or does it ? . ..the second verse is describing murder .
You know , I would be fine with that as long as it were truly a middle ground . If that term were used equally among straights as well as gays . But it 's just a term . The same as with the term `` marriage . '' It 's just a term . Just a word . Personally I feel the government needs to get out of the business of marriage altogether . Let the legal term be agreed upon unilaterally .
Oh , so you were not in any way talking about evolution in these posts ? Then why are they posted on the c vs e board ? Please , that 's just pathetic .
Or was it a true reptile ? Or both , or something in between ? I forget .
Oh , just come right out and say it , women are subhuman , all they are is wombs . Come on , let 's show the true colors of the pro-fetus movement .
The only people who get out of hand are criminals . Decent people do not get out of hand with firearms . So not to worry , your OK if all decent people are armed .
Walking-fish : I basically agree with you . I guess I was being redundant in this regard . I was thinking out loud , in cyberspace . But it is interesting that we humans may be the first species to actually go beyond the need for this death & amp ; reproduction cycle by genetically or artificially reinventing ourselves . But now I 'm thinking out loud again on the web .
Good has nothing do with logic . Explain what good and logic have in common ? ? ? ? The Christian theistic worldview can account for the laws of logic by stating that they come from God . God is transcendent ; that is , He is beyond the material universe being its creator . God has originated the laws of logic because they are a reflection of His nature . Therefore , the laws of logic are absolute . The are absolute because there is an absolute God . The atheistic worldview can not account for the laws of logic/absolutes , and must borrow from the Christian worldview in order to rationally argue .
Actually , Peeling and others on this thread have proven you and Cash to be utterly wrong . The fact you do n't recognize this is irrelevant .
Get the red star arms trigger ... .. Freekin awsome . Get the ultimack foward rail and mount an OKO red dot ... Get a KVAR synthetic stock set ( I got OD green ! ) TOO cool ... . Then get 5k rounds and shoot the hell out of it !

would this be considered intelligent design ? to me it would be like winding up a top , loading it with paint , and then letting it spin on paper to create a painting . the process is deliberately set in motion , but the painting itself is random and not deliberate . where the paint falls is not by design , even though the overall pattern would be . anyway , to answer the question , there are lots of people who believe in a creator as well as evlution , so the beliefs are not mutually exclusive . the problem is that christianity depends upon the account of genesis being true . spontaneous origin is mutually exclusive to genesis , but evolution by itself is not necessarily . but evolution poses other problems such as the age of the earth and the existence of dinosaurs that creationists are stumped by . in order to belief in evolution , you must , at the very least , disregard the genesis account . and disregarding genesis automatically invalidates christianity . but it doesnt necessarily invalidate the existence of a creator . pretty wierd , huh ?
Wise words !
You know , I can not even remember if we covered it in middle school or high school biology . I do remember learning about Mendel and his genetics , but I swear I ca n't remember if we even mentioned Darwin 's name . If we spent any time on it at all , it was very little . Our biology classes were mostly devoted to taxonomy , anatomy/physiology , and cellular machinery .
Sarah Brady is a straw purchaser then . She knowingly broke the law by buying a gun for somebody else instead of letting them go through the NICS check system . Who knows what else she 's done and who she 's supplied guns to .
So , a human-mother is equal to the abilities/wisdom of God now ? - Interesting thing : How many mothers do *you* know , who can successfully *champion* a person ( hiding in coma-states of mind ) ? Annie
The same can be said with a woman 's reproductive rights as well . Your right to tell her what to do ends at her body .
Mmmmm , not necessarily . Many of the arguments of against gods ( those with specific properties , not just a general diety ) deal with incompatible traits , like a square circle has . One does not have to search the universe to know square circles do not exist . People state simple negatives all the time . The lack of evidence for the positive makes them reasonable .
See above . Give kids credit . You give them a bogus answer and they will know . We have got to stop treating sex like a dirty little secret .
Actually , Dembski is known for his useless maths . As you so enjoy reading Berlinski , do you agree with his take on ID ?
Well , that 's because all those things happened during the Age of Law ( the god of swift and harsh justice bit ) , whereas now we 're in the Age of Grace ( the god is all-forgiving bit ) , so . . . . er . . . hang on a minute .
Well , both traffic in waste material . Many traps are present in each for them to function properly . And do n't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you -- into a cesspool .
These two issues ( abortion and sexual abuse among priests ) are completely unrelated . The problems in one area have no bearing on the credibility the church has in the other . This is a classic case of a non-sequitur .
You 're right it 'll be fighting the war in Iraq . ) Nah , really it 'll be from social security , etc etc .
So true . That was my mistake as i was envisioning Lucy as she was when she existed .
And I was n't asked if I wanted my federal tax dollars to go towards hetero benefits and to support their walking sperm .
So SS . Please explain it all to me . Please show that you are not conclusion jumping and making unwarranted extrapolation based on poor understanding of the material . In other words , show me that you understand by explaining the research to me . Thanks .
I never said anything about a conspiracy Peeling . I very clearly gave valid reasons to Consider that scientific GRANTS and pay increases for these scientists are based on making new and previously undiscovered claims that forward the science . That is the greatest motivation to lie , cheat , create and falsify evidence which adds to the scientists personal wealth and further promotes a false science that is rife with selfish motivations to preserve , protect and promote it .
Exactly . It seems that anyone can dream up hypotheses in evolutionary psychology . Here 's what Coyne said :
And few people hold that view anymore .
Oh goodie , same MO . First a biased claim repeated on Yahoo from canned propaganda source , VPC with a few quotes from staunch marxists that would like to ignore the Second Amendment and the entire Constitution , then you include the suppositions and dire warnings which have never come true but you are not finished yet . Your quote contains the usual lies about training and education plus an appeal to interfere with State Rights which 34 States have specifically stated their support of through their State AG . Not enough yet ? `` well it 's a right '' is no longer an argument , it is fact . Read Heller v D.C. and the myriad of cases including 35 Supreme Court cases that have always held the Second Amendment protects those individual rights . Even Roe v Wade states the rights found in the BOR such as ... '' the right to keep and bear arms '' to be a fundamental right . What you have is an unConstitutional right being demeaned by a person who swore an oath to protect and defend it ... making them/him a traitor .
And now you say that gun owners are cowards ?
To me , part of the point of the `` please , no scripture '' comment would be to forgo any insistence that we worship God just because the bible says to . A person could insist that sons pay some form of homage / respect to their father on Father 's Fay , but I would argue that it 's not reasonable to do so in every case . For example , if the father was physically or sexually abusive , or the father abandoned his children , those would be reasons to fore-go any Father 's Day formalities . And `` God '' could be viewed as the absent father . Suppose we assume that he created the earth and life on the earth . What 's his involvement been since then ? Should we worship him just because he 's God ? Or , depending upon how one sees God , is God a being unworthy of worship and idolization ? And along those lines , utilizing the Bible as a reference could be a double-edged sword . The `` God '' of the Old Testament ordered slavery , misogyny , genocide , women as spoils of war , ...
Because nobody could be anymore fraudulent than your own Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center , right ? Simply because you call our sources frauds does n't mean they are , Brady . They 're accurate whether you like them or not . Meanwhile the VPC is slowly dying off , losing more and more members each day , and slipping into obscurity .
Well , here 's another quote from Allan Feduucia : `` Feathers are unique to birds , and no known structure intermediate between scales and feathers has been identified . '' ( J. Alan Feduccia , The Age of Birds , Harvard University Press , 1980 , pg . 52 ) Sounds contradictory to me !
This joke is based on some reality , `` the conquest of the North Pole is traditionally credited to Anglo-American Navy engineer Robert Edwin Peary , who claimed to have reached the Pole on April 6 , 1909 . Anyhow , not all jokes are completely true , how many stand up comedians have you heard ? ? ? If you were to nit pick every joke out there ( being politicaly correct etc ) there would be no jokes left !
Well , yeah , of course . Put some DNA in a dish and it wo n't do very much at all ; it 's not exactly news that the surrounding developmental machinery is significant too . We 're just in the process of establishing to what degree that machinery is 'general purpose ' , and to what degree it encodes specific traits . The rest of your post just goes completely off the rails . Nowhere does the article mention DNA ( or anything else for that matter ) being designed to suit the purposes of the organism , so I 'm not sure why you 're getting so excited .
Stop telling me to look at the big picture when you 've had both of your eyes gouged out ! Your entire statement here is beyond stupid . If the criminals felt that the only time to be armed was when their intended victims could fight back , then the criminals in DC would never be armed and the police would n't have needed to introduce gun shot sensors in the city . But since DC was the murder capital of the United States , that says an absence of hard targets is n't a guarantee that the abusers will play fair and not use weapons .
no they are not . you quote a web site that is not dawkin 's interpretations of biomorphs and suggest that the web site 's interpretation is what dawkins created biomorphs for . it is outlines very clearly in `` the blind watchmaker '' as to what limitations should be put on the biomorphs when comparing them to real life . again i say to reclaim integrity admit that dawkins never suggested that biomorphs should be considered as a model for evolution or natural selection , and there was only one main point to be taken from them ( small mutations are more likely to produce benefits than large mutations ) .
Well , the point about evolution is that it does n't need a god to tinker with it . Maybe you can postulate a god as the prime mover of the big bang , I do n't know why you 'd want to , but i suppose you could . After that , the laws of physics take over , and evolution is the result . Even if one were to suppose a god initiated the big bang , there is no reason to suppose it took an interest in subsequent events , or nudged them down one path as opposed to any other . Evolution does n't need a deity in its daily operation ... that 's why it works so well as science !
So what 's your solution ; lay down and die ? We 've already seen that the UK is n't going to punish career criminals . How else can you have 50 convictions and still be on the streets robbing people ?
Not entirely true . While we ca n't disprove that God created the universe , we can disprove many creationist claims . For example , we can disprove that the earth is 6000 years old .
And yet , in this case , your candidate emphatically says no to supporting gay marriage . And you are n't outraged by that ? That 's what I do n't understand . The article focused on Palin 'needing to clarify ' , but did n't even take Biden to task for being against gay marriage !
I dunno . Do you think the Tooth Fairy will be happy with people drink-driving ? Any argument from a religious stand-point necessitates proving that said religion is true . Do that , and you 'll get a lot of respect from a lot of people .
You are n't helping your cause with statements like this . In logical debate , your claims are considered to be false until proven true , not the other way around . Nobody can disprove the existence of god , but that is not proof of god 's existence .
Because all scientists hate god , this is a fact .
Someone who actually had knowledge about the Civil War would certainly know that Lincoln did not believe the Union could be preserved unless slavery was abolished .
And many of those countries are having problems with it . Furthermore , we are n't even proposing what other countries have .
Actually insurance and drug companies love fascist `` reforms '' , because they eliminate the need for competition . Insurance and drug companies utterly support forcing people to buy insurance . Spare us the tired michael moore government vs corporations rhetoric , it 's obvious they 're both on the same side . And if you did n't realise that after the bank bailouts , the only healthcare you 're in need of is a lobotomy .
Superstition . You are deceived if you think your holey book is historically and scientifically accurate in every detail . It was written by bronze age hersdmen . Open your eyes .
Well Im not hunting animals
And Hamilton 's writings in Federalist 28 . FEDERALIST No . 28 HAMILTON
Well is n't the beilef commonly held that women will be damned if they commit abortion unless they repent ? I think that veiw is primarily the one doing the demoniaing is n't it ? - '' I may be going to hell in a bucket ... . '' But at least I stand up for what I believe .
If the fetus is human is not relevant ? So if everyone says it is human then it still does n't have a right to live then huh ? Do you really support the killing of an innocent life for whatever reason ? Do you really think placing one human over another is good ( in this case women is more important then baby ) ?
This also applies to tapeworms . I fail to see how it is therefore relevent to any debate on abortion .
Of course they do . Just look at Black Phoenix . You would probably be suprised how many people believe just like he does . I live in the Bible belt , so the majority of people I know are creationists .
First , abiogensis is n't part of evolution , two , if we used your logic , if no one was there to observe it , nothing can be proved . Does a tree that falls in the woods make a sound if no one is there to observe it ? If a man says something stupid and a woman is n't there to call him on it , did he say something stupid ? The logic is faulty . Just because we were n't there to observe it , does not mean it did not happen . let 's apply the logic to your argument . Since no human was there to observe Genesis , it therefore did not happen ? How do you like your own logic being used aganist you ?
But if the repeated tests just confirm the same errors or misinterpretations of the results , all of the independent reviews in the World wont make a difference .
But these organisms have n't always existed .
Because their properties are contradictory .
Yes California is following European socialism . Just like socialist Europe , they are going broke . Socialism depends on large income taxes to fund social programs . Try the same taxes here in the USA and people will get thier guns and shoot all the politicians trying to tax them . Remember this country was born over a fight over taxes .
Personally , I do n't see what the big deal is . In my opinion ( as someone who has read a lot of the early church writings ) it is clear from writings of very early people like Clement , Ignatius , Justn Martyr , etc that what we consider orthodoxy was indeed orthodoxy from the get-go , and so it is only fair that they had some sense of wanting to keep out writings that they did n't consider accurate or genuine . People sometimes bring this us as if it indicates something bad about Christianity or early Christianity , but why should they have allowed writings into the canon that they considered spurious ? ( Now whether the canonical writings we have are spurious too is another debate -- the bottom line is that THEY -- the early Christians -- did n't feel at the time that the NT books in our canon were spurious for the most part . ) Now one of the things people will sometimes say is `` well , THOSE Christians won the day , and the Gnostics/Arians did n't , so there may have been gnostic or Arian writers that got suppressed so we do n't really know . '' Well , you could ALWAYS make that argument about ANYTHING . We do n't come to hard conclusions based on material for which we have no idea was there -- a speculative basis -- we come to hard conclusions based on what IS there . Sure , there 's a general understanding with history the winners write the history , but that does n't mean we go back and fill in blanks or overwrite what we accept with speculation .
no it is not . Darwinists say that evolution happens by way of selection of random variants ... ..what I 'm asking for is for science to make sure the variants do n't arise nonrandomly . I 'm looking for experiments on animals that rule out heritable , adaptive variation . Here you go . that 's not a controlled experiment . try again . How do you carbon-date a rock ? you do n't ... you break open the `` rock '' and carbon date the soft , flexible parts that somehow survived for 100 million years without turning to stone . ( It would also help if you broke the big bones open and looked for such tissue ... something science evidently never has done either until Mary S. did it a couple years ago . Apart from the 'horizontally instead of vertically ' part which I did n't understand - I say new , beneficial traits arise across a given population at the same time because the traits arise from within each creature . Likewise genes may be transferred from one species to another horizontally , without selection . Scientists pick holes in Darwin moth theory by Robert Matthews in the Sunday Telegraph ( March , 1999 ) Nothing from the New York Times ? I 'll check this out though . I 'm not sure what you mean by the other side of the debate , though . ID ? EAM ? YEC ? anti-darwinian . SS : Show me one instance of a genetic mistake ( random mutation/copying error ) that that created a beneficial body part . What do you mean by 'part ' ? If you 're asking for an example of a single mutation that created an arm or a leg where none existed before , then you 're asking for evidence of something that the ToE in no way shape or form says is possible . ok ... .I 'll save that . Sickle-cell is a pretty good example , though , if you 're prepared to accept blood as a 'body part ' . I 'm not ... .besides , sickle cell adds nothing benefical in the way of phenotype . We 've been over this here . Have anything else ? Strictly speaking , accumulation of mutations alone is n't what creates a new species ; so long as a species interbreeds well , well since you ca n't show me one case of speciation , with backup that the old and the new species ca n't interbreed and produce viable offspring , we 'll just assume that it ca n't be done at all . SS : Show me one instance of a mutation that formed a new organ or limb . Not possible , and not predicted or required by the ToE either , so it 's a strawman . cool , ok ... we agree there . Do you think a mutation can create a partial organ or limb ? ... like say 1/100th of one -- and be selected for ? Pretty much every experiment ever carried out in a petri-dish ; take your pick Also the revisited peppered moth experiment I linked to earlier . those are not animals and it 's not RMNS ... .it 's simply a fluid , adaptive genome at work . If RMNS worked in the petri dish then it should work by way of controlled experiments on actual animals -- which ToE scientists refuse to do . SS : show me set of skeletons that transition from ape to man by way of small modifications . I can show you skeletons showing the transition from ape ancestors to man , if that 's any use ? yes , it is of use -- show me . SS : Explain to me why we dont see humans or dogs or alligators with accidental wings forming . ( If the possibility was there for random mutations to produce wings on reptiles or mammals in the past , then it should also be happening now . ) Oh dear ; where do I even start ? Ok , look , the ToE does n't say that the possibility was ever there for random mutation to suddenly make wings appear out of nowhere . It just does n't . Ha ! do you agree that the first winged animals came from non-winged animals or not ? If so , what 's the difference ?
Certainly , because with calm empathy you can casually address such a matter simply because the struggle does not pertain to you personally . To be able to put into question the love of another human being is simply not only alarming in nature , but damning to the very definition of love , equality , and freedom in creation of man ... . And to trump this as a question of morality only serves as a mask to curtail the prejudice objections one personally has to a ceremony , right , and relationship that person will not even be personally affected by ... .
In this case , I have to agree with you . We 're talking about the most absolute bizarrely liberal ( to the point of absurdity ) place in the country . The idea of 'rights ' has gotten dog-gone crazy there . . . they even regulate the nutritional content of food for pets , and require dog-houses have raised floors in them . They 've basically done away with a number of illegal drug laws . They 're working to BAN handgun ownership altogether . ( One has to wonder how we can take their insistence of gay marriage as being constitutional seriously when they are trying to completely ignore the 2nd Amendment ! ) Despite their liberal regulatory fanaticism , it 's actually a very beautiful place to visit !
Well now , there you go . . . .RIGHT ON ! !
The reason no one corrected him is because he was n't wrong . Canis is the genus , lupus is the species-Canis lupus is a wolf . Canis familiaris is a domesticated dog .
You see , that 's the problem : `` generally '' . You obviously know little or nothing of how prejudice works in this country .
This is n't assumed in the studies . Nearly 35 % of all arable land used worldwide is used to feed livestock .
Scientists do not want to ( and/or are not allowed to ) do experiments on animals that will kill some of them . All of the evidence that you will find will be based on experiments that do not harm animals ( except , of course , for insects ) .
Actually all type fossils are given scientific names , and while this may be impressive-sounding to scientific illiterates , it is actually standard procedure . But more about reconstructions later .
I was just following your logic to its ultimate logical conclusion . Liberals do n't give a damn about individual freedom ; they want governmental control over all aspects of your life . They want gov't control of healthcare because they think we 're too dumb to fend for ourselves . They want to indoctrinate our kids in school because they do n't trust parents to be parents . The list of liberal intrusisms into our lives is endless . And I have no problem with gays , just their attempts to redefine marriage .
I 'll give you that , though there is a whole school of debate about what thoughts are .
So you do n't believe that life had an origin ! WOW so you think its always been present on the Earth ? Not even the bible goes that far ! And you fail to account for the observation that there IS life .
Talking about traitors , brady you are IT . Meanwhile on the other board you started previous to cutting and running like the coward you obviously are , Bryan posted a challenge to you . If you choose to accept the challenge which I have money that you do not accept , ( so do n't dissapoint me ) , be sure to read his guidelines so you will not make strawman arguments and red herring arguments . I am betting you can not carry on a sustained debate without falling flat on your face
Ah , but the issue in this thread is what the fetus really means to anti-choicers/anti-lifers .
Just where did the word desire appear ? Read the black part only .
Three questions : What country operates under an `` unbridled capitalism '' system ? Can you name any nation that has operated under your idea of socialism successfully ? If the American system of government is so terrible , why do we have one of the highest standards of living on earth ? Just because you think you are entitled to what I earn does n't make it so . Earn your own .
So what is the bible then ? Simply a nice story-book for you to read from ? If Genesis is simply a representative story from which we can interpret the actions of god to mean natural selection and evolution , what about the ten commandments ? It always amazes me to hear people with positions like this insist that it is okay to play fast and loose with their interpretations of Genesis or the Arc , but God really does hate the homosexuals . It says so in Leveticus , right ? So it must be word perfect truth ... This bit about the origins of the earth ? Oh , we just interpret that as god designing evolution . But that part about people burning in hell for eternity , that 's true , right ?
That 's a bad term . I would n't call myself that , but I do know more then average person .
Get real ! Here 's what the verses say .
No , you believe we have a human responsibility to the government . There is a huge difference between charity and the government threatening people with jail or death if they do n't hand over their wallets .
We often have debates in our Sixth Form ( College ) , but I have also attended several `` debate camps '' - each a weekend long . I also attended a day at oxford which was made up of a few formal debates and just a bit of teaching on Philosophy and Classics . Apart from that - I have been on debate forums for quite some time , and I 've gained experience from there too .
Why would they be useless ? They are n't useless on birds ? And how is this qustion different in any meaningful way from the above ? Are n't wings forelimbs with feathers ? It seems that soaring or gliding or even faster running would be extremely useful .
So , in order to be against gay marriage , a person has to be faithful in his own marriage ? Gim me a break . He supports what his constituents want him to support or he does n't get elected . In case you have n't noticed , the majority of Americans are against gay marriage .
Yes , it is human , biologically . However , it isnt a human being as it isnt alive .
And were THIS the 17th century , I might understand that , but this is the 21st century . We do n't `` bleed '' people to make them well ; we do n't have barbers performing surgery and we usually have a trained physician in the delivery room .
Tell this to those infants and adults in the netherlands who are being euthanized against their will . this is a logical conclusion of a quality of life ethic without a sanctity of life basis .
I think it is more cut and dry than you think . Some of us have a higher law than the US code . You might have a similiar hierachy of how you go about deciding right and wrong . A difference might be that my wants are below the law while your wants are above the law ... would this be a fair representation ? ( note : I do n't mean 'above the law ' as to imply that you think you are mightier than everyone )
Believe me , marc , we certainly can . The fact that it damns your argument is no skin off our backs . In fact , it damns your argument so much that the producers know it . See below .
Well maybe that will teach him to get a education for once . Still , my analogy is quite true . Furthermore both words are meant by creationists to argue evolution is faith . Dishonest , but that is essentialy the mantra of creationism . `` Lie , cheat , steal and fabricate to get people to be believe . ''
That 's good . You 're right , all we can do is hope and pray ( I pray for things like this every day , and in a way , God has answered my prayer in this case ) .
Hang on ... .think about it ... ... .if there is a large group of people who live in the south , and this large group of people moved to the north , WHY -- being from the south -- would there be anyone in the population that had light skin ? Look at Iraq -- all those people have the same exact skin color . Same with Kenya . Same with Japan . Same with Russia . Thus , if any of those groups of people were to migrate , they 'd all be in the same boat ! There would be NO measurable variation of skin color . Your premise is faulty -- as is the whole premise of Toe .
No , it is n't .
Well , first of all , the 2nd Amendment is quite regulated , so do n't think regulations are an answer . The Unregulated Gun
Really ? Care to point out which facts she misrepresented ? It is our contention that it 's the pro-death advocates who misrepresent the facts in order to justify their infanticidal proclivities and justifications as they release women of all personal responsibility and expect the innocent child to be sacrificed at the alter of their immoral lifestyle so they can continue to act irresponsibly .
and this :
see , in the US we have a thing called `` laws '' and these `` laws '' are what the courts are supposed to go by . What their personal feelings that have are not relevant to any court case ( or should n't be that is ) . So yes , it was the correct decision based on the laws . As a side note , if you wish to change a law we have a congress that does that .
No disagreements . Something left out ( probably because it was assumed ) , is memory . What you call mental existence I would say is a description of what causes or leads to personal identity . To me it is self evident that there is no person or personhood without a personal identity . There might be disagreement about what the particulars are concerning how to identify a personal identity , but it seems self evident to me that a mind is required , and without a brain , there is no mind , so a brain is required . It seems to me self evident that if there is no brain , there is no person . Of course , others will disagree . Some say that the unique DNA of a zygote is enough for personal identity , but if this is true , identical twins ( with identical DNA ) would have to share one personal identity , and one soul . In the case of a chimera , two souls/unique DNA in two zygotes , would have to blend into one person/soul . ( No , most chimeras are not schizophrenic ) . I believe an integral part of [ personal identity > mental existence > personhood ] is memory . Whether it is short term , or long term , without memory there is no sense of self . ( I may be stating the obvious , but you never know . ) ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ It is not clear if your list of indicators for mental existence is one will suffice , or several are required . I dont think it matters all that much , but Im not sure , just wondering .
Sure . I would like to discuss the first one . It shows obvious similarities that are almost certainly not coincidencial . In part I , the fish and salamander look similar to everything else ( note the curvature and the small flaps under the head ) . However , in parts II and III , the fish and salamander begin to look different . You can see where this is leading , right ? It is leading to the assertion that these organisms are related , but that the fish and reptiles are not as closely related to the mammals as the mammals are related to each other . This assertion is also backed up by the fossil record , but that is n't as visible as this picture .
The bahavior is only `` morally corrupted '' if there is , in fact , something wrong with what they did . I do n't see it .
`` A story in some early editions of yesterday 's Daily News incorrectly reported that gun-control advocate Sarah Brady may have skirted Delaware 's gun laws when she bought a rifle for her adult son but did not declare who was going to own the weapon . `` The Delaware Department of Justice initially insisted to The News that gun purchasers must declare who the weapon was intended for so that person 's background could be checked . Yesterday , a spokeswoman for the Delaware Department of Justice said it misinterpreted the law and that Brady was not obligated to state that the gun was for her son as long as he was legally qualified to own a firearm . `` In addition , a spokesman for Brady said , 'Sarah Brady told the gun store that the gun was for her son and filled out the forms that they asked her to fill out . ' `` The News regrets the error . '' CORRECTION
For sure about 6000 years .
I think it is hilarious that you still think that in order to do a detailed study of evolution , you have to read 10 different books on it and take brainwashing classes from a university . Maybe you just like making yourself feel superior to me ... who knows ...
You are SO insulting . `` Oh , the poor dears have been through too much and are considering an action I disagree with so they must not be thinking clearly . '' Who are you to say they are n't thinking clearly ? I 'll give it to you , Bassman . You are the most polite , best veiled misogynist I have ever encountered . You nearly had me fooled .
And what did I say ? I quoted the title of the video , said `` Enjoy '' and labeled the link `` link '' So how is saying `` enjoy '' and `` link '' which were MY words mockery ? The only thing that suggests otherwise is the VIDEO 's Title , which I did not create .
Actually it has been prosecuted under 42 UDC 1981 and 1986 . It dates back to the first Civil Rights ruling in , oh , about 1866 but I would have to check the date to be certain . That is one reason Thomas and Stevens felt it was incorporated under the P or I clause . What is your point about the rifle comment ? Did it just sound cool so you threw that out there for the cats ?
Define `` many '' . What you really mean one is too much . Even when the one is used soles for personal defense . Besides your in Austraila , no one cares what you think .
Chalk it up to the fact that -- although not all the time -- a good part of the time , the same people are pretty anti-anything education . We should n't expect them to argue positions that make sense .
Well , I did n't really mean to go that far . But I 'm talking about problems like that all worked out , thought about previously , and that the problem was worked out . I 'm talking more about , what if you could make laborers stronger , scientists smarter , and rid us of physical and mental abnormalities ( such as down syndrome , narcolepsy , etc . ) . I do n't think of making everyone the same for that reason . I 'm just saying , what if there was a way to better society without going overboard ? If the problems were worked out , which I 'm sure they will be , what would your moral view on it be ?
yes , we will send you to the camps and all of us will gather in our black robes and dance around a fire while we make you dig ditches .
Well , if you breed them , you could get taller monkeys with less hair ( and other humanlike characteristics ) . Even so , it would take a long time .
Actually even with a concealed weapons permit , I do not believe you are allowed to possess a firearm on board an aircraft . The Second Amendment protects the right to OWN firearms and other weapons , and to use them in self defense . It does not grant a person the right to bring a gun on a plane , nor do I see how it could be interpreted to mean such a thing . Where do you get this question ? And terrorists already recieve their weapons illegally . It is NOT LEGAL for any country to sell weapons to a terrorist country/nation/organization . But somehow they always get their hands on weapons . Hmm ... I do n't think they go out to their local shooting range and pick up a 9mm pistol . While it is possible ( if they passed the backgroud check that is ) , its not probable . Because they would still have the illegal avenue to pursue the purchase of firearms with . If you want to ban firearms , the only thing you 're doing is taking away the rights of citizens to defend themselves . Terrorists and criminals in general will find a way to obtain the firearms they desire no matter what laws are in effect . Llike they would follow the laws anyways ? They ARE terrorists you know . )
Generally , when someone posts an article without a disclaimer , they agree with the findings and the reasoning of the article provided . Besides , your statement does not change the fact that the reasoning provided is foolish .
Well , since you have natural selection completely wrong , it must not go too well with the Biblical account . By the way , now you have introduced another word that has no meaning in the context . What is a `` kind . '' Please be specific so that I will be able to recognize a `` kind . '' Please show why a `` kind '' only has the ability to lose information .
I thought we were assuming it was true ?
And it 's a lot easier to kill people in a crowd when using a car or a truck than with a gun . The entire `` Easier to kill '' argument is rather irrelevant , because there 's always something that makes it easier to kill somebody with when compared to something else . You 've also failed to show why your statement is justification for attempting to ban a legal product . So how about you explain that .
And what does Marc do ? Try to change the subject .
and here in the Preamble Bill of Rights
First of all , welcome : D I believe as you do , that having a child is not always the best and most responsible thing to do in certain circumstances . For what it is worth , I think you did the right thing , for you and your current children .
I do n't agree with this debate . If preventing the Devil from interfering on earth should not be prevented by God then why is it that God did prevent the Devil from interfering in heaven after he was defeated ? They are both essentially taking the Devil away from an area where he could potentially harm those that are good . God seemingly saw fit for one to occur but not the other . Why would that be ?
And we 've already presented , countless times in the past , that all evidence points to less than 1 % of guns recovered from crimes being traced back to gun shows . Ergo there is no emergency that needs to be addressed by forcing private citizens to carry out documented transfers in a business setting .
Well , then , I guess that in America we ca n't possibly be safe from kill-happy gunners can we ?
I believe chloe is against the abortion aspect of the pill .
Actually the Apocrypha is made up of pre-Christian texts , and late 4th century is a bit of a stretch for the new testament , certainly all its component texts were widely accepted by the 2nd century . I do n't whether it is `` generally accepted '' that the text was altered , it seems to me that you are projecting your own views based on the hypotheses of some scholars on to Biblical scholarship in general .
Well sort of not .
Blah , blah , blah . Stop throwing out discredited and biased stories . Explain in your own terms , exactly how having a gun makes you more likely to be shot . Explain the mechanics of how this works . Go on and try , make some sense rather than cherry picking poorly executed `` studies '' that prove nothing . You made the claim that if you have a gun in your possession , this fact magnifies your chances of somehow being shot . What you suggest can only happen if magic somehow exists , like the legally-owned guns sends out powerful magnetic waves to attract the criminals and hypnotizes them to shoot in a situation that they normally would n't shoot .
Nothing at all .
And what all would they have to go through to get a CCW compared to a firearm ? I do n't need a list , just state how easy it is to get a CCW compared to getting a firearm . Like `` easier '' , `` same '' , `` not as easy '' , `` getting a gun automatically gets you a CCW '' , etc .
So gay people , in your opinion , have no right to form the families of their choice ? So you are defending the continued oppression of gay people ? We are sick of conservative family types . We are tired of the closet . The phrase `` we are mad as hell and we are not going to take it any more '' applies . I see in your response the comming of the camps to lock and exterminate gay people . It is that type of thought , that jews were subhuman , that led to the final solution . As it is here with conservatives and religious right nuts , who believe gay people are sub human sickos in need of curing or killing .
Oh , I LOVE semantics games
I do n't agree with this either/or binary logic .
Fossils are n't fake Mutz , the ages that the fake scientists attribute to them are , see what I mean ? And the petrified wood structure that exists on Mt Ararat is pretty impressive evidence that something big and made of wood is way up on the side of a mountain , and no one can figure why or how it got there other than by way of Noah 's flood . And here 's a scholarly article from the biblical perspective that points out the different interpretations Theologians consider , both conservative and liberal . http : //www.grisda.org/origins/22058.htm BIBLICAL EVIDENCE FOR THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE GENESIS FLOOD Richard M. Davidson John Nevin Andrews Professor of Old Testament Interpretation Old Testament Department Andrews University , Berrien Springs , Michigan Origins 22 ( 2 ) :58-73 ( 1995 ) . WHAT THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT The extent of the Genesis Flood has been vigorously debated by biblical scholars . For those who accept a recent creation week of six literal consecutive , twenty-four-days , a universal Flood is necessary to explain the existence of the geologic column . The thesis of this study is that only the traditional interpretation which posits a literal , universal , world-wide Genesis Flood does full justice to all the relevant biblical data . The author summarizes twenty-two lines of biblical evidence  including terminological , thematic , contextual , grammatical-syntactical , literary-structural , logical-conceptual , theological , canonical , and typological which support the universality of the Genesis Flood . PLEASE NOTE : Unfortunately , we are unable to reproduce all of the special accent marks that were present in our printed version of the Hebrew transliteration . Our apologies for any inconvenience this might cause . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I . Conflicting Schools of Interpretation One of the most controversial aspects of the Flood narrative concerns the extent of the Genesis Flood . Three major positions are taken : ( 1 ) the traditional , which asserts the universal , world-wide , nature of the Deluge ; ( 2 ) limited or local flood theories , which narrow the scope of the Flood story to a particular geographical location in Mesopotamia ; and ( 3 ) non-literal ( symbolic ) interpretation , which suggests that the Flood story is a non-historical account written to teach theological truth . Against this third position , the non-historical , we must note the evidences within the biblical account affirming the historical nature of the Flood . In the literary structure of the Flood story ( see Shea 1979 ) , the genealogical frame or envelope construction ( Genesis 5:32 and 9:28-29 ) plus the secondary genealogies ( Genesis 6:9-10 and 9:18-19 ) are indicators that the account is intended to be factual history . The use of the genealogical term tôledôt ( `` generations , '' `` account '' ) in the Flood story ( 6:9 ) as throughout Genesis ( 13 times , structuring the whole book ) , indicates that the author intended this story to be as historically veracious as the rest of Genesis ( Doukhan 1978 , p 167-220 ) . Walter Kaiser analyzes the literary form of Genesis 1-11 and concludes that this whole section of Genesis must be taken as `` historical narrative prose '' ( Kaiser 1970 ) . A number of references in the book of Job may allude to the then-relatively-recent Flood ( Job 9:5-8 ; 12:14-15 ; 14:11-12 ; 22:15-17 ; 26:10-14 ; 28:9 ; 38:8-11 ; see Morris 1988 , p 26-30 ) . The historical occurrence of the Flood is part of the saving/judging acts of God , and its historicity is assumed and essential to the theological arguments of later biblical writers employing Flood typology ( see Davidson 1981 , p 326-327 ) ; more on this point later . Thus according to the biblical writers , far from being a non-historical , symbolical , or mythical account written only to teach theological truths , the Flood narrative is intended to accurately record a real , literal , historical event . For evangelical Christians who take seriously the biblical record and accept the historicity of the Flood account , the question still remains whether the event described is to be taken as a local , limited flood or a universal , world-wide cataclysm . The limited flood theories rest primarily on scientific arguments that present seemingly difficult geological , biological , and anthropological problems for a universal flood . ( See Boardman 1990 , p 212-223 ; Custance 1979 , p 28-58 ; Kidner 1967 , p 93-95 ; Mitchell 1982/1993 ; Ramm 1954 , p 232-249 ; Young 1977 , p 171-210 ) . Since the scientific argumentation is not the subject of this article , I can only suggest that these problems are not insurmountable , although much more study is needed . A number of studies provides a growing body of evidence for diluvial catastrophism as an alternative to conventional long-age geology ( see Coffin and Brown 1983 ; Roth 1985 , 1986a , 1988 ; Whitcomb 1988 ; Baumgardner 1994a , b ) . The local flood theories further assert that the terminology describing the extent of the Flood should be interpreted in a relative and not absolute universal sense . The various seemingly universal terms are regarded as implying only a limited locality ; they are seen to indicate universality within the writer 's world-view but a limited scope in terms of our modern world view . ( See Boardman 1990 , p 223-226 ; Custance 1979 , p 15-27 ; Kidner 1967 , p 93-95 ; Ramm 1954 , p 241-242 . ) We will take up this issue in the next section of this article . The traditional conservative understanding of the Flood narrative is that Genesis 6-9 describes a universal , world-wide Deluge . It should be noted that this is also the view of the majority of liberal-critical commentators on Genesis 6-9 , although they regard the biblical view as borrowed from the ANE accounts and not historical . ( See Hasel 1975 , p 78 and Note 16 for bibliography of representatives of this position : Fohrer , Koehler , Noth , Procksch , Skinner , Sarna , Speiser , von Rad , Vriezen , Zimmerli , etc . Some of these and other more recent representatives of this view are cited later in this article . ) The thesis of this article is that only the traditional position of a literal , universal world-wide Flood does full justice to the biblical data , and this universal interpretation is crucial for Flood theology in Genesis and for the theological implications drawn by later biblical writers . II . Biblical Terminology in Genesis 6-9 Indicating Universality Perhaps the most important kind of biblical evidence for a universal Flood is the specific all-inclusive terminology found within the Genesis account itself . The late Gerhard Hasel has provided a careful treatment of this terminology in three penetrating studies in previous issues of Origins ( Hasel 1974 , 1975 , 1978 ) , and therefore I need not go into detail in this article . Eight different terms or phrases in Genesis 6-9 , most echoing their counterparts in the world-wide creation account of Genesis 1-2 , indicate universality . First , the term haÉares `` the earth , '' occurring 46 times in the Flood narrative ( Genesis 6:12 , 13 , 17 , etc . ) , always without any accompanying genitive of limitation , clearly parallels the usage of the same term in the account of world-wide , universal creation in Genesis 1:1 , 2 , 10 . ( While the term at times elsewhere may be used without a genitive and still in context be limited in scope to a certain `` land , '' the explicit link to creation in the Flood account ( see especially Genesis 6:6 , 7 ) clearly gives a universal context for its usage in Genesis 6-9 . ) Some have argued that if Moses had wished to indicate the entire world , he would have used the Hebrew term tebel , which means the world as a whole , or dry land in the sense of continents . This word is never used in the Flood narrative . But it should be pointed out that tebel is never used in the entire Pentateuch , including the creation account . In fact , the term appears no where in the narrative portions of the Hebrew Bible , but only in poetic texts ( 39 times ) usually as a poetic synonym in parallel with haÉares `` the earth . '' Thus this argument from silence does not adequately consider the contextual and poetic use of terminology , and carries little weight . A second expression , `` upon the face of all the earth '' Ìal-penê kol-haÉares ( Genesis 7:3 ; 8:9 ) , clearly alludes to the first occurrence of the same phrase in the universal context of creation ( Genesis 1:29 ; cf . Genesis 1:2 for a related universal expression ) , and thus here also implies a universality of the same dimension , i.e. , the entire surface of the global mass . While the shortened term `` all the earth '' ( kol-haÉares ) by itself may have a limited meaning elsewhere when indicated by the immediate context ( see Exodus 10:5 , 15 ; Numbers 22:5 , 11 ; 1 Kings 4:34 ; 10:24 ; 2 Chronicles 36:23 ; Genesis 41:57 ) , the immediate context of the Flood story is the universal sinfulness of humankind whom God had made and created ( Genesis 6:6,7 ) to have dominion over `` all the earth '' ( Genesis 1:26 ) , and the succeeding context is the universal dispersal of man after the Tower of Babel `` upon the face of all the earth '' ( Genesis 11:4 , 8 , 9 ) . In each of the four occurrences of the phrase `` upon the face of all the earth '' in Genesis outside the Flood story ( Genesis 1:29 ; 11:4 , 8 , 9 ) , it clearly has the universal sense of the entire land surface of the globe , and there is nothing in the Flood narrative to indicate any less universality . ( It should be also noted that the one place in Genesis where in context a similar phrase `` upon all the face of the earth '' is not universal [ the famine mentioned in Genesis 41:56 ] , the Hebrew has a change in word order from elsewhere in Genesis [ Ìal-kol penê haÉares ] ) . Third , the phrase `` face of the ground '' penê haÉadamah ( five times in the Flood narrative , 7:4 , 22 , 23 ; 8:8 , 13 ) , occurs in parallel with universal terms we have just noted , `` the earth '' ( 7:23 ) and `` face of all the earth '' ( 8:9 ) ; and this phrase `` face of the ground '' likewise harks back to its first usage in the universal context of creation ( Genesis 2:6 ) . Fourth , the term kol-basar `` all flesh '' occurs 12 times in Genesis 6-9 ( Genesis 6:12 , 13 , 17 , 19 ; 7:16 , 21 ; 8:17 ; 9:11 , 15 , 16 , 17 ) . The word kol `` all '' ( which can occasionally express less than totality if the context demands ) , before an indeterminate noun with no article or possessive suffix , as here in Genesis 6-9 , indicates totality . God 's announcement to destroy `` all flesh '' ( Genesis 6:13 , 17 ) and the narrator 's comment that `` all flesh '' died ( Genesis 7:21-22 ) , except the inhabitants of the ark , indicates universal destruction . The one occurrence of kol plus the determinate noun ha basar `` all the flesh '' ( in Genesis 7:15 ) likewise indicates totality as well as unity . Fifth , the expression `` every living thing '' ( kol-hahay ) of all flesh ( Genesis 6:19 ) , is another expression of totality ; in 7:4 , 23 , the similar term kol-hayeqûm means literally , `` all existence . '' This term is given further universal dimensions by the addition of the clause harking back to creation  `` all existence that I have made '' ( 7:4 )  and by the exclusive statement `` Only Noah and those who were with him in the ark remained alive '' ( 7:23 ) . As Hasel puts it : There is hardly any stronger way in Hebrew to emphasize total destruction of 'all existence ' of human and animal life on earth than the way it has been expressed . The writer of the Genesis Flood story employed terminology , formulae , and syntactical structures of the type that could not be more emphatic and explicit in expressing his concept of a universal , world-wide flood ( Hasel 1975 , p 86 ) . Sixth , the phrase `` under the whole heaven '' ( tahat kol-haamayim , Genesis 7:19 ) , is used six times in the OT outside of the Flood narrative , and always with a universal meaning ( see Deuteronomy 2:25 ; 4:19 ; Job 28:24 ; 37:3 ; 41:11 ; Daniel 9:12 ) . For example , the phrase is used to describe God 's omniscience : `` For He looks to the ends of the earth and sees under the whole heavens '' ( Job 28:24 ) . Again , it depicts God 's sovereignty : `` Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine '' ( Job 41:11 KJV ) . ( Note that the usage in Deuteronomy 2:25 , describing `` the nations under the whole heaven , '' is further qualified and limited by the phrase `` who shall hear the report of you , '' and thus is potentially universal and not an exception to the universal sense . ) The universal phrase `` under the whole heaven '' or `` under all the heavens '' also universalizes the phrase `` under heaven '' ( Genesis 6:17 ) in this same Flood context . The word `` heaven '' alone can have a local meaning [ e.g. , 1 Kings 18:45 ] , but here the context is clearly universal . Ecclesiastes , which contains numerous allusions to creation , likewise utilizes the term `` under heaven '' with a universal intention ( Ecclesiastes 1:13 ; 2:3 ; 3:1 ; cf . the parallel universal expression `` under the sun '' in Ecclesiastes 1:3 , 9 ; 2:11 , 17 ; etc . ) . In the Flood account this phrase `` under the whole heaven '' is part of two forceful verses describing the extent of the Flood : `` and the waters prevailed so mightily upon the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered . The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward , and the mountains were covered '' ( 7:19 , 20 ) . Critical scholar John Skinner notes that 7:19 , 20 `` not only asserts its [ the flood 's ] universality , but so to speak proves it , by giving the exact height of the waters above the highest mountains '' ( Skinner 1930/1956 , p 165 ) . The biblical language here simply can not be explained in terms of a local sky , and certainly can not refer to the local mountains being covered by snow , as some proponents of a local flood suggest . H.C. Leupold points out that the writer of vs. 19 is not content with a single use of kol ( `` all '' ) in `` all the high mountains , '' but `` since 'all ' is known to be used in a relative sense , the writer removes all possible ambiguity by adding the phrase 'under all the heavens . ' A double 'all ' ( kol ) can not allow for so relative a sense . It almost constitutes a Hebrew superlative . So we believe that the text disposes of the question of the universality of the Flood '' ( Leupold 1942 , p 301-302 ) . Seventh , Hasel devoted an entire scholarly article to the phrase `` all the fountains [ maÌyenoth ] of the Great Deep [ tehôm rabbah ] '' ( Genesis 7:11 ; 8:2 ) , and showed how it is linked with the universal `` Deep '' ( tehôm ) or world-ocean in Genesis 1:2 ( cf . Psalm 104:6 : `` Thou didst cover it [ the earth ] with deep [ tehôm ] as with a garment ; the waters were standing above the mountains '' ) . The `` breaking up '' and `` bursting forth '' ( i.e. , geological faulting ) of not just one subterranean water spring in Mesopotamia , but of all the `` fountains '' of the Great Deep , coupled in the same verse with the opening of the windows of the heavens , far transcends a local scene . Hasel perceptively concludes that `` the bursting forth of the waters from the fountains of the 'great deep ' refers to the splitting open of springs of subterranean waters with such might and force that together with the torrential downpouring of waters stored in the atmospheric heavens a worldwide flood comes about '' ( Hasel 1974 , p 71 ) . Eighth , in another article , Hasel ( 1978 ) shows how the Hebrew Bible reserved a special term mabbûl which in its 13 occurrences refers exclusively to the universal Genesis Flood ( 12 occurrences in Genesis , once in Psalm 29 : 10 ) . This word may be derived from the Hebrew root ybl `` to flow , to stream . '' The term mabbûl , which in the Flood narrative is usually associated with mayim `` waters , '' seems to have become `` a technical term for waters flowing or streaming forth and as such designates the flood ( deluge ) being caused by waters . ... mabbûl is in the Old Testament a term consistently employed for the flood ( deluge ) which was caused by torrential rains and the bursting forth of subterranean waters '' ( Hasel 1978 , p 92-93 ) . This technical term clearly sets the Genesis Deluge apart from all local floods , and is utilized in the Psalm 29:10 to illustrate Yahweh 's universal sovereignty over the world at the time of the Noahic Flood : `` The Lord sat enthroned at the Flood , and the Lord sits as King forever . '' Summarizing regarding the technical terminology used for the extent of the Flood in Genesis 6-9 , Hasel writes : The Genesis flood narrative provides ample evidence of being an account which is to be understood as a historical narrative in prose style . It expects to be taken literally . There is a consistent and overwhelming amount of terminology and formulae ... which on the basis of context and syntax has uniformly indicated that the flood story wants to be understood in a universal sense : the waters destroyed all human and animal plus bird life on the entire land mass of the globe . To read it otherwise means to force a meaning on the carefully written and specific syntactical constructions of the original language which the text itself rejects ( Hasel 1975 , p 87 ) . III . Other Biblical Evidence for a Universal Flood Many additional lines of biblical evidence converge in affirming the universal extent of the Flood and also reveal the theological significance of this conclusion . We will summarize fourteen points that emerge from the biblical text . First , the trajectory of major themes in Genesis 1-11  Creation , Fall , plan of redemption , spread of sin  is universal in scope and calls for a corresponding universal judgment . We have already noted in reference to specific Flood terminology the numerous allusions to the universal context of creation . The creation of `` the heavens and the earth '' certainly is not local in scope according to Genesis 1-2 . Likewise , the Fall of humanity in Adam and Eve led to the sinful condition of the entire human race ( haÉdam ) , not just the inhabitants of Mesopotamia ( see Genesis 6:5 , 11 ; Romans 3:19 ; 5:12 ) . Again , the Protoevangelium ( first Gospel promise ) outlined in Genesis 3:15 , involves the universal moral struggle between the spiritual descendants ( or `` seed '' ) of the serpent and the spiritual descendants ( `` seed '' ) of the woman , culminating in the victory of the representative Messianic Seed over the serpent ( see Robertson 1980 ) . This plan of redemption is certainly universal in scope . In a similar way , the sinful condition of humankind described at the time of the Flood includes more than those living in the Fertile Crescent . From God 's perspective , not simply from the culturally conditioned local view of the narrator , we have the results of the divine investigative judgment : `` And God saw that the wickedness of man ( haÉdam , humankind ) was great in the earth , and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually '' ( Genesis 6:5 ) . Such universal sinfulness naturally calls for universal judgment . Second , the divine purpose given for the bringing of the Flood makes explicit its universal scope : `` And the Lord said , 'I will destroy man [ ( haÉdam ) , humanity ] whom I have created from the face of the earth ; both man , and beast , creeping things and birds of the air , for I am sorry that I have made them '' ( Genesis 6:7 ) . Nothing less than a complete destruction of the human race ( except for Noah , 6:8 ) seems envisaged . Given the length of time from creation ( over 1650 years minimum ) , the longevity of the antediluvians ( nearly a thousand years ) , and God 's command at creation to `` fill the earth '' ( Genesis 1:28 ) , it is highly unlikely that the pre-Flood population would have stayed only in Mesopotamia . Thus the destruction of humanity would necessitate more than a local Flood . Third , the genealogical lines from both Adam ( Genesis 4:17-26 ; 5:1-31 ) and Noah ( Genesis 10:1-32 ; 11:1-9 ) are exclusive in nature , indicating that as Adam was father of all pre-Flood humanity , so Noah was father of all post-Flood humanity . From the descendants of Noah `` the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood '' ( Genesis 10 : 32 ) , and the Tower of Babel experience spreads humanity across the globe ( Genesis 11:1-19 ) . Striking extra-biblical evidence that all human races , and not just the nations of the Fertile Crescent , are included in the descendants of Noah , and retain memory of the universal Flood , is found in the amazing prevalence of ancient flood stories throughout the world . Over 230 different flood stories are known and occur among the most diverse peoples of the earth ( see Frazer 1918 , 1:105-361 ; Nelson 1931 ) . A world-wide flood is by far the most frequently-given cause for past universally destructive calamities in the folk literature of antiquity ( Thompson 1955 , 1:182-194 ) . A remarkable number of these oral and written traditions agree upon the basic points of the biblical account : all humankind was destroyed by a great flood as a result of divine judgment against human sin , and a single man and his family or a few friends survived the deluge in a ship or other sea-faring vessel . The stories nearest to the area of the Dispersion at Babel are the closest in detail to the biblical account ( see Heidel 1946 , Jacobsen 1981 , and Lambert and Millard 1969 ) . This vast body of ancient witnesses to a world-wide Deluge is powerful testimony to the historicity and universality of the biblical Flood . Fourth , the same inclusive divine blessing to be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth is given to both Adam and Noah ( Genesis 1:28 ; 9:1 ) . This is another linkage between universal creation and the flood , between the original beginning and the `` new beginning . '' As the human race at creation flows from Adam and Eve , so the postdiluvial humanity is populated through Noah . Fifth , the covenant ( Genesis 9:9-10 ) with its rainbow sign ( Genesis 9:12-17 ) is clearly linked to the extent of the Flood , and includes the whole earth ( Genesis 9:13-17 ) . If there was only a local flood , then the covenant would be only a limited covenant , and the rainbow sign of `` the all-embracing universality of the Divine mercy '' ( Delitzsch 1888/1976 , 1:289-290 ) would be stripped of its meaning . Sixth , the viability of God 's promise ( Genesis 9:15 ; cf . Isaiah 54:9 ) and the integrity of God in keeping His promise is wrapped up in the world-wide extent of the Flood . This point can not be underscored too heavily : if Genesis 6-9 describes only a local flood , then God has broken His promise every time another local flood has happened ! The only way God 's promise not to send another flood to destroy every living thing ( Genesis 8:21 ) can be seen to have been kept is if the Flood was a universal one and the whole human race outside the ark was destroyed . Seventh , the universality of the Flood is underscored by the enormous size of the ark detailed in Genesis 6:14-15 and the stated necessity for saving all the kinds of animals and plants in the ark ( Genesis 6:16-21 ; 7:2-3 ) . A massive ark filled with representatives of all non-aquatic animal/plant kinds would be unnecessary if this were only a local flood , for these kinds could have been preserved elsewhere in the world . Yet the divine insistence in the biblical record is that the animals were brought into the ark to preserve representatives of all of the various kinds ( Genesis 6:19-20 ) . As a matter of fact , if only a local flood were in view , the building of any ark at all , even for Noah and his family , would have been superfluous  God could simply have warned Noah and his family in time to escape from the coming judgment , just as he did with Lot in Sodom . But the point of the narrative concerning the ark is that there was no other escape ; in the midst of the Flood `` only Noah and those who were with him in the ark remained '' ( Genesis 7:23 ) . Eighth , the covering of `` all the high mountains '' by at least 15 cubits ( Genesis 7:19-20 ) could not involve simply a local flood , since water seeks its own level across the surface of the globe . Even one high mountain covered in a local Mesopotamian setting would require that same height of water everywhere on the planet 's surface . In this connection we note that it is not necessary to postulate the existence of mountains as high as Mt . Everest at the time of the Flood , and thus to require waters covering the earth to a depth of six miles , as some proponents of a local flood suggest would be necessary ( see Ramm 1954 , p 242 ) . The antediluvian mountains were very possibly much lower than at present . Passages in the book of Job and Psalms may well be referring to the process of postdiluvian mountain uplift ( see Job 9:5 ; 28:9 ; and Psalm 104:7-8 ) . Also in this connection we may address the objection that proponents of a local flood often raise , namely , that a world-wide Flood would imply `` that the earth 's surface was completely renovated during the flood year '' and thus `` prediluvian topography would have been exceedingly different from postdiluvian topography . '' This implication , they claim , is in conflict with biblical evidence which `` strongly suggests that prediluvian geography did basically resemble postdiluvian geography '' ( Young 1977 , p 210 ) . Reference is made particularly to the topographical descriptions in connection with the Garden of Eden : the lands of Havilah and Cush , and the four rivers , two of which ( the Tigris and the Euphrates ) were familiar to the readers of Genesis in Moses ' time . What is not recognized in these arguments , however , is that although there are some similarities between the prediluvian and postdiluvian topography , there are more differences than similarities . Two of the rivers mentioned apparently no longer existed in Moses ' time : the Pishon and Gihon are mentioned in terms of where they used to flow , in the postdiluvian areas of Havilah and Cush respectively . The other two rivers  the Tigris and Euphrates  are described as coming from a common source in the Garden of Eden , certainly far different from their present courses . Thus the topographical descriptions in the early chapters of Genesis are in harmony with a world-wide Flood . Also , it is likely that survivors of the Flood would use familiar names for topographical features after the Flood , even though the earth 's surface looked entirely different . Ninth , the duration of the Flood makes sense only with a universal flood . The Deluge of rain from above and water from the fountains of the deep below continued 40 days ( Genesis 7:17 ) , and all the highest mountains were still covered five months after the Flood began ; the tops of the mountains were not seen until after seven months , and the Flood waters were not dried up enough for Noah to leave the ark until one year and ten days had passed ( see Genesis 7:11 ; 8:14 ) . Such lengths of time seem commensurate only with a universal and not a local flood . Tenth , the receding activity of the water ( Genesis 8:3a , 54a ) is described by Hebrew phrases which , in parallel with similar phraseology and grammatical construction for the `` to and fro '' motion of the raven ( Genesis 8:7 ) , should be translated as `` going and retreating , '' ( see Austin 1990 , p 218 ; Hasel 1978 , p 93 ) and imply oscillatory water motion lasting for 74 days ( see Genesis 8:3-5 ) . The waters rushing back and forth like in ocean tidal movement as the overall level gradually decreased , supports a universal interpretation such as `` the oceanic energy impulse model of the flood '' ( Austin 1990 , p 218 ) , but is incongruous with a local flood theory . Eleventh , the NT passages concerning the Flood all employ universal language : `` swept them all away '' ( Matthew 24:39 ) ; `` destroyed them all , '' ( Luke 17:27 ) ; `` he did not spare the ancient world , but preserved Noah with seven other persons , ... when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly '' ( 2 Peter 2:5 ) ; `` a few , that is eight persons , were saved through water '' ( 1 Peter 3:20 ) ; Noah `` condemned the world '' ( Hebrews 11:7 ) . A local flood would not have ended the antediluvian world . As Archer states , `` we have the unequivocal corroboration of the New Testament that the destruction of the human race at the time of the flood was total and universal '' ( Archer 1985 , p 208 ) . Twelfth , the NT Flood typology assumes and depends upon not only the historicity , but also the universality , of the Flood to theologically argue for an imminent world-wide judgment by fire ( 2 Peter 3:6-7 ) . Peter argues that just as there was a world-wide judgment by water causing the unbelieving antediluvian world to perish , so in the antitype there must-needs-be a universal end-time judgment by fire bringing about the destruction of the ungodly ( see Davidson 1981 , p 326-327 ) . Thirteenth , key terms and motifs that we have already noted in Genesis 6-9 converge to make a major theological statement : the Noahic Flood is nothing less than the cosmic undoing or reversal of creation . Numerous biblical scholars have recognized this highly significant theological point of the Flood narrative . Nahum Sarna writes that `` The Flood is a cosmic catastrophe that is actually the undoing of creation . '' In other words , creation is being undone , and the world returned to chaos ( Sarna 1989 , p 48 ) . Tikva Frymer-Kensky describes the Flood as `` the original , cosmic undoing of creation '' ( Frymer-Kensky 1983 , p 410 ; cf . Frymer-Kensky 1985 , p 312 ) . Claus Westermann speaks of the `` invasion of chaos into the created order ; the flood assumed cosmic proportions '' ( Westermann 1974/1984 , p 434 ) . Umberto Cassuto points out that at the high point of the Flood , `` We see water everywhere , as though the world had reverted to its primeval state at the dawn of Creation , when the waters of the Deep submerged everything '' ( Cassuto 1964 , p 97 ) . David Clines uses the apt term bouleversement or `` reversal '' of creation to depict the theological significance of the Flood ( Clines 1972 , p 136 ) . For Joseph Blenkinsopp , ... the deluge is an act of uncreation , undoing the work of separation by returning everything to the primeval , watery chaos from which the created order first arose ( Blenkinsopp 1992 , p 83 ; cf . Blenkinsopp 1971 , p 46-47 ) . Gerhard von Rad vividly underscores the universal implications of this undoing or reversal of creation : ... we must understand the Flood , therefore , as a catastrophe involving the entire cosmos . When the heavenly ocean breaks forth upon the earth below , and the primeval sea beneath the earth , which is restrained by God , now freed from its bonds , gushes up through yawning chasms onto the earth , then there is a destruction of the entire cosmic system according to biblical cosmology . The two halves of the chaotic primeval sea , separated  the one up , the other below  by God 's creative government ( ch . 1:7-9 ) , are again united ; creation begins to sink into chaos . Here the catastrophe , therefore , concerns not only men and beasts ... but the earth ( chs . 6.13 ; 9.1 )  indeed , the entire cosmos ( von Rad 1972 , p 128 ) . Only a cosmic/universal Flood can theologically encompass the cosmic/universal reversal or undoing of creation described in Genesis 6-9 . Fourteenth and last , the cosmic reversal of creation is followed by a cosmic New Beginning . As Clines states it : ... the 'uncreation ' which God has worked with the Flood is not final ; creation has not been permanently undone . Old unities of the natural world are restored ( 8:22 ) , and the old ordinances of creation are renewed ( 9:1-7 ) ( Clines 1972-73 , p 138 ) . Jacques Doukhan has shown the precise literary parallels between the successive stages of `` re-creation '' in the aftermath of the Flood ( Genesis 8-9 ) and the seven days of creation in Genesis 1-2 ( Doukhan 1987 , p 133-134 ; cf . Gage 1984 , p 10-20 ) : The wind over the earth and waters . Gen. 8:1 ; cf . Gen. 1:2 . Division of waters . Gen. 8:1-5 ; cf . Gen. 1:6-8 . Appearance of plants . Gen. 8:6-12 ; cf . Gen. 1:9-13 . Appearance of light . Gen. 8:13-14 ; cf . Gen. 1:14-19 . Deliverance of animals . Gen. 8:15-17 ; cf . Gen. 1:20-23 . Animals together with men , blessing , food for men , image of God . Gen. 8:18-9:7 ; cf . Gen. 1:24-31 . Sign of covenant . Gen. 9:8-17 ; cf . Gen. 2:1-3 . Thus in the over-arching literary structure of the `` re-creation '' in the Flood narrative , the universal dimension of the Flood is underscored by detailed parallels with the cosmic creation account of Genesis 1-2 . IV . Conclusion In conclusion , the question of the extent of the Genesis Flood is not just a matter of idle curiosity with little at stake for Christian faith . For those who see the days of creation in Genesis 1 as six , literal 24-hour days ( see Hasel 1994 ) , a universal Flood is an absolute necessity to explain the existence of the geologic column . A literal creation week is inextricably linked with a world-wide flood . But a universal Flood is crucial not only in seeking to reconcile science and Scripture . It is also pivotal in understanding and remaining faithful to the theology of Genesis 1-11 and the rest of Scripture . ( For a more detailed discussion of the theology of the Genesis Flood in its canonical context , see Davidson in press . ) The many links with the universal creation in Genesis 1-2 which we have noted in this study not only support the aspect of universality in the Flood , but serve to theologically connect Protology ( Creation ) and Eschatology ( Judgment/Salvation ) in the opening chapters of Scripture . The Flood is an eschatological step-by-step `` uncreation '' of the world and humanity followed by a step-by-step `` re-creation '' of the new world . `` Thus , '' writes von Rad , `` the story of the Flood  and this is theologically the most important fact  shows an eschatological world judgment ... . The world judgment of the Flood hangs like an iron curtain between this world age and that of the first splendor of creation '' ( von Rad 1972 , p 129-130 ) . The theology of the universal Flood is therefore the pivot of a connected but multi-faceted universal theme running through Genesis 1-11 and constituting an over-arching pattern for the entire subsequent world-wide creation revealing the character of the Creator and His original purpose for creation ; humankind 's turning from the Creator and the universal spread of sin ending in the universal `` uncreation '' through eschatological judgment ; and re-creation , in the eschatological salvation of the faithful covenant remnant and the universal renewal of the earth .
No , but some intelligence should be exercised when going to a court of law . For example , the choice of the board on WHO to represent them . Do you think that the judge will be able to totally dismiss in his mind that this group mission is to push a religious agenda ?
Actually it does . Gangbangers and other criminals are n't allowed to possess firearms . Having an unregistered firearm is illegal in California . You need a license to own a handgun in California . Transporting an uncased , loaded firearm in California is a crime . Carrying a concealed weapon without a nearly impossible to get permit is a crime . Open carry of a loaded weapon is a crime . If the governor does n't show some backbone then soon the open carry of an unloaded firearm will also be a crime . All of these acts are crimes . Plenty for the police to arrest the people doing the drive by shootings , plenty of offenses to file charges on . The police have all the tools they 'd need for keeping the people of California safe , and yet California still has the highest number of drive by shootings in the entire nation . Wise up . Gun control laws are doing nothing to protect anyone . And if they were helping take `` guns off the streets '' and `` out of the hands of the bad guys '' then this high number would n't have happened .
Really . For that reason , we , antiabortion atheists , hold that abortionist are really religious nuts who believe that a soul exists and penetrates into a body along with the first air breathing . Chester :
It 's an odd article for Telegraph , though I have n't noticed this Bob Carter bloke before . It contradicts almost all the environmental stories they 've done before and comes with an unwelcome seam of personal opinion in the article . If anything it sounds like some of the stuff you hear from the US denying the existance of Global Warming . Jo , I know you do n't read the Telegraph but you are way off regarding the normal content .
I do n't get you here .
A SWAT officer , a member of the `` best of the best '' team as far as police forces go , left a weapon behind where it could 've been snatched up by any two bit criminal and used on a crime spree as people were mowed down by true automatic firepower . Those of you who believe that only the military and police should have guns , you just got a kick in the teeth from this incident occurring . So quit ragging on private citizens who are n't `` perfect '' as far as you 're concerned .
Oh yeah right , like sociopaths who are bent on killing and slaughtering everyone around them , can be fixed with something as stupid as school counseling .
Then none of them are pro-life . To be pro-life means you respect the right to life for the fetus . You cant just pick and choose when abortion is right .
So why should merchant ships be required to go unarmed and defenseless in dangerous areas ?
Really ? I do n't see myself in trouble for saying them . I stand by them , for they are truthful words .
The anti-abortionists claim that would be killing a human life to save one .
That 's stupid ( and totally inaccurate ) . But I will say one thing - I would make partial birth abortion a federal crime with the death penalty for whoever performs one . And I 'd make their executions public and put them on pay TV , and use the proceeds to fund homes for unwed mothers , etc . Those late-term abortion butchers are the most despicable individuals known to mankind , and they deserve what they get .
Actually , selection occurs by differential reproductive rates . What this means is that organisms which reproduce more will have more offspring than the others ( obviously ) . Therefore , traits that help organisms reproduce will become more prevailant .
But then you are as your post indicates .
Really ? Then why did you start off your little rant by admitting that `` ... microevolution can not be reasonably disputed . '' Evolution has been observed , and that is a fact . Speciation in both plants and animals has been observed , and that is a fact . Apparently you do n't know what a theory is . Might it not be wise to learn just a little about science before you make yourself look so foolish ? Theories explain facts .
The absolute truth is that for many of us evolution explains the diversity of life we see all around us better than `` poof '' ever did .
Well let me tell you what Thomas Jefferson thinks of your pro gay sin folly : `` Whosoever shall be guilty of Rape , Polygamy , or Sodomy with man or woman shall be punished , if a man , by castration , if a woman , by cutting thro ' the cartilage of her nose a hole of one half inch diameter at the least . '' - Thomas Jefferson Amendment VIII : Thomas Jefferson , A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments Sodomy was outlawed in every state of the Union at one time . But now that homosexual sinners are coming out of their closets like the brazen hedonists that they are , we 're regressing back to Sodom and Gomorrah values . Americans reject gay marriage . It 's a perversion and an abomination .
That does n't sound silly to me .
And SS is once again wrong . If you really believe that then try to tell your genes to give you tiger stripes which will be inherited by your children . Good luck .
And again , a creationist shows the belief that if you do n't agree with them , you 're an atheist .
You 'll find that abortion targets none of these : `` national , ethnical , racial or religious group ( s ) . '' Unwanted , unborn children is not a specific group . Nor are members of any group specifically targeted for abortion . The practice in open to all in the US . Sorry . But all that shows is an abundant level of ignorance . Now , if you can show that abortion is only used to cull the Romany populations in East Europe ... then you may have a point .
By the way , that video , among others is obviously satire on literal creationists . Edward Current has been running around making satirical videos on creationists and theists . The funny thing is , you ca n't figure out it 's satire . What is even funnier is that you appear to think that the arguments Edward Current gives are actually good and prove that atheists are deluded . He uses so many fallacies including circular reasoning and you ca n't seem to notice that those methods of argumentation are extremely poor . But then again , you seem to think that Co2 is the primary input gas for ATP production rather then O2 ... . I 'm still waiting for your equations proving that ATP production is massively higher with Co2 rather then O2 .
Forest for the freakin ' trees . So when heterosexual couples divorce , it 's all automatic and assumed . Gay and straight people alike help foot the bill . Straight couples `` have abso-freaking-lutely no qualms about forcing Mr. and Mrs. John Q . Taxpayer to pony up more dough '' ... But when it comes to homosexual couples divorcing , it 's only the gay individuals who `` shell out more $ $ $ '' . Can you explain why it 's just for gays to help pay for the divorce of straight couples , but the same is not done for gays ? ? ?
Wrong , France 's form of government is a semi-presidential republic , with rather democratic leanings . They do however tax the rich at a very high rate , up to 70 % . This has caused the rich to leave France , taking their money , buinesses , and thousands of jobs with them . Starting in 2007 , France began lowering/ eliminating wealth taxes in an effort to draw those people and companies back to France . They have seen the error of their ways and are trying to do something about it .
Why the cheap shot against pp ?
Oh it applies , but if we were to look at the Bible that way , God would n't allow one single bad thing to happen .
Natural selection does not refine or do anything for that matter . If you feel it is evidence of something that does nothing , no worries .
I 'm surprised your belief rests on such a fragile concept ... . for me that would be like the sword of Damocles forever hanging over my faith . A couple of technical points : there are no rocks that contain organic matter and are 4500 years old . Compacted sediments maybe . Also , where do you get the idea that carbon 14 dating is only accurate to 4500 years old ?
I 've found a way to avoid gun accidents in my home .
Well then who do I have to call ? I 'd like to report Brady for being in possession of 13,000 rounds of restricted armor piercing ammunition and 100 guns , most of which have been illegally modified for full-auto firing capabilities , as well as an uncounted number of IEDs . The link does n't work , BTW .
What quaint illogic . Only people who marry can get divorced , so a reduction in people marrying has no effect on rising divorce rates . If anything , a rising divorce rate among fewer marriages points to an even higher divorce rate than `` normal '' .
Since I do n't believe believe that everything had a common ancestor , a rock , I consider all ancient reptiles dinosaurs . If that is incorrect in your book so be it . We are not debating the definition of dinosaurs .
We already accept that it is . You do n't have to convince us . However , consider what this does to your argument that natural selection is random .
I think you might want to check your logic here ... As far as I am aware , drug addicts cause a great deal of crime to support their habit . As you are , I am not terribly fond of policing someone 's personal habits , but when drugs are the motivating force behind burglaries , assaults and muggings and addicts carry diseases such AIDS and tuberculosis then means of curtailing this should be explored . This may include policing or controlling the supply of drugs to an area to cut down and the amount of drugs sold , and thus less crime to support fewer habits . Easy access to drugs is , logically , part of the problem .
Thats a rather shaky argument . In some place felons do vote . Our own fast eddie has them getting signed up while in prison . If you take a right and question it , then it is no longer a right . It has become a defacto privilige . If it was up to me , criminals would have their own sanctuary away from the law abiding after they serve their time .
Oh look , a lie . Imagine my surprise . Truth : Scientists have extrapolated that the universe expanded from an incredibly dense mass . The Big Bang theory does not posit that this mass `` popped '' into existence ; in fact , we have no idea what happened less than 10^-43 seconds after expansion began . It is a common interpretation that there was no time `` before '' the mass existed , therefore the first law of thermodynamics was not violated .
Better is worse ? See above .
And where exactly did you hear this ? I find it hard to believe a governent that could n't keep an affair or a low-level break-in under wraps could keep something like that secret ... ... ... ... ... .. Also if it is true and among alliance forces why do you blame solely the US ?
they may respect life but what about respecting the quality of life ? if they cared about their children 's future they would not breed like rabbits . It is callous to use their children to win the 'numbers game ' quality before quantity . I do n't deny that abortion is murder in the womb though .
Is this a debate over the accuracy of the Genesis creation story or just a debate over the general idea that God did in fact create the world and it 's inhabitants ?
My recollection is similar to yours . I encountered it in an AP biology class in high school , we spent about 1/2 the extra-long class in labs ( I think that was the primary difference ) . The giraffe example was an `` aha '' moment for me personally , I suspected life changed , but the specifics I had never thought about . I recall a disclaimer at the start of the section , but I do n't recall the exact wording . -Mach
Abortion targets a very specific group of human beings : unwanted , unborn children . Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide . The Convention defined genocide as any of a series of acts designed to `` destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group . '' The acts listed include among others , causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group , imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group or forcibly transferring children out of the group .
Not really .
As above
I agree . The terms used should be more accurate , such as ; Pro-Choice and Pro-Control
I will stop quoting here . Do n't want people to have too big a read . Actually ToE is n't all that random . To a certain degree yes . But Sexual Selection aka a part of the ToE . Dictates that when there is a benificial/attractive change . That change will be enhanced almost exponentially . Because the female of the species will be programmed to search for that and will carry the gene herself so will give it to her off spring . And the male will be more succesfull so produce more off spring . So no instant eyes or anything like that . I think that 's what you were implying . Sorry for responding in Kronus 's stead . I 'm sure he can defend himself but I found it unjust the way you replied to his post and attacked it on foundations that you did n't have .
Jesus was a retarded ancient hippie who walked passed people who were starving and dying , yet did n't help them . Jesus is a man who ignored his family and considered his disciples family instead . Jesus is a man who did n't come to preach peace , but use a sword . Jesus is a man who did n't repudiate much of the Old Testament atrocities . Jesus is bad , and Jesus is GOd , therefore God is bad . I do n't care what the biblical stoner said .
Well as long as you ignore the evidence , why do you need proof . Blind faith works just fine .
False . See above .
What you quoted is what Answers in Genesis said . Please do not be dishonest and tell others that I said this as I did not .
Not at all , more stories that have been fed to you . The notion of a literal Genesis was rejected two hundred years ago , when no evidence of it could be found . the leading scientists of the day were often also trained in divinity , so they were looking HARD for it . But they had the integrity to admit that it was n't there .
Since you bring it up , I do think that you are a nut . But your site is even nuttier . Not one shred of evidence that I found - just assertion . Moreover , the author does n't seem to know the difference between an hypothesis and a theory .
Almighty nature ? You mean you believe in the universe ? Welceom to the club . I think we can all agree we 're part of the universe . Except for skeptics , they delude themsleves into thinking they can not know ( which they claim to know ) . -Mach
Intelligent design comes in many flavors too . ID that submits as a designer something that has any quality of the unknowable is irrational . ID that submits we were created/designed by things inside the universe that are knowable are rational claims . However , they have no evidence , so they have a long way to go to be shown to be worthwhile to pursue . Even a simple application of Occam 's razor tells us that to suspect a thousand theories on how life has changed on earth is unecessary when another theory can fulfill the description entirely , of life , and they have evidence to support it . It 's why this theory is discarded onto the heap of any number of theories that simply is n't going anywhere . You can make up a theory right now about how life began , but if it can not be supported by evidence or is redundant to a theory already described ... why would we ?

It 's a flawed step in the right direction . I support it compared to nothing . I did not support it when they were considering CUs vs. full marriage . They took the politically expedient way out . Lest you leap to any unwarranted conclusions , my main objection is the blatent inequality inhererent in CUs .
I note that you consider yourself irrational , though I could not possibly comment . There are times that I am grateful that your parents chose to live on the wrong side of the Atlantic , but then I allow for your need to identify with your adopted home and reject the motherland .

Really ? I have n't seen you post your support for any law or proposal that would punish criminals in the most severe ways possible . All I 've ever seen you post support for is more laws that criminalize things that are n't crimes and do nothing to harm others .
By measuring it 's effect .
I see . Sounds too nebulous to stand up to scrutiny in the US . I 'm guessing that the SCOTUS would strike down such as law as being too vague .
I 'd be pretty dumb to buy something from someone who does n't even believe in what they 're selling . Those teachers may teach it , but they do n't believe in it .
which is pretty much the same thing . The majority of representatives get their way . The representatives are elected by a majority . Being overally picky about it gets you no where ... we pretty much have a majority rules nation . And we still have n't settled the question about how you think you can impose your belief on others but I ca n't . The `` convention '' idea did n't work , the idea that you are n't imposing a belief on others did n't work , so what is next ?
Or another example of how denying homosexuals access access to anything but the same legal institutions as heterosexuals will never result in equality . The domestic partner registry just is n't sufficient ; why would anyone think that creating a similar marriage-substitute will be equal ?
Very nicely stated in an editorial in today 's New York Times : http : //www.nytimes.com/2009/01/24/opinion/24sat3.html At last . Real people matter . Not tiresome maxims of blind , unquestioning faith .
If the biblical lesson one is intended to take from the story of Sodom and Gomorrah were applied to a bath house or any service business it would eventually go BK . The two cities were not condemned because of rampant homosexual activities , you of course know this , it has been explained to you , it has been shown to you , but when you want to be right nothing else matters . Why is it that modern Christians have an undeniable obsession regarding homosexuals ? Jesus obviously did n't consider it worth mentioning , but he did have a problem with divorce . Yet that is a protected right . The Holy Mother Church will disobey Jesus and grant divorce , but holds on tight to another misinterpretation . The blind leading the blind in blissful ignorance . How pist will you be having to spend some time in the pit because of something like this ? Oh and unwarranted hatred while not specifically stated as a sin undermines society faster with more tangible and lasting effects than if you just got over it . Hey maybe if you ignore them they will go away . Try it and see if it works .
Great story . Thanks .
And THAT 'S why we have these things called judges - so they can rule such things to be unconstitutional . And yet , for some reason , you and your fellow anti-gay people are always complaining about judges doing just that .
I know what you mean . You should see some of the other `` books '' he has at his site as well . Well , now we know that Muslim creationists are even nuttier than Christian creationists , but both still use the same twisted ideas and concepts to justify their pseudo-science of creationism ( Read : Religious beliefs ) .
Here , the atheist satirists assign perfection to astronomers . They have no comprehension of God being above and beyond time , and this causes them to feel that theyre on the same level as God , able to question him and challenge him to the same extent he can question us and challenge us . Yet they know that there are characteristics of reality that they themselves can not explain , though they probably seriously believe that astronomy is an exact , non-controversial science .
Yes , it is against the law in most states to do that .
Atheism is for cynical , self-righteous twits

Well feel free to disprove evolution anytime .
That happens , too . For example , our gene for vitamin C is broken and no longer works .
But you are the accuser . I 've read the Bible and I have studied religion , more than you can imagine . I have also studied biology , performed experiments and reached conclusions . The problem is that you seem unable to think for yourself .
I linked to a post that sufficiently validates my point . If you want to discuss in more detail the broader implications of current abortion policy , I would be happy to do so . We can start with your suggestion that abortions are illegal after the first trimester . That suggestion , while common , is not correct . 12 % of abortions in the United States occur after the first trimester of pregnancy . That 's an estimated total of about 154,800 abortions in 2002 . And besides that , you miss the point . The point I tried to advance is that people who are avidly pro-choice typically do not see any circumstances under which they would restrict abortions save for ( in some instances ) the third trimester . Thus , they would defend a woman 's decision to obtain an abortion for the sole reason that she fears that the child will be one gender rather than the other . It also would be interesting to know ( since you felt the need to weight in ) whether you support abortions performed solely for the purpose of gender selection ?
The redundant 0.3GHz version was replaced by a serial 0.7GHz upgrade which ironed out most of the problems of the older model . I do n't know if anyone else had the .3 , it always used to give you the 'hibernation error at line 20 ... insert more berries ' message and then turn blue and refuse to budge . Still , the thing was with the .3 bear , you could really get under the bonnet and fiddle about . I customized mine from a European Black to a Grizzly - new fur job and everything . The .7 was essentially designed for XXXXXX . Sure it did n't crash as often but when it did there was nothing you could do but wheel it down to Bear Repairs and pay an extortionate amount for a new muzzle and a set of claws .

It 's kind of funny that they claim this happened , but ca n't get the woman to come out and say it ?
I 'm not selfish , whether you or your buddy JP like to think so or not - I just look at actual reality rather than a fantasy world . As Another_opinion hinted , another factor is the fact that until around the end of the second trimester , I do not believe that a foetus is a person - something that made the choice to abort much easier for me than it is for some women whose religions have brainwashed them to worship the holy fertilized egg .
Well , the Vatican taking a proper moral stand is so rare and note worthy .
Not at all true . They secrete mucous , they do not melt . As for the absence of some verses form various versions/editions of the bible - I have had that problem too , and not just with quotes form `` infidels . '' For example , many versions have 're-interpreted ' or re-translated ' various verses to reflect certain political views and ideologies ( which I find disgusting ) . For example , I have heard of a version that now singles out `` abortionists '' as evil-doers , and I have had a hard time tracking down online bibles that contain the actual KJV of Luke 14:26 - many have removed the word `` hate '' and replaced with a more conservatively correct `` love less '' , which is not even what the original Greek was ... So , not being able to find certain verses does not mean that they are made-up or otherwise inaccurate , it may be that various versions have altered/omitted some of them ...
OK ... first up excuse me if what I say makes no sense as I have never tried to really formulate my thoughts on this ... First up : omnipresence/omniscience/eternality : I 'm not sure omnipresence is the definitive word to use because it implies that there is something 'other ' than is 'present ' everywhere , alongside or behind every point in the universe . My POV is that 'God ' literally is the universe , every particle , every wave , every field . This certainly implies awareness of everything within the universe and all past events , but if you include knowledge of future events in the term 'omniscience ' I am not so sure ; time is another dimension like the spatial dimensions but it is very different in terms of what happens when you 'travel ' along it compared to travelling through space , so I have never been able to view 4D spacetime as literally 4 equivalent dimensions ; it is 3 space dimensions plus time . With this in mind , I am not sure that even a universal ( ie space-transcending ) consciousness would also transcend time . As for eternality , this hypothetical consciousness would only exist as long as the universe exists , and we all know the problems with that little tangle ...
Mandatory storage laws are in violation of the Second Amendment because they interfere with personal defense , by making your defensive weapon inaccessible when you need it . I do n't care if you use the justification of it only applying when you 're not at home , that 's not good enough ; trouble can follow you home and attack before you can unpack your weapon now that you 're there . Then there 's the fact that mandatory storage laws serve no crime fighting purpose . Responsible people already lock up their guns , they keep them out of the hands of children and strangers , they do n't need a law to tell them to do what they 're already doing . Such a proposal takes away responsibility , it suggests that nobody is capable of being trusted unless everything is spelled out by federal law and carries strict penalties with it . There 's also the fact that the police have better things to do than penalize people for something that is n't a crime or a threat to anyone 's safety . Who should law enforcement be targeting more , a dangerous gang with ties to the mexican mafia , or a single mom who forgot about putting her pistol in the safe before going to the grocery store ? Police resources are limited as is . I do n't see why we should be squandering what resources we have , going after people for technical violations rather than true crimes that victimize anyone and everyone .
so your claim is that the date means that your `` joke '' is based on reality ? It takes more than that .

So individual cells contract to move cytoplasm around and to transport oxygen within itself ?
No , we should n't abolish every flawed system . However , when the flaw results in putting innocent people to death , it is not worth the risk . In 26 years the death penalty has been in effect in my home state of Illinois , there have been more people exonerated due to irrefutable evidence than have been put to death . I think that constitutes a serious problem .
Because they could n't own models like the AR-15 or AK-47 ? Last I checked those were banned in Chicago and much of Illinois , limiting people to mainly deer rifles .
But , of course , religion is a mere matter of brainwashing and programming . Some people , very obviously , need this sort of intrusion into their lives because they ca n't figure it out for themselves . And , there are some very profound and meaningful religious teachings . However , if one is not permitted to question the tenets of a particular belief system , I find that dangerous . Like in your sect . You do expect complete obedience , do you not ? No questioning of your authority ?
While I do n't follow the whole `` child trap '' thing , ... whatever it is , ... Would that be any more ridiculous than the notion that a vagina is an entrance/exit to personhood ?

Actually just as many atheist help the needy . Of course a person would need to be open-minded to realize it . Here is one such atheist charity . If you were open-minded about such things then you would have learned that both Bill Gates and Warren Buffett , who have each individually made the two largest charitable donations in American history , are both atheist ( Oops , bet that 's got ta kill your argument , huh ? ) and they can rightly claim credit for spurring many other ultra-rich to also be charitable . Ted Turner , the multi-billionaire , has also donated millions to others , and guess what grizzly6626 , he 's an atheist too ! George Soros , also a multi-billionaire , financier and philanthropist , has also donated millions and is also an atheist . The list goes on and on . You just do n't hear about these people donating because they tend to do these things quietly , and not with a lot of *cough* religious *cough* fanfare . Did n't mean to wake you up grizzly6626 BTW - many catholic charities are known to turn the needy away . I 've heard many accounts about how when some people first got married back in the 1970s , that catholic charities would n't help them out because they were not `` good , church-going catholics . '' Basically because they did n't go to church every week ( and put in their money filled envelope ) the Church did n't consider them worthy of help . You see , it is n't because religion makes people morally better than atheism . Rather , it would be because churches often organize charitable activities and encourage their members to participate , while atheists , simply have no comparable social structure . It 's not that churchgoers have a superior moral sentiment , just that because of their increased social structure they naturally have increased opportunity . There are countless amounts of people who are atheist that donate from the heart . They do not 'band together ' into groups like religions do , and they do not advertise their charitable works like religions do , but they donate from the heart just the same . Here is a partial list of many such individuals who just happen to also be atheist . But it goes MUCH further than that though . There are a few organizations formed by atheists for the sole purpose of donating to those in need . One such organization is called S.H.A.R.E . - Secular Humanist Aid and Relief Effort . Here is a recent story about them helping those in need . So , when someone ignorant and closed-minded like grizzly6626 tries to convince you that 'only religions ' donate or help those in need , you will now know that it 's simply not true , and that people from all beliefs , even those that do n't believe in God , help others in need and donate from their hearts , because they know it 's the right thing to do for their fellow man in need
It 's not just a kernel of uncertainty . Jews and Christians alike say that Moses wrote the Pentateuch , but a reading of the Pentateuch makes it obvious that this can not be true . Luke did not write the book of Luke , the apostle Matthew did not write the book of Matthew , and we do n't even claim to know the authors of many books of the Bible . Look up the Documentary hypothesis ; early scholars shuffled `` holy writings '' together like a deck of cards to get the Old Testament that everybody today knows and loves .
And depending on what human is `` finding the answers '' it can unfortunately cheapen and deny many central Biblical teachings .
So then you will agree that evolution is useless in getting at possible answers on what really matters , how we got here ? If you concede that then I 'm happy to end this discussion . I recall , however , visiting the Smithsonian and seeing a detailed description of how amino acids combined to form the building blocks of life . Evolutionary theory does address origins and its explanations are unsuppported by evidence . politicalref.com
I think Carlene is referring more to the 'implanting a fertile embryo/zygote into the uterus ' IVF version rather than just using donated sperm cells . So essentially the various healthy sperm are selected and incubated with healthy eggs ( so you have selected them to avoid a birth defect , or because most of the eggs are unviable and you are using a donor one ) , a selection of viable embryos are then given the chance to implant themselves in the woman 's uterus . The process involves a lot of zygotes being created , many of which will be unviable and a lot may have been able to develop properly but seeing as usually only one will implant they end up wasted . I can see pro-lifers objecting to the slightly wasteful technique ( with some just discarded and not even given the chance to develop ) but I think in this situation you ca n't really complain about the ones which did n't implant - seeing as this happens often enough in normal people , and may have been the reason the couple went after IVF in the first place . Might be wrong , but in short I think she means IVF rather than artificial insemination . I 'd also like to hear the reasoning if it is actually insemination though .
As far as I 'm aware your aim is for abortion not to happen , my point is that despite making it illegal it will still happen -- making it illegal is not achieving your aim . Hence my point is sound , and as such it is a good point .
So all jellyfish die on the beach ? Hardly . Let 's use this same type of logic though . A jellyfish is pretty fragile , as you pointed out . Would n't a jellyfish that was very rapidly covered in sediment be broken into many pieces , if not ground to a paste ?

You are right . Jyoshu does n't get it .
Yes , 1 ) It 's against Gods Law-an Abomination . 2 ) God loves the gay people but hates the Sin- there is help- I can get any gay person in contact with someone who used to be gay and has been set free and he will be willing to help , just let me know and i will get his websight to you and his phone number if you like . 3 ) Jesus loves you and you still have a chance to have questions answered that no one in the secular world can answer .

Well , that 's not quite right . Science is a methodology for investigating phenomena , not an enumeration of them . So it is perfectly possible to scientifically investigate , say , the power of prayer . Consider for a moment what you actually mean by 'materialistically ' : what is it that defines something as being material ? Gravity is every bit as intangible as a miracle , yet you would automatically characterise it as being part of the material world . Why ? The answer is that it is amenable to the scientific method : assertions about gravity can be repeatably tested . If ghosts and poltergeists were amenable to the same methodology , it would be possible to construct scientific theories concerning those , too , and they would be considered no more exotic or 'supernatural ' than clouds or rainbows . When you get your head around that , it 's immediately apparent that it is n't the power of prayer or spirituality per se that are n't scientific , it 's the methodology people have for dealing with them . Indeed , when the scientific method is applied and does n't yield the results believers in such matters want , the typical response is to come up with excuses why we should n't expect the scientific method to work . Unfortunately you ca n't have it both ways ; if you want to come to the party you have to adopt the dress code . Really , none of this would be a problem if science did n't have a ( from a religious perspective ) nasty habit of finding explanations for , or hidden and unexpected complexities within , features of the material world about which religious texts or leaders had already made firm pronouncements . Because despite the fact that you , SS , and others see science and evolution as an enemy of your philosophy and spirituality , the actual bone of contention is always in the material world . So who 's really treading on whose toes here ? It 's your choice to shackle your spirituality to a particular - and demonstrably wrong - version of material events , SS , not mine .
Oh , but Sina does not live in a womb so she is unimportant .
Oh , his brain was n't there , huh ? Musta just been involuntary reflexes that allowed him walk from a store to the `` home '' that he stayed at . Oh , and please show me some cases of foetuses walking to the store like this man did when he was attacked , and then we can start comparing . Looks like VT is back with his usual strawmen and sensationalism .
See Sarge 's post about Ted Kennedy being listed . What did he do that would make him get on the terrorist watch list ? And what about the four year old boy who was denied flight because his name was also on the watch list ? Because his name was the alias of a known terrorist . What answers do you have to address these points ? We 've had plenty of people claiming that being on the no fly list , or the suspected terrorist watch list , should be all the criteria necessary for denying a person the right to buy a gun . And now we have the mayors claiming that failing the background check -even if it 's because the Attorney General is abusing his power- should be grounds for criminal prosecution . That 's not liberty . That 's not justice . That 's not freedom . That 's not American values . That 's completely unacceptable , and goes on the show the character of those who support gun control . Secret police and secret courts to be used against the American people will not be tolerated !
You interpret my request that you follow the rules and post a link , flocking here in utter dismay on my part ? How consistently irrational of you jason . Anyway , it seems that you are celebrating prematurely at this point since Congress must approve this move before it 's a done deal . DC City Council votes to legalize gay marriage ( AP )  4 hours ago WASHINGTON  Washington D.C. 's City Council has voted to legalize gay marriage in the nation 's capital . Mayor Adrian Fenty has promised to sign the bill , which was co-sponsored by 10 of the council 's 13 members . The final vote Tuesday was 11-2 . The bill now goes to Congress , which has final say over the district 's laws . Opponents say they 'll try to get Congress or voters to overturn it . Passage of the bill is a victory for gay marriage supporters , who have been dealt a recent string of defeats in Maine , New York and New Jersey . Gay marriage is legal in Massachusetts , Connecticut , Iowa and Vermont . New Hampshire will begin issuing licenses in January . If Congress does n't reject the bill , D.C. should start issuing marriage licenses around St. Patrick 's Day.The Associated Press : DC City Council votes to legalize gay marriage
What 's your definition of pure ?
Actually , it is a tip-off that they need to pick one interpretation or confuse their position by trying to assume all three .
So then you support a states right to stop all drivers on their borders and make them retest for drivers licenses and pay to register thier cars before being allowed to drive in the state ?
Our emphasis on Police and crime fighting reduced crime . Not gun control ! Our murder rate is largely an Inner City drug and drug gang related problem . Fix that and then you will finally be doing something !
You deny what I wrote is your position . Well if your position is n't that `` it 's not necessary to have high capacity magazines because gun owners can reload quickly when defending themselves against criminals '' then logically your position must be that such high capacity magazines are necessary for self defense . But if such magazines would benefit law abiding citizens in an armed conflict then why could n't they also benefit criminals ?
He 's saying it 's a non-issue to Christians , which it is . He said that evolution , so far as it concerns man 's bodily origins , is really a theological non-issue . With certain qualifications such as God 's ultimate role in man 's creation , the direct creation of the human soul by God and man 's inherent dignity as a person , the theory of evolution need n't be seen as contrary to Christian revelation .
Oh , no , young Skywalker . It is you who are wrong . About a great , many , things . The title above what you are reading says `` Which is more likely to become a dictatorship '' , not `` It 's impossible to turn a country with loose gun laws into a dictatorship . '
I think the reason for the differences in translations is because the translations i think are geared more to audience . There are easier translations for little kids and those who have a hard time with bigger words . Another thing that has to be taken into account is that it is not always easy to translate exactly from one language to another . Some English words have several equivalents in other languages so the differences in the translations come from which equivalent was chosen by the translators . P.S . This of course is not to argue with what the person stated above .
Well , you see , it is only Christianity that claims it is new and unique ( it is n't though ) . It is Chrisitanity that is dependant on it 's beliefs , ( even the very mythical ones ) being historically accurate . This would n't be a problem at all , except that Christianity also is a 'exclusive ' religion , that claims that it is the only right way . Of course , if you get a muslim in here making similar claims to the claims that Christianity makes , you will get an equal reaction from the same people who critize Christianity ( for the exact same reasons )
It would be a great scientific discovery .
Actually , breeding horses and donkeys is n't an effort to create a new species . Where did you get such a thoughtless idea . And neither is interbreeding lions and tigers . However , you do n't seem to be aware that neither ligers or tigons are sterile . They are capable of breeding with each other or with either of the parent species . And then there are polar bears and brown bears , which can and will interbreed if given the opportunity . And the offspring are perfectly fertile .
Prove it . Got any credible scientific or sociological studies ? NOPE , ya do n't . Did n't think so .
And what of when you go by some moral standard to determine what is right and wrong in other peoples ' lives as well ? What ? you do n't do that ? Bull . You ca n't tell me you never have an opinion or judgment on anything anyone else does . But by your logic , that would be imposing on them . Sorry , that dog just does n't hunt . Everyone has some basis for the views they have about they way they think society would be best . There 's no law that says people ca n't participate in that process with religion or anything else as their moral basis . 'Imposing religion ' is not the same as using religion as a basis , and it 's the fact that you are wrong on this that 's why religious people are continually able to have religion as their basis of social change , just as equally as anything else .
It would be 'an ' analogy , but like the language analogy , it has its limitations . It is interesting to note that creationist computer software developers/programmers can not seem to agree on the implications of 'mutations ' when using such analogies - one such person , C.K . Lester , declared that computer programs can accumulate up to 30 % 'random change ' , just like DNA ( hypothetically ) can , therefore , the computer analogy is a good one . But programmer R. David Pogge declares that even a single altered bit in a line of computer code a million bits in length would destroy it .
So being easy to know makes it good ? methinks that 's not quite right .
Actually what scientists have is a provisional theory that material causes are sufficient to explain material outcomes . Its provisional and subject to falsification should anyone ever find a valid counter example . So far none such has turned up oddly enough . And yes under that assumption science must be agnostic . Just because GOD can not get a foot in the door does not imply that he can not stand outside the door does it ?
You are just plain pathetic in your pursuit of dishonest argument on behalf of the health insurance industry . They were not insured , they could not get in for treatment without insurance , both were preventable deaths , costs were unbelievable , and you know it . You could n't care less about that mother and unborn child . You do n't care about any unborn children . You worship the Almighty Dollar . That 's all . You are politically finished in this country and you know it . Everyone is sick and tired of the lies and greed of your ilk . Your Demon Ship is sinking fast and you know it .
Well , so much for unbiased reporting !
Your question itself is a problem . God is 'He who is ' , not a 'what ' .
Your obvious ignorance of medical procedure is astonishing . I do not think any such uninformed person has a right to an opinion , but since you have decided you do , let me try to inform you . A doctor would never `` stick a pair of scissors '' into a baby 's head . Any propaganda that has told you otherwise is just that , propaganda . If the doctor is `` holding in his hands '' a baby about to be born , ( which implies labor ) and that child weighs more than 500 grams ( just under two pounds ) , he is required by law to do all in his power to protect and support that child 's life . Partial-birth abortion is done only in a case when the mother 's life is at stake , no , it does not always `` save the mother 's life '' in some cases it is done as a prophylaxis against an event in which life-saving measures would be deemed neccessary . Example- the mother has advanced liver disease , when she concieved it seemed as though it would be possible to carry the child , but as her pregnancy advanced , so did her disease , so that now she is in complete renal failure . The doctors advise her that if she continues with her pregnancy , she is putting her own life and that of ther child into jeopardy . He urges her to abort the child , in order to save her life . This is one case where a partial-birth abortion would be the method . If the woman decides to continue her pregnancy , she might die , the child might die as well . But if she chooses not to have the child , she lives to fight another day . Tough choices- What right on earth would I have to enter into this situation and tell her that `` god says you got ta put your life at risk and carry this child , even though both of you might die '' ? ? ? ? I may be sick , but I pride myself on the ability to create an informed opinion on a matter , and until I am informed , I keep my opinions to myself . That should be in the bible somewhere
And you 're perfectly entitled to believe that , so long as you understand that doing so entails believing that this seperate species , which you claim lived alongside chimps and humans from the very beginning , just happened to leave a fossil in precisely the right stratum to make it look transitional . Just like all the other hominid fossils . Are you starting to see my point yet ? You 're trying to claim that because Lucy is n't conclusive proof , she means nothing . That 's fallacious reasoning : Lucy contributes to the accumulated evidence supporting common descent . I do n't find Lucy 's bones , in isolation , to be convincing evidence of common chimp/human ancestry . Even their discovery in just the right stratum is n't on its own completely convincing - it could be a fluke . But how many such flukes can one plausibly hypothesise ? All the hundreds of other Australopithecus afarensis fossils dug up , for instance - surely some of them ought to have been found in anomalous strata if they had really coexisted with all other species from the beginning .
If someone gets busted for providing a firearm to a criminal there is already Serious jail time , regardless of what you say you want . It is totally irrelevant what you or I want . Totally irrelevant . In fact no one is even asking us . We have a whole Federal Department dedicated to gun crimes and criminals . I can understand that you , and apparently people like the Illegal Mayors headed by Bloomberg might think they are not doing the job up to your standards , but Bloomie and his bunch was asked to cease and deist because they were ruining Federal and local investigations . The way I see it , is , you want special privileges with your law .
But SS would say that neandertals are humans , right ? All creationists I have seen say that . Just put neandertals in modern clothes and you would not notice them on a city street . So their DNA should be identical to H. sapien 's by that theory .
Oh sorry , I did n't understand what you were asking . Ok , what I think happened { Like Tasyfish hinted at } was that Moses recorded what god told him or Genesis 1 because it is in more detail , and Genesis 2 is what was passed down through Noah , in Oral history , so it would differ slightly , but that 's becaue of man 's error , not God 's .
Wait on , we are confusing our history here . Catholic Church was a branch of The Church , along with the then Byzantine Orthodox domonination . The Great Schism was between the Roman Catholic Church of the Papacy and the Orthodox Church of the Byzantine Empire . It took place in 1054 when the then Pope excommunicated the Byzantine Emperor from the Church ( who , not to be out done responded with his own excommunication of the Pope ) . They might of patched it up had it not been for the sacking of Constantinople in 1204 by the Fourth Crusade initiated by Pope Innocent II . Oooops ! The Protestant Church was formed by Henry VIII when he declared himself head of the Church in England in 1534 in place of the Pope by the Act of Supremacy , so he could divorce and marry as nescessary . He never did get a fit male heir though ... ..
Well , Void , as one that has been fighting these battles for a while now , I 've an observation . Those of us that believe the Right to Keep and Bear Arms is a constitutionally protected right , and please note , I did not say constitutionally given or granted right , your proof would be welcomed , and the chances are , we all have much of the same proof in our arsenals . To those that are adamant in their endeavors to control and eventually disarm Americans , no amount of proof will ever be sufficient . They are always of the mind ( if that 's possible ) our founders were either complete dumb asses regarding firearms , just a bunch of old , dead , white guys , had no concept of what the world would become , were backwoods bumpkins , or were entirely incapable of expressing how they really felt , so instead , expressed the antithesis to what they actually believed . Have I left anything out ?
Well said Jitobear . I could n't agree more .
WHAT ? I do n't see anything regarding that . Seriously , what are you talking about ?
Also another example put forward is a bacteria that can only sustain itself by eating Nylon . The theory goes - nylon is a recent invention therefore this bacteria must have eolved recently . What it suggests however is that a portion of an existing population would have died if not for nylon ... the bug has to have nylon , or it will die . It is akin to looking at a portion of the human population who would die from heart-trouble . But thankfully we 've now got artificial hearts , therefore this portion can survive . They are not a new species of human , but live only because of a recent invention .
No , it 's not . The conditions under which evolution operated during the Cambrian/Vendian times were different from the conditions following that time in two main ways , and these differences can potentially account for the origin of the many animal body plans during those early periods and the lack of new ones since . First , ~540 million years ago most animals were very much simpler ( fewer cells , for example ) than they are today , so changes to their developmental programs would have been better tolerated . The more complex any system is ( the more parts it has , and the more coordinated and well-matched those parts must be , etc . ) , the more rigidly constrained and less amenable to a given magnitude of change it is . So the simpler developmental processes ( simpler adult-form end product , fewer interactions between developmental genes , etc . ) of early animals would have allowed for a 'large-scale ' change to be incorporated into that animal 's ontogeny , though if a change of the same magnitude were to occur today , it would be too disruptive to the complex developmental program and would be eliminated ( note that 'large-scale change ' refers to the adult form : the actual change that caused that altered end result could be a typical small scale mutation , in an early developmental stage ) . This it not to propose Goldschmidt 's `` hopeful monsters '' that occur due to 'macromutations ' , but rather an intermediate position between that and the `` only micromutations '' view of gradualistic neo-Darwinism . And , as just mentioned , mutations in developmental processes ( even ones that resulted in 'macromutations ' in the adult form ) would have been more tolerated in the simpler animals that existed ~540 mya than they would be in today 's . Second , ~540 million years ago animal diversity was extremely more limited than it is today , so there was a huge number of open niches : a plentitude the likes of which has never again existed on our planet . An organism that happened to find itself in one of the multitude of open niches ( by means of a `` semi-macro '' mutation , the product of a change in a developmental gene ) would have faced little if any competition . The reduced external competition would potentially allow the morphological variation ( s ) , that would otherwise likely have been eliminated , to persist . ( The sudden change could leave the organism with a lower level of internal coordination : over time , internal coadaptation could evolve to 'catch up ' with the change in morphology : these internal adjustments would leave no trace in the fossil record ) . Combining these two ideas produces a reasonable explanation of the 'explosion ' in new body plans in Vendian/Cambrian times .
City council vote only , not sure about public sentiment , but from what I gather , most people do n't care because they do n't own guns . Whenever an issue like this comes up , people who are interested seem to become the loudest , both the pro- and anti-gun crowds .
So now you 're lying ? Whether or not the christians have been 'mislead ' ( which again is dubious given your astronomical arrogance ) , it does n't change the fact that christians accept evolution , which runs very contrary to both you and Marc 's asinine assertions that evolution is atheistic . So you readily admit that since non-christians who believe in a diety or dieties accept evolution , that evolution is therefore not atheistic ?
Working on it . Apparently we are still waiting for to to be graded ( it was really big , at leat 20 typed pages ) . I plan on buying from them when they get it back , and maybe putting up a whole page in honor of it . Partly because I think it is very telling , partly because I remember what it was like to be in college and get a little recognition for your work .
So atheists are capable of goodness , love , kindness , generosity and sympathy but they have no meaning unless one conforms the the fundamentalist christian morality .
That 's because its sophistry . Its an inherent contradiction and it simply means we do n't have the capacity to understand it . Another more common example is that the assertion that the universe can not be endless , and yet as far as we know it is . Trying to understand it is for us humans like an ant trying to fathom the theory of relativity . Damn are we ever conceited as a race ... we seem to think that if we ca n't understand something , it can not be . We also tend to think , in every generation , that we have achieved somehow the pinnacle of progress .
I do n't favor abortion but I favor a woman 's right to choose abortion .
A more precise term would be `` broaden , '' since nothing about the definition pertaining to the people currently covered by it would be affected , `` diluted '' or altered in any way anyone has yet demonstrated . Nothing about the definition that pertains to people who already are , or can be married changes one iota . Their rights , benefits , and protections remain exactly the same . The only `` change '' would be to other people , people who have no connection to , nor impact on , the marriages of anyone else : the gays who 'll marry if the legal definition is broadened to encompass them . And the only `` change '' in that regard will be the fact that they are encompassed by it , nothing more . No substantive aspect of the definition as it currently stands changes in the slightest . The change is not in the definition itself . It 's in who it applies to .
But you know it is more then just that . The poster gave a specific date that is relevant to when abortion was legalized . It shows the poster is being selective and may hold prejudice to fetuses who arent aborted by legal abortions . You see , it is the pro-life movement 's selective outrages that makes me think they are n't serious about abortion as a whole .
It does n't have to be that way because it 's the death penalty . It 's that way because of our ever deteriorating legal system .
I think we all could live with this .
Oh , we already know a bunch of events that he played a role in . They even made it into a song ! Please allow me to introduce myself I 'm a man of wealth and taste I 've been around for long , long years Stole many man 's soul and faith And I was 'round when Jesus Christ Had his moment of doubt and pain Made damn sure that Pilate Washed his hands and sealed his fate Pleased to meet you Hope you guess my name But what 's puzzling you Is the nature of my game I stuck around St. Petersburg When I saw it was a time for a change Killed the Czar and his ministers Anastasia screamed in vain I rode a tank Held a general 's rank When the blitzkrieg raged And the bodies stank Pleased to meet you Hope you guess my name , oh yeah Ah , what 's puzzling you Is the nature of my game , oh yeah ( woo woo , woo woo ) I watched with glee While your kings and queens Fought for ten decades For the gods they made ( woo woo , woo woo ) I shouted out , `` Who killed the Kennedys ?

So for example if I say `` you are a part of my body , and therefore I have a right to kill you '' , is this simply a matter of ideology ? I admit the distinction is not clearcut at early stages of development , but how do you support the idea that post-birth children are `` a part '' of their mothers ' bodies and therefore legitimate to kill ? It is no more legitimate to say that a fetus is a part of a woman 's body than it is to say that a woman is a part of a fetus ' body . Just as a woman is not a subordinate slave to the fetus within her , the fetus can not be considered subordinate in rights to the woman it is inside .
Actually , I looked at the sight rather thoroughly , and I was unable to find any real mention of `` sensible '' gun policies . But then I looked deeper and found out why . This is simply a marketing ploy by the Brady Center aimed at the religious crowd , so the `` sensible '' policies that they support are really just the same policies that the Brady Center puts forth . Just another way of reaching out to a different demographic .
Let 's make sure we 're talking about the same thing here Art . You do n't find this reprehensible ? FROM THE OP : According to Williams and the Florida Department of Health , she went into labor and delivered a live baby girl . What Williams and the Health Department say happened next has shocked people on both sides of the abortion debate : One of the clinic 's owners , who has no medical license , cut the infant 's umbilical cord . Williams says the woman placed the baby in a plastic biohazard bag and threw it out.You do n't see placing a live new born baby in a bio hazard bag and throwing it into a trash receptacle as medical staff stood by and watched as shocking and disgraceful ? Not to mention murder ? Is that what you 're telling me ?
Er , they are held to the same standards . ID fails to meet them . That 's the point
Neener neener - is it time to go in from the playground yet ?
That 's a vague statement .
You are , in effect , telling me that putting someone in a position that will inevitable leave them dead does not make you responsible for their death . If I fire a bullet at your head , while that bullet is in mid-air , I am no longer doing anything to hurt you , and you are fine . However , I have set in motion affects that will result in your demise . This makes me responsible for your death .
Actually , you could probably make your point better if you referred to a `` theistic evolutionist '' who rejected all creation stories ( and other history ) in the bible . As for your point itself , it is fairly correct ( in my opinion ) . Theistic evolution makes no assertions that contradict either evolutionary theory or the teachings of the bible ( morals , etc . ) . This presents no problems for atheistic evolutionists .
So you 're both wrong .
Oh please get over yourself here . You know all too well that gays do n't affect you or your livelyhood . But everything that was pointed out in the OP letter EFFECTS EVERYONE . So , yes , there are other MUCH MORE important things to deal with . What you do n't seem to understand is that the whole issue of gay marriage is simply a distraction from the real messes all around . Do n't go pointing the `` distraction '' finger at US , when we 're the ones calling people like you on them .
Right . It 's called stasis . Species that are well adapted to their environments tend to change little in a stable environment . It is still true that fossil crocs are not the same as modern crocs . There are obvious differences .
Actually you do n't know what circumstances went on . However , it would be better if you stuck to the topic . Unless you feel compelled by genes to perform ad hominem at every opportunity .
Wow . A very unusual and distressing story , and probably why saline abortions are no longer used . It is very unfortunate for her to have to live with that disability .
And how would they be able to trace those 30 percent back to gun shows , if there are no background checks carried out ? Hm ? Care to explain that one for the rest of the class ? If they 're coming from private transactions , then there 's no record , and the number made up is pure BS . If they came from a licensed dealer who was doing business at a gun show , then it would be no different from them being traced to a licensed gun store .
So it is a bad thing that children read about people and families that exisist and that they are likely to come across ? What about King and King ? That is a story of a prince falling in love with another prince . If King and king has an agenda then so does snow white , cinderella , Repunzel , and sleeping beauty . Ever read the real stories for yourself , not the cleaned up Disney versions , they are gruesome little tales that would give any child nightmares and make King and King look tame .
So laws passed by the legislature are `` state approved '' while rulings of the courts are not ? The media portrayal of gay rights is always awful .
And if someone had written an ad proclaiming that black Americans are inferior the same thing would have happened as well . I ca n't justify what they did but when you put such a hot-button issue out like that into the open ... it has to be expected . People have strong feelings about abortion rights ( just like racism ) and it is naive to think something like this was n't going to happen .
It 's not part of any rhetoric -- evolution is fact . It 's no more rhetoric than gravity or the founding principles behind Newtonian Physics .
Maybe they just drink too much coffee . And you probably work with more `` reefer heads '' than you think .
Like most things theists that statement is based on ignorance .
So you dont know ?
You could try to be a good person and nevermind about the hocus pocus stuff . I 'm not tryimg to convince you of anything . The fact is that what you use a reasons to believe do n't hold up under logical scrutiny . Do n't justify faith with logic . That only cheapens faith .
Well I like Hoppe 's argumentation ethics approach .
On the contrary ... These individuals ( or individual -- whichever it may be ) , contributed significantly to the creation/evolution forum . Evidently , each one of them at some point posted something deemed worthy to have them banned by the forum moderators according to the subjective rules of the forum . Their presence is missed . I figured this would be the one forum that would most likely catch their attention , should they be perusing through . Without the strong presence of a resident biologist , my opinion is that this forum has limited opportunities to learn new and interesting information about evolution . Such information can help individuals see evolution as reasonable instead of perceiving it as something evil that is devoid of God , or put in their minds by the devil , etc . If the moderators feel that this is not an appropriate post for this forum , then they have to make the call to delete it . Just to make it a debate , though , I 'll pose this question : *********************************** Does anyone else miss the presence of any one of the individuals who was behind the usernames of Lurch and Ungerdunn ? Why or why not ? ***********************************
Yes it is .
Pregnancy is always harmful to the woman 's body . However , if the pregnancy is desired then the changes are welcomed by the woman . To a woman who does not want to be pregnant then those changes are very unwelcome and are a bad thing . Pregnancy is always harmful , but the perception of what is happening changes depending on the woman . You do not understand that whether or not pregnancy harms the woman 's body is objective , but whether or not the woman wants the pregnancy anyway depends on the woman . You are mixing the two .
What possible concern is any of that to you ? Some actually search for knowledge through debate . This is a debate forum if you recall . Do n't play if you 're not so inclined but to post warnings not to fall in this trap , c'mon .
Oh gosh , a whole bunch of cut/pastes from a 14 year old that is showing off their lack of knowledge . These are not unknown situations , and are very easily explained .
Well , if you know people of color who are adopted then that must mean that there is no problem with the number of children of color who ca n't be placed in adopted homes !
Evidence or logic that causes you a problem is not a red herring . As for arguing by personal attack , once again I think I 've been remarkably patient given the unending stream of dismissive and insulting comments I 've endured along the way .
This is what socially inept losers do when they know their argument is # # # # , deny they ever made one . I 've asked repeatedly for an example of the evolution of a new body part in a population and all you 've done is confirm the fact that you 're an absolute # # # # # .
I 've been posting at least a few times a week . That 's a lot more than once a month . I pointed out that the US has higher levels of gun crime than most developed nations while you tried to focus on a few tragedies in response to someone questioning the claim that criminals will always get guns . I think it 's obvious whose argument is more cherry picked .
No more so than the Scalia/Uncle Clarence Thomas cabal opining that the words NO LAW mean something other than what they do when they rule in a First Amendment case .
Wrong .
Bellesiles claimed his data was destroyed in a flood . Lott claimed his data was destroyed in a computer crash . Some people have been calling John Lott `` the Bellesiles of the Right . '' Read this article `` The Bellesiles of the Right ? Another firearms scholar whose dog ate his data . '' http : //slate.msn.com/id/2078084/ John Lott has already admitted to inventing a fan ( Mary Rosh ) to praise himself . That 's intentionally trying to deceive people . http : //www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp ... & amp ; notFound=true
Theories change since they are just that - theories . Once time and sufficient investigation has given them sufficient weight , they become laws . Newton 's laws were derived to explain direct human experiences ( we deal with relatively large objects going at slow speeds relative to the speed of light ) and for that regime , they remain true . Since there were still a multitude of basic unanswered questions at the time in Science ( about light , the nature of matter , etc . ) , investigation continued and found , in the 20th century , the laws of relativity and quantum mechanics to explain occurrences outside of the range of the large and slow that we experience . At the beginning of science ( say ~17th century ) , there were a lot more questions than answers . Now , its the other way around - at least when it comes to the essential theoretical basis behind things that human 's experience .
I do n't drink and I 'm not overweight . But I bet you have a bad habit with junk food and FOX news/couch potatoism . With a sixpack by your side .
Then why are you a Global Warming Advocate Jo ? Since you just produced evidence that over the last 150 years , throughout the complete Industrial Revolution since fossil fuels have been being burned , the Atmospheric Co2 levels worldwide have only gone up by 100 ppm ? http : //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedi ... on_Dioxide.png Are you forgetting that the Earth 's atmosphere has the ability to constantly clean itself , so once we get third world industrialized countries throughout Asia and Africa to adopt clean air policies , world wide air pollution will become a distant memory in no time at all ? Also , your stats in addition to these stats http : //scienceandpublicpolicy.org/pr ... te_crisis.html prove that the threat of Global Warming is a myth .
Worship not money , and I will bless you .
Really ?
I think he meant a sycophant .
Absolutely true ! I discovered that with my fluoride research ... For whatever reason , most people take another 's word for what the truth actually is instead of searching for it themselves . If the lie is an easier pill to swallow than the truth pill , they 'll take the lie .
So let me get this straight - you admit that you are wrong , and you want me to provide documentation to prove this admission correct ? How about we both simply agree that you were wrong and move on .
Yes , amazing , how they were n't people before .
Now you are being insulting . Evolution makes no statments about your god . For that matter , neither does cosmology , astronomy , chemistry , physics or geology .
So will they be in front of or behind a leaf ?
Well I do n't know about you guys , but I was baptized so I 'm out of that eternal damnation thing .
Actually , I think the shoe is on the other foot so to speak ... .. YEC has not made any valid rebuttal of evolution or the AoE yet , and that is the camp which is making claims for absolute truth ( off course , we know this itself is not true but based on a point of view ) . Re : your initial statement , why should it ? do Surgeons need faith in Surgery ? do enginners need faith in structural engineering ?
If you feed me a lot of caffinated coffee i start to wiggle and squirm too . I 'm not really in any pain .
That would depend on how the poll was done , and what education levels were compared . Comparing high school educated with college educated , I would believe your statement , considering today 's extreme left leaning college administrators . If a poll was conducted among the LEAST educated ( prison populations - unwed welfare mothers - deadbeat dads - intercity homeless , etc ) I would n't need a poll to tell me that almost none of them would believe in creation . It 's interesting that the most educated , and the least educated , could very well have similar worldviews , largely that once life is over it was purposeless and pointless . There is good reason the U.S. does n't leave political decisions to only the highly educated .
Wouldnt it be wonderful if every woman in the world had access to decent prenatal care , if every woman in the world could be guanateed safe childbirth , wouldnt it be wonderful ? The entire series is at : http : //www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/opinion/10gift.html And , if men had to suffer the torture of being in labor for a week and having their insides torn out , do n't you think the male-centered world would truly care more about the welfare of women and children ?
While your story is a sad one I disagree that you should be happy with having a `` second chance '' . I believe this because you gave your unborn child no chance . I probably should n't say `` you '' because it seems like you did n't have a choice in the matter . Anyway , thank you for sharing your story and welcome to the forums .
That `` somebody '' was a Jesuit priest , the idea met some initial resistance because of it 's religious overtones . But the overwhelming evidence in favor of it carried the day . You should study some history too .
So we should only feel compassion if there is pain ?
Oh good grief ! I have always lived in rough areas . In one city , Alburquerque , a drug deal went sour 10 feet fom where I slept , and a guy had his head blasted away by a shotgun . Where I worked , less than a block away , a gunner massacred everyone in a video rental place . I was even obliged to ferry a guy with a slash on his throat to an ER , I did n't know the stupid beast , I was scared to death , but I felt it my Christian duty ( even though I am not a Christian ) to get the guy to where he could get treatment . And I do n't own a damned gun because I am not chicken-hearted .
I think more than this is the principle of human dignity . That humans have inherent dignity and value at every stage of life . This is transcendent of whether they are conscious or unconscious and it is why we treat 24 week premies who have no real conscious existence and a 30 year old automobile accident victim in a coma on a respirator and you and me the same . So strongly do humans recognize this inherent dignity that even in death a person is dignified with a funeral ceremony recognizing their life had inherent meaning and value . We build memorials to those who were victimized in life .
Well , in the sense that we can not actually detect the intelligent design Behe proposes , then it it OUTSIDE the limit of actual detection .
So do 25,000 year old cave paintings .
I have a feeling that the tradtitional marriage the Dobson is refering to is only about 100 years old . Hardly traditional if you view it in the perspective of history . Up until the turn of the 20th century marriage was about property . The man physically owned the woman and the children . I sometimes laugh at these cithgaps , espically the women , when they talk about defending the traditional marriage . They are trying to defend a redefinition of something that has allready been redefined .
What Is a Human Person and Who Counts as a Human Person ? : A Crucial Question for Bioethics by Prof. William E. May There is also an extremely academic school of thought which views the human person in terms of the ego in all its derivations . I can not hope to summarize what this is all about , please refer to : Philosophical Critiques : The Human Person - 3 One could also consider the social development of an infant , inasmuch as humans are , in most cases , very social animals . According to primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy , the human species is specifically developed to be part of a social system and a newborn infant comes ready made to push all the buttons of the system :
If anyone is pushing ID , YEC is an issue . ID as a `` foot in the door '' maneuver in an effort to teach science . The problem is that most school boards are made up of Christians who think that their religion is somehow supported by science , and they do n't see the harm in teaching their idea of god as science . You seem to fit that picture pretty well .
Well , your parents ' parents also had parents who had parents who had parents which all streams back down to 2 people who God created ... adam and eve . so ultimately your life is a gift from God because the whole human race was created by Him .
Well , look who 's all pompous about something , and still get it wrong . Either way , earth or universe , you are still wrong , as for many decades the age of the universe has been put in the high single digits to the teens . We have never claimed it was 4 billion years old , that would just be retarted , as that is the age of the earth . Maybe you should check your facts and make sure you do n't get them wrong whentrying to argue about the subject .
I believe a man should be able to opt out of fatherhood . The problem with this article for me is the moral ambiguity - there is no consistent argument laid out for free choice , that is choice for women and men , or even one for consistent slavery ( forced births from women , forced money from men ) . It reeks of the vindictiveness that can be seen in any number of fringe movements , of the `` I do n't really care whether we live in a just society , as long as you 're not treated better than me '' . So yes , I `` a real pro-choicer '' agree with Matt here , the pro-choicers who are portrayed as disagreeing appear to be some kind of stereotyped 1970s feminist-socialist-activist-bra-burning type .
ouch , that certainly takes simone down a notch . http : //www.refuseandresist.org/ab/
And lets ont forget the parts where they did n't completely relabel all of the creation to ID and we ended up with `` Cdesign proponentsists ''
Because there are still a lot of people in this country that support oppression and injustice toward gay people .
By creating an experiment in which we observe it taking place .
Aside from this being completly wrong , it is quite compelling . You make a good point in regard to an organism 's form only making sense in relation to its environment . Of course , this is a cornerstone of evolutionary theory . Organisms that are more successful in a certain environment will reproduce and be the ones present in said environment . It actually is possible to look at genes without the context of the orginal creature . This is why we can move genes from one organism and place them in another . Given a complete understanding of molecular biology , we could contruct any form of organism we desired from scratch .
Your finger is alive , but is it a life of its own ?
Yes I do understand this . But you must admit that the instantaneous formation of a living organism , even an extremely primitive one , complete with the complexity of the DNA code as a result of random encounters of atoms and molecules is a little too much to buy . There is evidence right there for creationism . Only intelligence could have formed such an elaborate complex system for the structure of life and its propagation .
I would say that the soul is that part of us that is immortal . It is our essence . Our personality may impact or is impacted by it , but I would say it is far more . Indeed , I would say it is what psychologists call emergent downward causality . As for the role of God , science has not disproven any of it . Science has explained how things occur but that does not eliminate the possibility of god nor does it limit what god does . We would simply not be understanding gods fit in the science of it . That makes sense given that god is considered infinite and we are finite . I think the soul is what gives us the possibility of even imagining the infinite . The idea that we can see beyond what we are or even to conceptualize such things gives a clue that there is more to us than meets the eye . I do not see why God and science can not coexist . Even evolution and creation . Forget planting evidence . That is too far fetched . I would rather think that it is more likely that what God says actually fits the evidence even though we can not understand it . I do not know about God or `` not god '' ( if you will ) but if there is a God then the idea that he is beyond what I can actually conceive and yet completely conceivable makes sense for that kind of being . It should be an apparent paradox to me . If it is not , then my concept of God is faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr to small to be of any use to anyone . Huck .
An agnostic believes gods can not be logically known ( ie require faith ) . One can believe in the Christian god at the same time .
Well , fine . If you can quote a scientist claiming the above , I 'll join you in declaring her mistaken . You could be searching a long time .
Again , logically incorrect . That 's like saying there must be a world just like this one where water flows uphill - clearly that 's nonsense : this world has been shaped by forces that ensure water flows downhill .
Well , you 're writing from an embryo 's point of view , when an embryo does n't even have a point of view . It would be like writing from a rock 's point of view .
Abstinance ? ! Heaven forbid .
Nor is there any need for some mythical molecular elemental , nebulas natural selection , or mystical transitionals based on peicemeal forensics and antithestic rhetoric .
And you are only trying to earn yourself brownie points in hell .
Really ? From what university did you earn your science degree that makes you qualified to make judgements about what is science ?
Well nobody has turned up the Ark have they , termites could assure that if properly used . After 40 days and more they would be ravenous .
Evidence is n't peer reviewed . ( *-see correction below ) Analysis of evidence and conclusions drawn from that evidence are what 's peer reviewed . And , even after its gone through the peer review process , it has n't `` proven '' anything . The conclusions are either supported by the evidence or they are n't . Conclusions are drawn and explanations for phenomena are offered . The explanations are accepted ( for publication ) if the peers ( other scientists , sometimes competitors ) are convinced that the explanations offered are valid . There are plenty of papers about dinos > bird and fish > amphibians .
While it may be true that an ovum is formed during the mother 's fetal stage , an ovum is not a unique human entity in and of itself . It does not become a unique human entity until it is fertilized at conception . ( Do you like semantics games ? )
I am curious about the logic you used in your reasoning in thinking that pro-choice proponents would support having one of the girls on the video killed to let the other one have a better life . What , specifically , in anything that we have said would make you think that killing one of those girls would be ok ? Since you brought up the questions , I wonder what your answer would be to that second question : `` Can one girl kill herself or do harmful things to her body if she chooses ... even against the other heads will ? '' Along those lines , do you support people 's rights to kill themselves ?
** I `` pretend '' to nothing . I am not `` pretending '' to beilieve you to be a materialit/darwinist . I do believe exactly that . And as for your threat to make my arguments look silly , I 'm not shaking in my boots . I 've made your arguments look presumptuous , pretentious and silly , but you have never yet succeeded in doing that to any of mine .
Oh , the actions/intentions of the religious get much worse than just that . Hopefully , everyone will be scared a bit by the following statements made by nationally known religious leaders/activists .
Can I tidy up this leftover part ... ? Fractionally .
I know this may seem obvious to most people , but it seems to have escaped the notice of creationists . Birds are tetrapods , as are amphibians , reptiles , and mammals . Birds did n't just grow wings . Wings are adaptions of the front limbs that were covered with feathers . Perhaps you are unaware of the evidence that indicates that maniraptors had feathers , probably for thermoregulation . Saying that there is no mechanism for birds to grow wings when they previously had none is like saying that there is no mechanism for mankind to grow arms when he previously had none . You see , mankind 's closest relatives are the two species of chimpanzee - they are quadrupeds .
can we get a better difination of `` gun control '' ? are you talking the leval of regulation i have in Indiana , the levals in NYC , having no controles ( no checks , no licences for carry , no tax stamp for NFA weapons ) , or the other side of just asking Mr. and Mrs. America to turn them in ?
Why not ? People that support abortion hold the view that the woman is more important than the unborn . If you rank humans and force something upon a certain group in one case why would n't you approve of it in another ? Eugenics is just saying a certain group of citizens is below another ... kinda like an unborn is below a female ... and then saying `` we are going to make sure you do n't reproduce and we will put you in this home '' ... with abortion you just kill the person . Atleast Sanger took her views to the only logical conclusion .
Just as you constantly lie here to us on this board , now you are lying about your conduct on the road as a driver . I have had my license for a full 40 years now and have never had it revoked . Nor have I had an accident in over 25 years , but in those first 15 years I got 4 or 5 speeding tickets and all of them deserved . But none of them were for speeding in a school zone where children were present . And none of them were for public endangerment . I was famous for getting on the highway and cruising at 80 or 85 mph in a 65 . By this woman doing 35 in a school zone , she was doing 15 mph over the legal limit where children are present ; which of us do you think was more egregiously breaking the law ?
God talk about a bunch of foo foo poop ! What are you a girl ? Any way honey , dont you think that net result was a lot of people who for one reason or another could not resist there biological programming will get AIDS because they were told not to have sex in place of getting condoms ? I cant believe I had to explain that to you .
Certainly it does .
Actually , I 've heard it all before and it is wrong . The article is full of misinformation and misrepresentation . It is , as you say , slanted rather than an honest report of the data .
I know that I 've tried to make this argument before on another thread but Jesus was not God in that sence but the Son of God . God even says in the Bible that Jesus is his son so that they are apart of eachother but are not the same . Also , how do you know that a lot of the laws put into Leviticus were not just ones added by the chief priest ? After all , the Bible was writen down by human hands . Also I want to make reference to John 3 : 16-17 ( TEV* translation ) 16 : For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son , so that everyone who believes in him may not die but have eternal life . 17 : For God did not send his Son into the world to be its judge , but to be its savior . *I specify the translation because it seems that most of the posters are using KJV , which kind of annoys me when I try to read it .
But I see two people involved here . Whether the women is better off or not is irrelevant to me . She has no right to kill the other just like you have no right to kill your neighbor . I 'm not for allowing decisions on everything and to be against `` choices '' is not a bad thing considering every law restricts choices .
So ? In your religion 's view , everyone sins . Their sin is no greater or more unforgiveable than yours .
But the number of criminals that have firearms can be reduced . In developed nations that have very strict gun laws there are a lot less criminals obtaining and using guns to commit crimes . How does your theory explain that ?
Not to hijack the thread , but there 's a question about ID that I 've never been able to get an answer to . arn.org did n't help , but maybe you can DamEtel ? What was the Designer supposed to have actually done , and when ? I mean , did he create the first single celled creatures from scratch and dump them in the ocean billions of years ago , or did he just nudge some chemicals towards each other ? Did he cause specific mutations in certain animals at some point to get a desired result ? Or did he build animals from scratch , fully formed ? I ca n't find any answers to these questions anywhere .
There 's much more to it than that . There are several different kinds of genetic changes that are called mutations . Evolution is not limited to the effects of point mutations alone . Why do n't you demonstrate your competence to discuss this topic by defining a point mutation , and then name and define several other kinds of mutation . And , of course , there are other mechanisms that increase the genetic variability in any population besides mutation . On the other hand , there are mechanisms that tend to reduce the variability in a population in addition to natural selection . Please name and explain at least 4 others in order that you do not continue to look like a fool .
Then get your sick , satanic mitts off everyone else .
Then , how much money should spend on the war on terror ? Should we bankrupt the country to do it ? Is it necessary to spend so much that we go bankrupt , or is it better to wisely spend the money we have and to fight an intellegent war against terror ?
Once . This is the first time .
I know nothing of Nedow . That 's cutesy btw .
So then women who are pregnant should n't be allowed to 1 ) Smoke 2 ) Take any kind of drug that could possibly harm the child 3 ) Drink or do any otherwise legal action ? And VOR takes another giant step towards fascism .
I think Kronus pretty much covered that one ... quite well actually . It 's sad SS , you always harp against NS , but you obviously have no clue what NS is really all about . I suggest a little educational reading . I at least read the bible before I began to publically debate it 's validity .
Well , actually society has said that 18 is the dividing line . It can then also say , that under certain circumstances , for a particularly bad person , in some cases it will be considered if the person is 16 or 17 . That 's why we have all the judges and lawyers , etc ...
That only occurs with some animals under very specific conditions . And low and behold , animals need the genes that code for it .
Professor Heribert Nilsson , an evolutionist , writes : Is it really credible that random processes could have constructed a reality , the smallest element of which - a functional protein or gene - is complex beyond ... anything produced by the intelligence of man ? When asked why did the scientific world leap at the Origin of the Species , `` [ I suppose the reason ] we jump at the Origin was because the idea of God interfered with our sexual mores . '' Sir Julian Huxley Our ways of learning about the world are strongly influenced by the social preconceptions and biased modes of thinking that each scientist must apply to any problem . The stereotype of a fully rational and objective scientific method ,  with individual scientists as logical ( and interchangeable ) robots is self-serving mythology ARBITRARY ARRANGEMENT , R.H. DOTT , U. of Wis. & amp ; R.L . BATTEN , Columbia U. , A.M.N.H. , `` We have arranged the groups in a traditional way with the 'simplest ' forms first , and progressively more complex groups following . This particular arrangement is arbitrary and depends on what definition of 'complexity ' you wish to choose . ... things are alike because they are related , and the less they look alike , the further removed they are from their common ancestor . '' EVOLUTION OF THE EARTH , p.602 Storrs Olson , curator of birds at the National Museum of Natural History said : `` The idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at Nature and National Geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith . Truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program , which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age -- -the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion . ''
Sure they matter . But that is n't the issue here . You posted this in the abortion forums as if this medical malpractice which is taking place in an impoverished third world country is justification for it in America . That is a ludicrous and totally bogus argument to make . If you thought rationally , you would have it in the health forum and be complaining about how third world countries are so ill prepared for this common problem when we have the technology so readily available to avoid it . My Lord simone , a simple C-Section is all that is required to make this a non issue for mother and baby . But you ignorantly post this drivel as if abortion is the solution . It makes no sense at all , and yet you post it thinking that you 're contributing something rational . Go figure , huh ! ! !
Actually all decisions based on the self ARE selfish decisions . I really do n't care . I make them all the time too . Everyone does . While this is a philosophical issue I really see it as odd that people claim not to be selfish when doing something that benefits them or prevents harm to them with little regard to anyone else .
Ah , my bad ...
And there is still no evidence on the table for YEC .
Possibly that the US was not supposed to be , and is not a democracy ? In any case , the rulers were not `` common '' , neither were the people `` free '' .
That 's why I say , `` Kill the bastard ! ''
Now , I would agree with that .
So he knew everything Paul did , what was written in Revelation ...

Why is there this onus on the man to do everything ? As I said before , it is just as much the woman 's choice to have unprotected sex as it is the mans - if this is not the case , then it is already covered by rape laws . By your proposition , only the man need worry about birth control - the woman has no legal necessity to do so at all . It 's not a case that 'the man did the deed ' - both parties are potentially just as culpable . If you 're going to introduce legal consequences for abortion , they are going to have to affect all the guilty parties ; the woman included . However , personally I would argue against adding further legal restrictions to abortion .
Well of course everybody is entitled . But as history has shown many southern states in America chose to ignore the Constitution and deny black people their rights on the basis of their skin color , using the `` black codes '' enacted after the Civil War . If it were n't for the 14th Amendment that forced state governments to abide by the constitution , minorities would still be out in the cold . The only thing we 've been over , is that government and gun control is racist , not the Second Amendment .
Oh , well when you put it that way ... . Maybe you could address this one thing . `` The total elimination of arms from society . '' You 'd think someone from Brady might have said this somewhere , sometime , that you could compare to the memo . I would .
pro-choice is only pro child if the choice is not abortion and they are only pro family when the choice for family . So really pro choice can be pro child or anti child and pro family or anti family .
So , we are debating creation , yet you do n't consider quoting the bible , the single most important original proponent of the creation account and to you , it does n't qualify as a source for what is being discussed here ? You say this and expect to be taken seriously ?
This is ridiculous . Evolution is `` scientifically neutral '' . It 's you who has the bias .
And I 'm saying all but 16 states had already had the law removed before the Loving case . Most of these were done via the legislature and very few had the law overturned by a court . In fact , only California comes to mind as a state that had the statue overturned by the courts instead of on repeal by the legislature . Who knew ... but there is a wikipedia page on this : Anti-miscegenation laws - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia It does n't say whether or not it was via a court case or not but I know that California was a court case and Massachusetts and many Northern/mid-west state were via legislature action . Also , the Supreme Court case ruled the Virginia law unconstitutional not the Alabama law . It is just understood that similar laws will be overturned thus they are negated .

Ouch jyoshu ... you are hitting them outta the park today . Exactly , it sounds nice but it certainly is n't the only moral rule and it certainly does n't mean one follows it . I 'd say selfishness is probably the underlying value in many cases .
While it 's true that criminals wo n't be lining up to register guns that they already own , gun registration could make it harder for them to obtain more guns in the future . Registration could require law abiding citizens to be more careful about who they sell their guns to as well as making it easier to trace back a lost or stolen gun to the original owner .
Yes . It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result , outcome , whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action . That is why 'selection ' is always teleological . In order to select or choose anything , an end must always be in view . There must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end . The only time `` channel '' becomes teleological is when something live [ a human or a beaver , let 's say ] intententionally does the channeling . But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel ' , unintentional , out of simple mechanics , the word channel can not be called teleological . In the same way , 'sorting ' can be considered non-teleological , hence mechanical , and thus suited to your glossary , because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone . But 'selection ' always requires volition and awareness . So 'selection ' is always teleological .
Perhaps the best way to defeat Accipiter in a debate is to stay silent and watch him make fallacies . Asking you questions about relativity seemed to effectively take you out of that debate but asking me questions has not .
Does n't it ever bother you that you have to come up with ridiculous hypothetical sci-fi scenarios to attempt to prove your side ? First of all , do you really think a head on life support is going to `` be no different mentally from someone with a body . `` ? I would say that would probably mess with somebody 's head a bit . Secondly , you sound like you believe this person who is a head on life support deserves equal rights . They are just as helpless as a fetus in the womb . Are you saying it 's okay to murder people who ca n't think and talk ? Do you believe that thinking and talking is what qualifies a person for rights ?
Answered above . I edited my post with further explanation .
Because ? The conventional big bang is just as unlikely as God . Therefore your claim is wrong . However the current believe mainly among physicists and astronomers is that there is no end and there is no beginning to the universe . Expansionary theories along with contractionary theories that are being observed have led many to believe that the current universe was born from the death of the last universe . There is no end and there is no beginning . You are out of your league .
Actually , evolution occurs on the level of the population : individuals do n't change , but populations do . See the examples above .
So ? A city could just as easily ban all future sales of firearms to citizens without gun registration .
Could it partially be the fact that they do n't want antiquated belief system dogma making their decisions ? Must have access to a sonogram sounds like a lobby group attempting to sway opinion while enhancing revenue . Does the legislation force pregnant women who have not chosen abortion to have a sonogram ? Raising children creates post-delivery stress syndrome .
Really ? Then give me the definition of evolution . I 'm not asking for a statement of theory , or an example of evolution . What is the definition used by evolutionary biologists of evolution ? I suspect that you have n't studied evolution .
Because you people keep wanting one restriction after another after another after another . Nothing is ever good enough for you , you always want more than ever . Well we do n't want to abide by your wishes , gun ownership is a recognized right , and your hatred of rights wo n't be tolerated . We 're not going to just stand by and be painted as the bad guys because you have the mentally disabled belief that banning gun ownership will reduce crime , and anybody who disagrees with you want to see people killed .
Yippie doo ! A 23 year old quote from an ornithologist defending his point of view . And his point of view has ( or had ) merit . But since then , several feathered dinosaurs ( not birds ) have been found . It has also been shown that the difference between a scale and a feather may be no more than a single point mutation . ( You do know what I 'm talking about , do n't you Calli ? You do know what a `` point mutation '' is , do n't you ? ) Bottom line is that there may be no intermediate between scales and feathers . A single point mutation produces feathers from scales . Various kinds of feathers require only further mutation .
Nobody I know sanctions adultery . There are already serious consequences built in against it . As far a same sex marriage , I know of nobody that is suggesting legal penalties for it unless one considers the refusal to legally recognize it a legal penalty . Certainly nobody has been jailed or fined for attempting such marriages . Privately performed ceremonies as such are not punished .
Just a reminder , Belfrey : Do n't hold your breath ...
I think we should argue that it 's time to stop making people easy targets . The reason so many people are getting killed and victimized is because there are too many laws against self-defense , giving too much power to those that are fully intent on doing harm in an illegal manner .
Oh shut up ! You 're just sore because your side lost in the McDonald case and now you 're left with absolutely nothing . You know that many gun laws are going to fall to the sword of justice , and you just ca n't stand the fact that your side is going to be brought back into check , just like any other .
wonderful . Go read our decleration of independence . Maybe then you 'll see that everyone should be guarenteed life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . maybe then you 'll see every child aborted doesnt just lose its life , but also loses its destiny !
Object to the woman being required to remain pregnant when she does not want to be .
Try a new experience . Check these names from that list ; David Catchpoole , Emil Silvestru , Gary Parker , and Carl Wieland . I found them quickly - there are probably others like them who were once atheists , who became scientists , and subsequently creationists .
Actually , most people do not hold the view that existing marriages should be dissolved . In Massachussetts , it 's quite a minority view , almost as low as Bush 's approval rating . In any case , that is irrelevant . I was pointing out why someone might reasonably ask the question you consider so inappropriate . What I have n't seen , either from you or from any of the articles , was what the firefighter 's answer was or why he refused to answer . From what I can tell from the scant coverage , he avoided answering but had no trouble discussing his political views . Odd , I think.. or just crappy coverage .
Upon the case , and how far in she is . I will never believe in it , however my views upon what would happen AFTER she gave birth to the baby . If she was too deep , then I think that her baby should be taken away from her . However , if she could be saved , I think that she should go into therapy , and then only when she is defined to be past postpartum depression , may she be allowed the privilege of handling human life . Anything else would be too dangerous to her and the baby .
So now you 're freely and willingly admitting that you 'd take pleasure in inflicting pain and suffering on innocent people who have never done anything to you ? Good God ! No wonder you do n't like guns and want to see everyone disarmed !
You will never help the poor with a socialist system . The first casuality of a socialist state is the spirit of charity . The concept of charity in European societies does not exist , because it is the government job to the help the poor . Government officials just do n't strike me as being natural care givers . What then happens is you get a token `` official '' who pretends to give a rats pututie for carring about the poor , to make all the heartless people in a socialist state feel good that the government is doing something .
Well , where should we draw the line with men ? At what point is it OK for the government to take control rather than letting men make choices for their bodies ? For me . Nothing less than I ALWAYS MAKE MY OWN CHOICES FOR MY BODY is acceptable and anything else is violation .
The subject matter would be life forms . The units would depend on which particular aspect you were studying For instance to the question 'what units of measurement would you use for the effect of evolution ? I would say genetic changes that have patterns . ID would have that and more .
The only 'duty ' that any human being has with a parasite is to extract it as quickly as they can , if they chose to do so .
Well I think that the geology of the planet would influence everything . From religions to morals and scientific progression . Because long ago on our planet Europe not only thought the world was flat and they could fall over at the edge into an abyss but Europe generally did n't have knowledge of the Asian cultures until the silk road was active . If the asian and european cultures were not so greatly distanced from each other history would have been greatly changed to the extent that compared to our world would be pretty loopy
Well to be fair they do seem to have a problem distinguishing between armed and unarmed people . I recall an imigrant being shot 41 times with just some keys in his hand . Then there was the guy in the car shot while driving black .
Actually , for his hypothesis to explain the difference , he would have to say that the DNA changed . Even so , he assumes more .
Such personal attacks as yours indicate a bankruptcy of argument and reveal much about you while revealing nothing about me . If someone says that you are more likely to die in a car accident than in an airplane accident would accuse them of not caring about airplane accident victims ? Would you accuse them of taking delight in the number of car deaths ?
True , but I was referring to psychological explanations , not genuine reasons .
OMG SIMONE ! ! Can you believe a woman out there is against abortion ? This is why the `` walk a mile in my shoes '' fallacy fails everytime
U.S. Supreme Court PRESSER v. STATE OF ILLINOIS , 116 U.S. 252 ( 1886 )
No . I am saying . Privately owned guns serve the purpose of the militia , which is all citizens over 17 years of age . I am saying , a list of names and addresses do not serve any purpose of military readiness . My signature , yes it has no bearing on the Brady.org . I appologize for any confusion if anyone has interpreted as so . Your signature is about gun registration in a gun registration thread .
I believe this to be a cross between a religious issue and a social issue . you can not discuss the issue without discussing the religious , as well as social sides of it . so I wo n't try . I 'll talk about them all . And then I 'll tell you why I support a woman 's choice concerning her own body . One at a time ... question a ) what creatures have the right to live ? scientific answer : none . there is no `` right '' to life . Life advances and evolves according to natural selection , and the law that the strong survive and the weak are eaten , or else-wise deleted through some manifestation of their weakness . social answer : not applicable . humans are the only `` creatures '' who can belong to society , and therefore , obviously , only humans have the `` right '' to life . religious answer : any creature with a soul has the `` right '' to live . conclusion : the issue as it relates to this question is inherently a religious issue , because scientifically the question is null , and socially it has no meaning . question b ) when do these creatures get the right to live ? scientific answer : never . same reason as above . social answer : any creature who `` becomes '' human acquires the right to live . religious answer : any creature who acquires a soul acquires the right to live . conclusion : this time the issue is not only religious ; there is a combination of societal issues and religious issues which contribute to answering this question . no conclusion can really be made , yet , though the social answer leads to the obvious question : can a creature `` become '' human ? does a maturing fetus in the womb `` become '' human at some point ? or is it human from the moment of inception ? i argue for the former , though plenty of people will disagree . question c ) why do these creatures have the right to live at the time I give for question c : see my answers above . they are detailed . there is a very , very , very very VERY major question which you completely glossed over , and which is very very VERY pertinent to the issue . i raised this question to a short extent in the conclusion for question b. i 'll call it `` question d ) '' question d : at what point does a creature become human ? obviously , this question is debatable . my personal opinion is that a creature ( a fetus ) becomes human at such time as it could live with minimal medical assistance outside of the mother 's womb . this contributes to my further opinion that the larger issue is predominantly a religious one , because with the answer to this question i remove the only reason which would oppose me to abortion prior to the time of capability of self-sustainment . on the other hand , there are others who are not religious , who are against abortion . always , these are the people who answer this last question differently than me . always , these are the people who believe that from the time of conception , a fetus is in fact a human being . i can not argue with their reasoning ; it makes every bit as much sense as mine . from a purely physical standpoint , it makes even more sense . yet i stand by my point of view . i submit , though , that if you want to exclude religion from the discussion , this is the only truly debatable point about abortion whatsoever . anything else is religion . and that 's a whole other can of worms .
end where ? ambiguously phrased . if `` here '' = '' death '' , then yes ! by definition , yes !
We do . And you are on a school board and you spout creationist **** like that ?
Well , your reasoning is certainly muddled , and it seems to be confused with some sort of twisted socio-political agenda , but I do n't think I would characterize your piece a filthy collage . But you can call you stuff what you want .
So long as they do not contain my DNA , yes .
Right . The frenquecy of the alles have changed over time .
Oh my , but is n't you 're whole endeavor to say that life has a small p-value , therefore could not have possible arisen by chance . I just happen to dispute the low p-value of life arising . Not only do evolutionists usually not accept a low p-value for life forming , we Pastafarians also do not accept it , since we know that there is 100 % chance of the FSM creating life with His Noodly Appendage . Then he starts equating the Bible Code ( which has been debunked , I mean seriously debunked , start here ) . In my mind , if the Isaac Newton of Information Theory says , `` At the same time that research in the Bible Code has taken off , research in a seemingly unrelated field has taken off as well , namely , biological design . These two fields are in fact closely related ... The relevant statistical methodology is identical for both fields , '' and I say that if one of those methodologies has been debunked , then so has the other . I think William Demski and other founding fathers of ID creationism are the movement 's worst enemies . They contradict themselves repeatedly and usually their words can easily be used against them to refute or debunk ID itself , and I do n't mean by quote mining or any other creationist tactic . On one hand there is Michael Behe , who under oath claimed that in order for ID to fit a definition of science , that definition also had to be broad enough to include astrology , and on the other hand there is William Demski , who claims that ID and the Bible Code follow the same statistical methodology and are very closely related . To me , it looks like these guys should be telling fortunes , not lobbying school boards . Well , I do suppose they are mostly sticking to selling books and lecturing for $ 200 an hour , so you 've got to give them credit for keeping up the sham for so long . I 'd really love it if someone got on this board and tried to defend the Bible Code or William Demksi 's apparent endorsement of it .
And the mall plainly had `` no guns allowed '' signs displayed at all the entrances , meaning the shooter broke the law when he brought his gun in and started shooting . Now , find me a school massacre that took place where concealed carry is actually legal on campus .
This can only be plausible if the victims were killed before they reproduced . But , still evolutionary psychology is tenously at best called `` science . '' Just as most of psychology IMO is barely science , if at all .
How about the simplistic explanation that people and other organisms have inhabitated the area since the Dinosaurs died ? If you bothered to read your own article :
And if a cell has been fertilized , is it a person ?
And here is another old standby-Theistic evolutionists do not exist . They are either confused Christians who are losing their faith , or they are lying atheists . So , E. Mutz , Jo Bennett , which are you ? Lost christians or lying atheists ?
Oh dear , deluded philisopher nutter alert . No one can empirically prove anything . Fact . End of discussion .
Oh it 's no mistake Montalban . I , unlike you , am quite clear in my arguments , and have a direction and a goal . We can take your other definitions of creationism one at a time , thank you very much . I 'd like to first focus on the one that involves your god , or any god , described as being unknowable ( which you have said your god is ) . Will you `` allow '' us to focus on ONE thing ? You see , if we have a list of 4 things , and we go through them one by one , we can maybe arrive at the end ! ! ! Crazy thought is n't it !
I think many things are getting confused here . First , I have no idea what moral maturity means . You talk as though that is some definable entity . Next , one may reasonably consider that children are cognitively different from adults . Despite what society or 5 judges have to say , that seems to me a valid reason for applying different sentences to different people . The question was raised with respect to the death penalty as well . We are not talking about criteria for guilt , but once convicted , we are talking about whether to execute a person or not . Unless you feel that punishment should be based solely on retribution , I think there is some wiggle room for different sentencing guidelines for different aged humans . You have conceded that a difference in neurophysiologic fitness makes sense , but we should decide on a case by case basis . If you can figure out a reliable way to do that , go for it . We draw the line based upon age all the time for all sorts of things . The issue of abortion is different for many reasons . We are not deciding on whether to execute a person based upon a crime they committed . That makes it a different issue . Ideally , we would never have a pregnant young woman under the age of 18 make a decision like that without the support and guidance of her loving parents . The ideal situation sometimes does not exist . An underage female may legally make this decision precisely because there are many out there who do not have that guidance at all or informing parents would make things worse . It just so happens that females are fertile prior to 18 , so we do not have the luxury of applying similar age requirements . If you could ban pregnancy prior to 18 , now youd be talking .
I need to pick you up on this as IC has never been identified . As such you can not use it to 'prove ' something incorrect . I will respond to your other points but my wife insist I turn the laptop off ... ..
The bible is not a science textbook . I do not treat it as such .
Why , if one wants to have an abortion , should one be FORCED to view a sonogram ?
You are correct , but contingency must be in place to deal with it when it occurs . Look at what happened in Eire with `` Case X '' in 1992- what happens when a country with the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe has to face up to the issue of pregnacy as a consequence of rape : http : //www.prochoiceforum.org.uk/ireland6.asp Pages 12-13 of this EU report ( Adobe Acrobat reader required ) : http : //www.newr.bham.ac.uk/pdfs/Repr ... m % 20Bremen.pdf
Oh , yes : they often say that sin and evil should exist because of free will , but they also condemn Eve for eating the apple . So , did Eve do the right thing ? Of course , I do n't believe that there was an Eden as described in the bible , but that wo n't stop me from showing that it is inconsistant .
`` common sense '' what makes your common sense better then mine ? how do you know your common sense is correct ? common sense is relative , not absolute .
So which came first ? The liquor or the egg ?
But they consider the exact same thing inside a human that has yet to be implanted a pregnancy ? Double standards much ?
That 's like asking why do you get to choose what to do with your own hair or teeth , because it is part of YOUR body . Men have this right . Women have this same right .
did you miss the part where it is ... the attempt to abort . which kills the women . it is not child birth that kills those women . it is an attempt to abort . if they didnt try and kill their baby.. they would not of died . Having a child , is not a trajedy ... its just part of life . its not a wrongful burden ... or a flaw of existance.. its nature . dah ... do you even read what is being posted ?
Ho , hum ... humanist , atheistic babble that does nothing but keep you running in circles , thinking you are actually getting somewhere .
The California judge would probably not have the authority to refer to the Federal Constitution ; it would have to be taken to the Federal Courts for that .
I hope I have already begun to change your mind .
Well , I can more easily explain what it is NOT . In my latter ID days , I was arguing for a form of Directed Panspermia , with the aliens themselves having arisen by purely natural means - starting off as simpler organisms than us , but then evolving intelligence - and then creating life as we know it . Without getting into details , imagine what we humans will probably due in 100 years or so : create a new form of life ( robotic ) that is vastly different than our own and probably more complex . And it is a form of life we would be more likely to send out into space than ourselves , and that is better suited for being send out to other planets than we are . Analogously , imagine a form of alien life unlike that as we know it creating bacterial life and then sending it out in spaceships to populate other worlds . With our form of life being designed by a different form of life and rocketed here , that would be intelligent design of life as we know it . However , that is NOT what the ID movement holds ID to be : their 's is a religious position down to its core , as became even more clear in the Dover , PA court case . Also , one could argue that Intelligent Design is a fact . When humans create a novel amino acid sequence , or modify a bacterium to perform a specific target function , then we are practicing intelligent design in biology . But that is NOT what the ID movement means . Theirs is a religious position that uses human design as an analogy , not as their goal . As far as Behe 's ID , he made it clear in his Darwins ' Black Box and in court in the Dover , PA case that he ca n't say much of anything about ID . He ca n't tell WHEN the designs were created , HOW the designs were instantiated , by WHOM or `` WHOMS '' the designs were created , or WHERE the designs and instantiations occurred . He 's got 0 details . Yet he rejects evolution - despite the tons of evidence - because not every single I has been dotted in the origin of the bacterial flagellum . Behe strains out a gnat yet swallows a camel .
So do I , but my reasoning is highly speculative , even by my own standards .
No , they do not . I know several people in England who posess weapons the bought on the street . How are the gun laws in england working when you can buy a machine gun ? Before the ban , england had lower numbers when it came to firearms related deaths . They also had lower crime numbers . The sociological differences between England and the United States are not be be discounted . It is interesting to note that crime rates in England seem to be rising now that the gun ban has been around for a while . There is even a movement by public officials to arm police officers in response to the rising rate of violent crime . There isa n article and debate about it right here on the forums . The biggest difference lately in the statistics in England in the US is not the numbers , it is how they are recorded . If a guy is confronted by three people outside a bar and shot to death , but the gus get off during trial , it is still recorded in America s a three person homocide . In england , it is NOT recorded . I get the London Times , and they have done several articles accusing th British government of manipulating crime figures . I think that if we in America only recorded solved crimes in our crime statistics , we might become one of the most cime free contries in the world !
Nor does the fact that he was a Christian prove all Christianity is wrong .
On what that drugs and alchohol are not moral equivelants to being gay ?
Perhaps I can help :
So when you 're doing math , you 're an atheist ? Of course not . Just because there is overlap does n't mean that the two views are identical .
** This much you got right .
So although you provide absolutely no evidence or source to back up this claim we should just accept that the memo is authentic until some disproves it ? How does such reasoning even begin to make sense ? I 'm very suspicious about the legitimacy of such a memo . Here are two bogus quotes attributed to Sarah Brady by some people on the pro-gun side :
Darwinian natural selection is n't opposed to Christianity . In fact , if you took the time to inform yourself you would find that Christian organizations like the ICR and AIG both clearly state that natural selection is a reality and consider it foolish to deny it . In fact , young earth creationists propose evolution by means of natural selection at rates that boggle the minds of evolutionary biologists . They reason that the millions of species of animals that we know of today evolved in very few years after the flood of Noah from the few thousand `` kinds '' that were aboard the ark . I think that you have confused one of Darwin 's theories with the modern biological theory of evolution . It seems that you are n't aware of the fact that Darwin was not the first scientist to state a theory of evolution . Darwin merely restated the simple idea that populations of animals are observed to change over time , an old idea that was accepted by many naturalists of the day . In fact , even Darwin 's grandfather wrote about evolution . By the time Darwin sailed on the Beagle , evolution was an old idea and by the time Darwin published On the Origin of Species the idea was 28 years older . Darwin proposed a mechanism of evolution , which is why his idea gained such wide acceptance almost immediately . What Darwin 's theory lacked was a mechanism of heredity by which novel characteristics were able to remain in a population and not be overwhelmed by majority of the population that lacked that characteristic . None of the theories of heredity of Darwin 's day could account for the origin and increase of new characteristics in a population . That was the greatest challenge to `` Darwinism '' until the early decades of the 20th century when Mendel 's work was rediscovered .
Oh well thats tough hat to victims of rape then . Somehow I doubt this will survive legal challenges , assuming Gov.Rounds actually signs the Bill .
All forms of life ? Animal life ? Plant life ? The mold growing in your bathroom ?
What has this got to do with the non-material world , of which God and you and I are a part of ? I know that the Apostles witnessed God 's miracles . I too am witness to God 's miracles . The evidence is adequate for me and for much of the world 's population ... even many scientists ( including evolutionists ) . You are in a loud minority , railing against the irrational hoards about you .
Actually , I think that lack of support for your mythology is one of the reasons that it is n't accepted as literal . I suspect that your documentation is just assertion that you believe because it tells you what you want to hear . Why is it that creationists keep claining to have `` proof '' and never present any ? Have you checked out the threads in the Religion forum where some posters are having trouble demonstrating the historicity of Jesus ? How can you claim documentation for Adam & amp ; Eve , the Garden , talking snake , the flood ?
And this : `` Speak up for those who can not speak for themselves ; ensure justice for those who are perishing . '' Proverbs 31:8Also ... Exodus 21 22 `` If men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury , the offender must be fined whatever the woman 's husband demands and the court allows . 23 But if there is serious injury , you are to take life for life , 24 eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot , 25 burn for burn , wound for wound , bruise for bruise . 1 ) If a woman gives birth prematurely , but there is no serious injury -- i.e . the baby lives without harm , then a fine results to compensate for the assault . 2 ) If a woman gives birth prematurely , and the baby dies , then the assailant is to be given the death penalty . This point is HUGE ! ! ! What God is saying here is that the value and worth of an adult man is equal to the value and worth of an unborn fetus who was young enough , or injured enough , to die . God equates the loss of an unborn baby as the loss of a life , for He says , `` you are to take life for life , ... '' This point can not be emphasized too strongly . God considers the unborn baby alive , and the loss of that life is considered murder . This murder is punishable with the death penalty . This verse demonstrates three truths : a ) The unborn 's life is equivalent in value to an adult 's life in God 's sight b ) This also outlines God 's Law against criminal feticide . c ) The killing of the unborn is murder Bible and abortion : The Biblical case against abortion
Well , the claim is n't that they were identical , just that they preceded Jesus and were very similar .
That 's ridiculous . The purpose imposed by man is what makes it artificial in the first place . You have the idea expressed in the definition backwards . It is n't that natural selection operates on the same principles as artificial selection , but the reverse . The principles are that differential reproductive success will have an effect on the gene pool of the species .
This obviously depends on the person . Both are not good ... once again , a comparision is not gon na work . Whether you are an alcoholic or a weed-a-holic ( not a real word ) you will still mess up your health ( which is a good reason we should n't have public health care ) .
I fail to see where I broke any of those rules , no names were called , there was no labeling , there was no none of it . And even if there was , you do it all the time , so what makes you any different . Practice what you preach Penfold .
Yes . Only the ignorant think not .
Oh , really , pregnancy is not expensive ? Have you gone through a pregnancy ? I talked with numerous friends who went through pregnancies , and the costs were astonishing - from the doctor visits , to the actual delivery which can cost well into the thousands ( tens of thousands if there are difficulties with the birth ) . Just the visit I made shortly before getting an abortion was expensive . As for adoption , there very well may be no cost in the actual procedure- but there certainly are numerous costs - both monetarily and physically- before it . If you think otherwise , you are sadly mistaken .
Reasonable gun regulation is an oxymoron like military intelligence . You mean like Bill Ayers ( sic ) and his wife or Carl Rowen ? Wait my bad they are n't from the right .
Yes . I believe it 's a matter of personal individual freedom . If purchased legally , and not used to commit a crime , what harm comes from handgun ownership ? I do n't own one , but I own many other guns . If they can ban handguns , what 's to stop them from banning shotguns , or even BB guns ? I do n't believe in a nanny state , taking away my toys `` for my own good '' . Waxy
Well I heard it was a big concern in la amoing gang circles as the drive by was becoming `` cowardice '' . So there was a movment by both the bloods and crips to each lead charges by bayonet .
Actually , if you bothered to pay any attention whatsoever , it actually goes against your point entirely . Just because WSM and I were both in `` heterosexual '' Style relationships , does n't change the fact that both of us are indeed homosexuals and therefore proves that homosexuals do indeed have children , planned or not . Mine too was kind of a suprise . I was on the `` pill '' but was also taking antibiotics at the time and for anyone who does n't already know , antibiotics will completely cancel out the affects of the birth control pill . I was NOT aware of this at the time and low-and-behold I ended up pregnant with my son . p.s . just for general information , I was not taking `` the pill '' for birth control reasons . Not all women who are prescribed it are even sexually active at all . The birth control pill contains synthetic or naturally dirived female hormones , which for some women aids them in attaining a more regular period . Many women atheletes are prescribed birth control because being extremely athletic can disrupt , postpone or completely do away with a woman 's natural cycle . Taking birth control helps to `` normalize '' female hormone levels . Such was my case .
He was at various different observatories . I 've never heard of Mt . Carmel . He worked at Lick and Palomar . ( Wait I think Lick is on Mt . Carmel maybe ? ) Who cares . When and where was he BARRED from using these telescopes ? Please provide a link . When and where was he BARRED from presenting his evidence ? Please provide a link . He published plenty of papers and he even has websites and books . But , he only had a few images supporting his hypohtesis that quasars are ejecta from odd galaxies . They also had many various doubts associated with them . If he had presented hundreds of examples of these things that had no other explanation they would have taken it more seriously ( not that these things were n't taken seriously since they were ) . He did n't . No one else has come across these things other than one or two that I am aware of , and these are also explained away . He was n't fired for just suggesting that the BB was wrong . If so he would have been fired in the sixties . I do n't even think he was fired but I have n't found info on this . I found this page though : http : //www.astroleague.org/al/obsclu ... c/arphalt.html
And for good reason . Electrical engineers in general have a pretty poor track record when discussing issues that have nothing to do with ... electrical engineering . Examples : Walter ReMine , Fred Williams , etc .
So even though you can legally conceal carry right up to the gate of the national parks , and you can legally hunt within the parks , somehow concealed carry in the parks will become more dangerous ?
So , you do n't see how stating that in a functioning democratic society guns belong only in the hands of the state is not anti gun ? ? Maybe you could give us an example of a statement that is more anti gun that that because I am having trouble imagining one .
And ? ? ? What is the question ? So none of the conditions that I mentioned and maybe some that I did n't even have the knowledge to consider do n't exist in a zoo . And yet , I have some doubts about the survival of an animal in +100 degree temperatures when it is adapted to an environment where 50 degrees is hot , and -30 is common .
I think you missed the point of what I was saying
Well sigma , which is more painful ? ? Being burnt with salene for 30 minutes to an hour and if that doesnt work after the 3rd time , being born prematurally and laid on a table and starving to death ... .. OR A woman sticking a clothes hanger up and accidentally killing herself but intentionally killing the kid within her ? seems to me that people dont really care about how the baby feels . It has just as much feeling as the mother .
Does this seem a little ironic to anyone else ? Either becoming intoxicated is acceptable or it is n't , why does the method make one acceptable and practitioners of the other `` losers '' ? For the record I do n't drink , smoke or partake of illegal drugs .
I know I have told you this before but a trimester has no science meaning in it at all . It is simply just a term to say `` 3 months '' . I 'm not sure how a man-made time split can be used to determine who is an isnt ' a person ... but maybe you can explain this .
What should be practical in society is the criminal element being scared to death that they 're going to be killed at the very next house they try and rob . That 's not only practical , it 's moral . If you do n't want to die , do n't break the law . It 's not rocket science , all you need to do is stop being bad .
You would do yourself a favour to drop it permanently . Nobody who understands the second law of thermodynamics believes it precludes the possibility of complexity increasing at a given place .
Since when ? So if I were to post a news article where someone says that pedophilia should be legalized , then it means I agree with them ? I thought this was a discussion board . That means we , you know , DISCUSS THINGS . Now , if I had said `` Here is AiG 's article and I could n't agree with them more '' , then you would have an argument . As I did not , you do n't . Now , do you retract your false statement that what you quoted was my reasoning ?
So you support allowing a 10 y/o to buy an Uzi and carry it into a federal court house or school as long as he does not commit a crime ? Wow . And your logic about taking criminals off the street and then having no gun control concerns would be perfect ... if we had a finite number of criminals . We do n't . New murderers and theives and carjackers and dope dealers and bank robbers and child rapists are born every day .
So taking away all their guns would have been better ? The ruling party was certainly well armed how about the other parties ?
Well I 'm glad its no problem for your son . No child deserves to be harrassed .
Just to add more fuel on the fire : P
So , which is it ? You do n't want violators of Federal law to have guns , yet you do n't want them to get rid of them either . Ca n't possibly do both , now can you ? Which one ? Do the law breakers keep them , or not ? Make it against the law to keep the guns ... now make it against the law to sell them . DUH ! I guess we 'll just hang out in limbo-land !
5-6 days
Just like evolution was n't supposed to be used to show that fundamentalism is wrong ? Despite my claims that logic is a better tool for refuting fundamentalism , evolution is perceived as the big `` threat . ''
So , your saying an eyewitness would mean nothing . Yeah right .
That analogy does n't work here . It appears that your beef is with the prestige associated with being able to say `` We 're married . '' as opposed to recognizing yourselves as `` same-sex couples with all the rights and privileges afforded married couples '' . The fact is that people are not prohibited from being married because of their sexual orientation . A gay man can marry any woman that will have him . A lesbian can marry any man that will have her . You are not denied the right to marry ... so long as you comply with the rules of marriage ... including the one about one male and one female . Changing definitions just to satisfy the ego of any one group is patently ridiculous . One might ask why we ca n't call ourselves female when we are actually male or why males should n't be allowed to enroll in an all girls school . If it benefits you want , have at it . Work on Congress to come up with something like PACS . If it 's an attack on the definition of marriage , then get lost .
Prove it then . If this is a fact , there will be research on the subject on the net somewhere comparing the effects of the two . In terms of addiction , alcohol is far worse than pot apparently . http : //www.tfy.drugsense.org/tfy/addictvn.htm
Try googling it .
It 's NOT any of my business , but when presenting information to the readers at large , such topics need to be # # # # ing addressed , something militant pro-abortionist seldom want to bring up . I 'm actually happy that you had a good operation and think more should go into ensuring ALL women have the same low risk proceedures when necessary . We 're dealing with health aspects , all , not just selective . And there may even be things I 'm not aware about to consider .
If anyone was going to use the argument that our bodies are flawed to prove that God does n't exist , that would be a debate that could be won . No one would debate that our bodies were made all that well although it is amazing that life could have started at just a single cell and worked it 's way up to where it is today . So either God did a poor job or evolution did an absolutely spectacular job . Just how did evolution know that light existed and that it could be seen before creating the eye ? How do we know that there are not many other senses that exist which evolution will show us one day ?
Yes . But that means that the cat `` kind '' , a single pair , produced 4 genera with 36 species in , at most , a couple hundred years . And that does n't even include domestic cats . It makes the head of any evolutionary biologist spin ! Creationists who wish to deny evolution invoke hyperevolution for thousands of `` kinds '' to yield millions of species in hundreds of years . And yet , they deny evolution .
No , the issue is about civil rights . You just do n't want to publicly oppose civil rights , so you jump through hoops to try to call the issue something else . The government is giving out perks and bennies , and has arbitrarily decided to exclude one group from qualifiying , even though they meet all meaningful qualificaitons . It 's that simple ; even you see it . Look at what you said above . Not `` getting married '' is a civil right . `` changing marriage '' . Whenever you dance so prettily it 's clear that you know where the landmines are , and are desperately trying to avoid them .
And I suspect WW understands it about as well as you do ...
It is much more important that you concern yourself with the destiny of your soul , not how many years you can stay on the earth .
Actually , submitting samples that will return bogus dates is dishonest . Creationists have done this several times .
You think its bad now ? Watch what happens if Gov't takes control . I saw a great tagline the other day , it said `` If the US get socialized medicine where will Canadians get healthcare ? '' Anyone who does n't like insurance premiums is free not to pay them , at least until the gov't takes over . Happy New Year
Ditto squared . If they support killing a perfectly healthy unborn child , they will argue that the reason stated in the Op is the main reason Abortion is needed and justified . And I must say that if 98 % of all abortions were performed for that reason , the public stance against them might not be so strong .
But is the Red Cross Christian ? Obviously most contributors are Christian . That 's obvious as most Americans are Christian .
not bad for a procedure that does n't exist .

Of course evolutionists want to remove any possible religious connotation from evolutionary teaching . Evolution is n't science and to introduce religion has been found unconstitutional several times . And you are actually on a school board making decisions about what children are taught ? How sad .
Actually , I snipped your remarks because 1 ) you twisted what I said and 2 ) I 'm already spending too much time arguing with random complainers and I was in a hurry to do something more important at the time .
I 'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you , but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species . The Canid species , specifically the Gray Wolf , or the Canis lupus which the domesticated dog is an extremely close relative of , differing from it by at most 0.2 % of mtDNA sequence . The evolution of the domestic dog The earliest remains of the domestic dog date from 10 to15 thousand years ago21 ; the diversity of these remains suggests multiple domestication events at different times and places . Dogs may be derived from several different ancestral gray wolf populations , and many dog breeds and wild wolf populations must be analysed in order to tease apart the genetic sources of the domestic dog gene pool . A limited mtDNA restriction fragment analysis of seven dog breeds and 26 gray wolf populations from different locations around the world has shown that the genotypes of dogs and wolves are either identical or differ by the loss or gain of only one or two restriction sites22 . The domestic dog is an extremely close relative of the gray wolf , differing from it by at most 0.2 % of mtDNA sequence . In comparrison , the gray wolf differs from its closest wild relative , the coyote , by about 4 % of mitochondrial DNA sequence14 ( Fig . 4 ) . Therefore , the molecular genetic evidence does not support theories that domestic dogs arose from jackal ancestors24 . Dogs are gray wolves , despite their diversity in size and proportion ; the wide variation in their adult morphology probably results from simple changes in developmental rate and timing 25 . Link to source site : http : //www.idir.net/~wolf2dog/wayne2.htm Here 's a lineage graph : http : //www.idir.net/~wolf2dog/images/W2FIG4.gif And what fossil records can you show that one species of animal has evolved into another species of animal ?
i 'm impressed ! this is a very precise description , in regular english and yes , the deduction in 9 seems presumptious if all we state is God has a `` possibility of existence '' . how this was cleverly cleared up ( from the same source site ) was simply a trip back to the definition : `` greatest possible being '' . the `` greatest possible being '' , by definition , MUST have a possible existence . in otherwords , we can not assume that there is a possibility that the greatest possible being does not exist . yeah , it sounds like the whole `` proof '' is pointless because your premise is already the proof just keep in mind that for the purposes of this proof , God is defined as `` the greatest being possible '' . as long as that definition is maintained , the proof works ... does that mean that God exists ? hmmm ... .
This is different than stating that abortion is the same , in principle , as killing a born child . We are back on the question of `` Why would someone do this horrible thing '' which pro-life people continually ask and has been answered in many ways by many people . There are many threads on the subject That the fetus did not come into existance by it 's own choice is really irrelevant . That it did not cause problems of it 's own actions does not mean that it does not cause problems .
Should all drivers have to help pay for harm done by irresponsible drivers ?
Is that a trick question ? No , the tabloid and other gutter press keep going on about how bad it is , because they sell papers by fanning fear and hatred , and fear of crime is one of their biggest markets . Yes there has been an increase in gun crime over the years , but that 's largely attributable to increased attractiveness of crime in a society where social mobility has come to a standstill . In any case the number of incidents where firearms are used in crime is still very small , which is why every time someone gets shot it is headline news . Guns are incredibly rare in this country , the only time I 've seen guns in real life ( other than air rifles ) is on a military base .
Well , certainly I do n't expect to change the minds of millions of Americans , and that is not my goal . My goal is to convince readers of my writing that Americans SHOULD agree with same-sex marriage because it is morally correct to do so .
Many of the Christian denominations are ignoring them the same way they ignore the prohibitions against pork , mixed cloth , and stoning your children to death because they sass you .
The fact that they were too heavy , is simply untrue , see previous post . Hunting depends on many ecological factors , such as their predational preference . Also new fossils suggest a trees down development of bird flight so fully developed flight muscles and feathers were not necessary .
And you people whine at me about using personal insults ( ) ... anyhow , once a fetus is eight months , I believe , they are fully developed and ready for a premature birth . I was born prematurely , so do n't tell me it does n't happen . So if you get an abortion at eight months , you 're not killing a fetus , you 're killing a baby .
Or could it be possible that God , as the sovereign and just Creator of the universe , through his divine will , could have orchestrated the world in such a way , that there was not one pregnant person on the earth during this time period ?
Okay . The best succinct representation of the scientific method is probably circular : We make an observation about what we see . We form a hypothesis based on our observation . We perform an experiment to test the hypothesis . We make an observation about what we see ( in the experiment ) . Rinse and repeat ... Now add a spur : after repeated refinement and confirmation of hypotheses , a theory is devised .
That is an interesting point- from what I have read of ID there are a number of tenants it does not oppose ( a good example being a very old earth/universe ) that would instantly put it at irreconcilable loggerheads to YECism . IMO ID its the ultimate god-of-the-gaps outlook- it follows modern scientific understanding in certain well established areas and then invokes the `` our understanding ends here , this is where god is '' clause . It is certainly more cerebral than the blatant YEC pseudoscience but on one level at least ( God has had and continues to have a direct hand in shaping the universe and all the is within it ) it is just the same . Oh and :
You seem to be arguing that a corpse is a human .
Do you have to work at becoming so scientifically illiterate ? What ever happened to the creationist chant about evolution being a product of pure chance ? You seem to chant all of the other creationist tripe .
President Obama ! ? What did I win ! ?
It 's not a theme park . It is a museum similar to the Natural History Museum in London , the only difference being that they take a Biblical stance of our origins rather than an evolutionary view .
'Self-defense ' never enters into it , imo . Unwillingness to share ones body is not necessarily self-defense , so this does not apply .
Another slimy attempt by you to misrepresent my position . Of course eight children being murdered is a horrible tragedy but statistically it does n't tell us anything . You and your comrades might want to educate yourselves about the meaning of `` statistical significance '' before responding .
Really ? I have not seen one coherent idea from both of them combined .
I think that with only a little bit of thought , your objections can be dismissed as unworthy , anti-scientific dissembling that does n't take scientific reality into account -- probably in order to advance a religious agenda !
Actually false assumptions can sound quite pleasant . For example : there will be peace in the world . The vile comments you embrace are not ugly because they are supposedly false , but because they treat human life in a contemptuous and arrogant manner , in the context of destroying that life . You can behave with as little class as you want over the internet , but it shows a lot of cowardice since I bet you would n't be so prickly face to face with other people .
And how do you define 'sin , ' Sandycane ?
yes , on the grounds of `` mostly likely '' we can make reasonable assumptions . but we must still treat them as such . part of the catch of God 's existence is that no evidence of his existence cn ever be found . if Jesus actually physically performed observable miracles , even 2000 years ago , then it would surely proven that the supernatural can and does ( or did ) exist in reality . however , even jesus 's ministry contradicts the faith theory . how can God expect faith from those who have n't observed on the grounds of those who have ? if people can observe the manifested power of God in reality , then they have physical evidence that God exists . but this conflicts with the nature of God from a biblical standpoint . in other words , the bible can not claim that physical evidence for the existence of God can exist , and then that it can not exist , without contradicting itself . what we end up with is the predicament that ANY physical evidence that could possibly support God 's existence is evidence against God 's existence ( at least from a biblical standpoint )
Notice how doctors determine if the body is empty . Electrocardiogram or Electroencephlogram ( looking for life force/electricity/energy )
You know something is wrong with this world when people attack the act of posting an opinion ( that of Ms. King ) and another condemns the idea that someone may read it and develop their own opinion . Saving lives is not just a Republican goal . And yes it is an act of desperation . All acts are an act of desperation when it comes to saving the natural process of life with out interference of those who place their comfort above the life inside them . Whatever is wrong outside the womb , is not the fault of the inhabitant within the womb .
How about people who do n't live in a well-developed country ? They ca n't get treatment for all of their diseases .
Nah , it is a gateway in the fact that herion addicts and crack addicts are in the same room and are the same friends of yours that supply the marijuana . Would legalization help this ? I dunno , but probably cause many other problems without everyone legalizing it .
Why either of those ?
Oh deary me , no . Where do I even start ? The bacteria and enzymes in your gut and intestinal tract that digest food are every bit as microscopic , and they thrive on specific compounds , not elements . Sugars and fats are plain old carbon , hydrogen and oxygen . You could get exactly the same atoms into your body by drinking water and eating graphite - and you 'd die . Can you digest cellulose ? No - but other animals can , because they have enzymes that can break it down . It 's still all just carbon , oxygen and hydrogen - but that 's like saying everybody 's front door key is just 'brass ' . It is n't the fact that it 's brass that unlocks your door , it 's the shape it 's formed into
We need to ban box cutters . We need to ban box cutter shows . We need to prohibit box cutters on school campus . We need to to ban extra efficient assault box cutters because the can open more boxes than regular boxes . We need to register all box cutters . We need to reduce the box cutter supply to prevent box cutters from getting to criminals . Regular people do n't need box cutters , they can just use pointy sticks to cut tape on boxes . Did you notice . They did not use guns . Terrorist in our country used box cutters and fertilizer and U-hauls to kill people . We need to ban fertilizer and U-hauls ... ... ...
Misleading : having complex eyes in trilobites in no way contradicts evolution . 1 ) Evolution holds that primitive eyespots predated the Cambrian explosion ( probably in a small , simple worm of some sort and worm tracks have been found in pre-Cambrian strata ) . This is based on genetic evidence such as the universality across quite diverse animal phyla of Pax and other regulatory genes involved in the development of visual systems in extant animals . 2 ) We know of extant organisms simpler than trilobites that have simpler visual systems , such as some algae , sponge larvae , the unicellular Euglena , and some jelly fish , all of which use photoreceptors for phototaxis . Evolutionary theory holds that these simpler organisms - with their pre-visual photoreceptors - arose prior to triolobites .
It is horribly oppressive of women , though , to oppose both abortion and contraceptives . That means that women will have no control over their pregnancies at all .
And if you 've ever read any of the speeches by PP 's founder , you 'd also know that every child should be a WHITE CHILD , too . She was an extreme racist and started PP as a means of stopping the increasing number of poor blacks . There was no altruism involved in PP 's `` birth '' .
This question is premised on an untenable assumption : that people should not be allowed to vote on particular issues . This premise is clearly not true in any democratic society , and is especially not true in the United States . In the United States , it is a contradiction in terms to say someone is not allowed to vote on X. I have demonstrated this before , and yet the same silly question keeps coming up .
Exactly where it is from . Great movie .
Do you mean someone who was wrong ? I asked you before to give an example of where Newton found empirical evidence of God . You failed to do so . I suspect that you ca n't .
And if left to market forces they can charge whatever they want .
Well memory is NOT something that is immaterial is it . Its always implemented in the form of material processes well known to biochemistry . Metabolism , ion flows , neuron activity and interconnections , along with potentiation of those connections into networks . Free-will of course is what we call the experience of our choices being not wholly determined by external states alone . By no means does that exclude the fact that our internal states ( of which we are largely ignorant ) also play a role . The autonomy arises from the operation of the brain and those internal states . Again a purely materialist explanation . And there is no evidence of anything other than material processes in the experience of free-will . In other words neither memory nor free-will require a non-materialist viewpoint .
This past Saturday , my partner and I had a commitment ceremony or wedding if you say care to say ... ..In my state it is not legally bindingm we did it anyway ... ..it was more about the emotional commitment two people make to each other in the presence of their friends and family . I tried so hard not to , but when the celebrant asked me to repeat after him , with the vows I wrote my self ... ..I tried and tried and tried , but could n't speak . I was too moved by the moment and all I could do was cry ... . I love my partner with all my heart ... .So I wanted to get through , I thought about our taxes ( did n't work ) . So thought about everyone in their underware ... ..contrary to popular opinoin that does n't work either ... .. I managed to get the words out ( do n't know how ) just did ! This marriage is just as perfect to us , and those that were our witnessess ... ..as any heterosexual wedding ... ... The rest of the night was blur , between 50 people wanting my attention and me being really buzzed on white wine ... ..oh my oh my ... ... .I was pretty shocked ! Marrige is what you decide it is , regardles if the gov was to see it ... .I am now married ... ..like it or not .
What this highlights is that the laws of the land are ignored and some people try to place the blame on the victims .
I think you sound rather immature . And actually , it 's tough luck for you , Chuzlife . Because the law is not on your side . And I doubt women who are exercising their Constitutional rights are going to tell you about what 's going on with their bodies or within their privacy of their relationships with their physicians and/or family members . Nor do I blame them one bit . And just to clarify your position for the board , on this `` child '' definition you keep insisting on . Do you mean to use that terminology for a fertilized egg , too ? As in the photograph I shared earlier ? : flutteringeyelashes :
You keep starting all these threads on gays , that & # 8217 ; s called obsession .
You mean Priests ? Because I hear the ladies are crawling all over them , ca n't get enough of that catholic loving ...
That was ... interesting .
And Daley fought harder than anyone to keep it in place . What 's your point ?
And the moon could fall from the sky , too .
Actually , you have been lied to here from my knowledge . The fossil record does not show `` in-between types '' . Darwin said that the absence of such intermediates was the `` most obvious and serious objection '' against his theory . Nearly 150 years later , Dr David Raup , the head of one of the great museums in America , said that the situation concerning missing links `` has n't changed much '' and that `` we have even fewer examples of evolutionary transition than we had in Darwins times . '' The Late Dr Colin Patterson was Senior Paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History as well an being an evolutionist and a fossil expert . He wrote a significant book on evolution - but when someone asked him why he did not show any pictures of in-between forms in his book , he wrote the following : `` I fully agree with your comments on the lack of direct illustration of evolutinoary transitinos in my book . If I knew of any , fossil or living , I would certainly have included them . You suggest that an artist should be used to visualise such transformations , but where would he get the informatino from ? I could not , honestly , provide it , and if I were to leave it to artistic licence , would htat not mislead the reader ? I wrote the text of my book four years ago [ in the book he does talk of his belief in some transitions - my dialogue ] . If I were to write it now , I think the book would be rather different . Gradualism is a concept I believe in , not just because of Darwin 's authority , but because my understanding of genetics seems to demand it . Yet [ famous fossil expert stephen J . ] Gould and the American Museum people are hard to contradict when they say there are no transitinoal fossils . As a palaeontologist myself , I am much occupied with the philosophical problems of identifying ancestral forms in the fossil record . You say that I should at least `` show a photo of the fossil form which each type of organism was derived '' . I will lay it on teh line - there is not one such fossil for which one could make a watertight argument . '' Patterson came under fire from fellow evolutionists for having made this and similar candid admissinos , and attempted to soften the remarks retrospectively . However , the language is clear and unmistakable . Stephen Jay Gould , evolutionist said this : `` The lack of transitional fossils is the trade secret of palaeontology '' . All quotes came from `` The Revised Quote Book '' . You interestingly bring up human evolution . Human evolution is blank and filled with a tonne of holes that would sink the Titanic . Let us go through the basic evolutionary candidates : * Australopithecines ( Lucy fossil type ) : - Dr Charles Oxnard is one of a growing number of evolutionist anatomists who have examined vast numbers of measurements by computerized multivariate analysis ( an objective method that does not depend on preconceived beliefs about ancestry ) , do not believ that these creatuers are human ancestors . He states that although initally it was though that they were human-like or at least intermediate between apes and humans , the reality is that they `` differ more from both humans and African apes than do these two living groups from each other . THe australopithecines are unique . '' Recent CAT scans of the bony labyrinth which once housed their organ of balance have shown conclusively that they did not habitually walk upright , as many still insist . * Homo Habblis : - Many scientists ( evolutionary scientists included ) are now recognising that Habblis is a waste bin of two or more creatures , and hence , is an invalid category . Even so , the CAT scans have determined that Habblis was less bipedal than Australopithecines . So we are actually `` de-evolving '' if you will . * Homo Erectus and Neandertals : - Once again , CAT scans have shown that Erectus and Neandertals walked up right just like us . They would be able to run , hop , skip , jump , etc , and do all the things that we do today . Many scientists now classify erectus and neandertals as `` true humans '' . And it has been known that Neandertal types had been living at the same time as `` modern '' types . Tools found on an Indonesian island in associatino with stegodon ( an extinct elephant ) remains have cause evolutionist Dr Alan Thorne to suggest that these so-called `` pre-human ancestors '' had seafaring skills and technology . As far back as 1993 he said , `` They 're not [ i.e . should n't be called ] Homo erecus , they 're people '' . This quote came from the Australian , 19 August 1993 . If one uses the evolutionists ' own timescales and criteria for classification and plots all `` hominid '' fossil discoveries on a chart , it will readily be seen that the idea of any evolutionary sequence is a shambles . ( M. Lubenow , `` Bones of Contention '' ) . I found it interesting that you got your information from talkorigins.com . They totally do not know what they are talking about . In one article that I saw regarding SNRs they totally changed the scientific evidence to suit their own theory , as for one , the article was not written by an educated person , nor did it have any references - unlike the article on SNRs that was written by Answers in Genesis . Many of their arguments , like the one on your link can be easliy refuted . Other articles employ what is known as the `` straw man '' argument tactic , i.e . using an argument that can be easily refuted and one that is not held by anyone . If evolution is true , than we should expect to find millions and millions of fossils of in-between forms , right ? Well , the truth is , we do n't . Some evolutionists claim there are some - maybe a handful - of such in-between fossil types ( highly , highly , highly debatable ) . Other leading experts have rejected soe or all of these . What is not well known is that the interesting fossil creature Archaeopteryx , often used as an example of a transitional form between reptiles and birds shows none of the crucial transitinoal structures which would strongly argue for `` transitional '' status . The feathers are fully formed , and the wings are proper wings . It has the backward-facing claw and curved feet characteristic of perching birds . It wasmost definitely not , as some would reconstruct it , a running feathered dinosaur . In fact , the same can be shown to be true for whale evolution animals such as the Ambulocetus and the Basilosaurs . These are not evolutionary transitional forms , as you are often told . Many evolutionists do not even acknowledge them , but this does not mean that they do n't believe in their theory . So in this respect , the fossil record does not show evolution as you are commonly told . In fact , it tells us that things breed true to their kind , i.e . horses produce horses , cats produce cats and so on . You than go onto challange :
Apparently , all them dinosaurs were just too dumb to climb to higher ground or swim ( despite the fact that animals are among the first to do so in disasters - example would be the tsunami in Christmas 2004 ) All of this also avoids the flying reptiles such as the Pteranodons . Also , apparently humans are unique in that they are the only ones whose corpses bload and float to the water 's surface . What garbage will they come up with next ?
And I ask the question again . Have you read Dawkins ? Do you actually know what he says ? It 's a bit disengenuous to make such statements if you have n't read the books in question . How shall I say this ? You have been duped . Well - that 's going to be censored !
Are you saying that given enough time you can come with answers ? That 's a statement of faith .
Well , why do you support it ?
Hobbes specifically said that this is not the case . Cooperation exists , and is essential . Without it , the life of man would be `` a war of all against all '' , and would be `` solitary , nasty , brutish , and short . '' But man is inherently , biologically social , at the level of the family and the tribe . Daniel Boone , moving further into the wilderness whenever he could see the smoke from someone else 's cabin , or solitary hermits in the desert , are quite rare , and even they are dependent on the rest of society for sustenance . Solitary confinement is one of the worst punishments short of serious physical damage . Nor is a war of all against all true in evolution . Evolutionary theory includes the evolution of cooperation and altruism along with murder , hunting , and the like . For example , the cooperation of the cells in your body to form organs that support each other , and the mechanism of apoptosis by which most pre-cancerous cells and others that have suffered damage destroy themselves . Or the convergent evolution of numerous species of hive and nest insects ( and naked mole rats ) from solitary precursors . Or the cooperative evolution of eye and brain structures from light-sensitive cells , or bird 's wings along with hollow bones , or symbiosis of all kinds , including intracellular organelles such as mitochondria . Coevolution of bees and flowers is another instance . Or crocodiles not eating the birds that clean their teeth .

To each his own ... if you got it - flaunt it . Think of all the pretty , fashionable gun rigs that would spawn . Darn sinjin , you might have to get an outfit to get a date Course if you carried concealed like say , Mike Hammer , you might have to get a bowler or little CS hat ? Think of all the jobs it would create . Leather workers . Engravers . Gun finishes . More stylish guns . Corner gun stores and ammo at the local grocery , mail order business and on and on and on . `` Posers '' ? That is about all there is in kalifornia now is n't it ? It does n't bother you to watch scantily clad women ... or men , whatever your preference is ; why would full free exercise of a right freely stated in the Constitution be any different ?

Go get them Rev . It absolutely astounds me that there are Americans who feel that they can me people JUSTIFY things that other Americans want to do . This country is based on having to JUSTFY nothing to anyone . I do not have to explain my actions to anyone except in a court of law under criminal charges . I do not have to explain my NEED to a court of have a firearm or anyone else . Just like other things in the Constitution : 1 ) Do not have to justify need to by any kind of legal property or enter into any contract . 2 ) Do not have to justify need to publish a political statement . 3 ) Do not have to justify need to own a big house or a gold plated toilet . 4 ) Do not have to justify need to burn $ 20 bills in my fireplace . 5 ) Do not have to justify need to go or move in any public space . All this I can do without askingpermission from nobody . I do not need permission to buy and own , as many , or type of legal property , including guns .
Because there is no reason to do so .
Did I ever say that ?
Why would that even be expected ? When you consider that it is important to maintain some sort of consistency in study populations , obvious mutants are excluded from the breeding stock . And yet , there are frequent observed mutations . In fact , my elder son once observed two mutations in a single fly in one of his populations . One fly had no wings and white eyes .
My point here is that it could be argued very reasonably as to whether or not a fertilized egg , a zygote , an embryo , fetus , etc. , is a Someone .

What basis do fundamental rights derive from ? In other words , how can we tell whether something is a fundamental human right ?
A being is something that is conceivable as existing ... or something that actually exists . A human being is one of us , a homo-sapien , a member of the group of beings known as animals . A rock is a being of inanimate qualities . God is the supreme being , not capable of being understood totally as this would put Him ( or It , or She ) on the same level as those that He created . We will never be able to define exactly what or who God is ! God is great . God is good . Let us thank Him for our food . God is my shepherd . God is my Light . God is my Co-pilot . God is what keeps me from believing that all this ( the totality of all things and happenings ) came about by accident . When God made man , She was only kidding !

Could it be that the Supreme Court does not view the right protected by the Second Amendment as being fundamental ? This is the same court that said that only guns in common use are protected by the Second Amendment . That tells me the Supreme Court does n't think the right to bear arms is as fundamental as other rights protected by the Bill of Rights . The protection of a newspaper by freedom of the press does not depend on the newspaper being in common use .
How special , now all you have to do is prove that a glob of cells has rights
He 's pointing out that the situation is about the mother and the baby , and that the baby 's right to life ends exactly where the woman 's right to personal autonomy begins . That 's the interesting thing about rights-based ethics , that the rights of any individual are limited precisely by the rights of all other individuals .
Given that the fetus can feel no pain ( in the vast majority of abortions ) , whose pain should I be concerned about ? Even if it could , why would its pain be more worthy of protection than the mother 's ?
Is that not the whole impetus of the `` Intelligent Design '' movement ?
Nothing that prevents it communicating in theory , but I have covered the communication aspect already in this post . The idea that we are 'image bearers of the divine ' comes purely from human religions , and has no concrete basis . The atoms in my body were created by nuclear fusion in the centres of stars that exploded billions of years ago . Rather than being imago dei , we are stardust . I find that idea far more grandiose and appealing than divine providence . I 'm sure you 'll have more questions ! Anyone else got more than a trite one-liner on their idea of God ( or whatever you think he/she/it is ) ?
And you determined that I am an atheist exactly how ?
Well , `` reasonable '' is clearly subjective ... So the authors of the letter are practicly saying that any gun laws not interfering with the state militia would be permited according to the second amendment . But that gun laws obviously should be reasonable . But what reasonable is , is best left to the democratic will of the people . Or am I reading it wrong ?

Among the icons ( idols ) of modern mysticism there is one that reigns supreme . It is the myth of evolution . We scoff at the gods of the anchient pagans as if we were untouched by their superstition and yet we mystify our science with the likes of Darwin , the high priest of natural selection . Darwin taught a fable that started in a warm little pond and through a process that has became known as gradualism ( minute changes over eons ) all life arose out of a primordial soup . Life is not chaotic it is orderly and requires replication . Without this you just have a lot of chemicals mixing in an infinite variety . The reason that life must be derived from life ( biogenesis ) in the minds of most is that this is the only way we have ever seen it happen . `` You can imagine anything you like but you can only understand the truth '' as Newton said . Now if amino acids are the mirror image of nucleic acid sugars and this in true of all living things then we are limited to this as fundamental to life . This in my opinion is the fundamental first step and it can not happen peicemeal , it all has to happen all at once . One more thing , evolution is a biogenesis theory and actual evidence for abiogenesis is rare and fragmentary just as it is for every other aspect of the single common ancestor model .
Oh god I guess you know where this is headed ? This is the first I 've heard of this , sounds like know one died though ( hope this did n't hex it ) .
Please off one scientific piece of evidence in support of biblical creation .
I think you 're either lying or citing misinfomration . I can find only one quote from him with subvert in it .
I 'm now slightly less confused about why I 've never seen this discussed before .
Well you do n't need to doubt it . I like to be rational but I also wish to believe in God . I need some evidence , any evidence , to believe in God and that would be all I would need .
This is why people should n't have opinions , rather facts . Opinions should remain neutral untill sufficient objective evidence can be gathered . When people run off having `` opinions , '' they cause trouble . The fact that someone does n't do or believe what he is selling does n't affect the validity of the argument . There are teachers who do n't believe in evolution , yet they teach it because it 's standardized . You have people who promote an idea because it 's popular , because of convention , or because someone tells them to . Someone can be saying something , believing something else , yet be totally wrong . THeir belief is n't the fact .
You think it was Me ? You are yet again , confused . I do n't even know what a DROS is . Department of Registration Ohio State ? That would be my best guess , seeing that I am from Ohio !
First , are you not forcing your beliefs on me when you lobby for , enact , and support a law that legalizes an act that I see as murder ? Second , forcing someone to believe as I do is in no way the essence of Christianity . God gives choices ( which is another debate ) to man . We must simply choose right or wrong . Jesus wants us to influence , not force . Jesus said to His followers in Matthew 5:14-16 , `` You are the light of the world . A city on a hill can not be hidden . Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl . Instead they put it on its stand , and it gives light to everyone in the house . In the same way , let your light shine before men , that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven . '' If I truly believe in Jesus as my Lord and Saviour ( and I do ) , then I must follow His command to influence ( not force ) the whole world . It does n't do any good to only preach to the preached .
I believe that 's true , and as a `` believer '' ( creationist ) , here is what is hard to understand about that ; In Matthew , 12:30 , Jesus says `` He who is not with me is against me , and he who does not gather with me scatters '' . It is safe to say that both creationists and theistic evolutionists would accept that statement from Jesus , and would seek to be `` with '' him , while agnostic and atheists would consider themselves `` not with '' him . Yet theistic evolutionists are comfortable to ( usually politically ) be `` with '' agnostics and atheists , and separate themselves from creationists . If they 're genuine Christians , knowing about the warnings in the Bible about false teachings , how can they be comfortable with that ? Miller laments in several places throughout the book that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion , and that it should n't be that way - that it causes more strife between the two than should exist .
You know , your comparison of those that fought to end segregation , to those that fight to enact gun ban and gun control laws , is nothing more than a cheap and dirty tactic that does nothing to address the issue , and everything to suggest that breaking the law is alright if you 're a politician or legislator . There 's a very large difference between people like Rosa Parks , and the mayor of Philadelphia ; gun ownership is protected by the Constitution , segregation was n't . The fact that you 're comparing those who instituted civil disobedience for good reasons , to those who want to violate state laws to pass their own laws because they think they know better and have a right to do so , just shows that you ca n't address the point at hand .
The photoautotrophic ones do .
Just to be sure you understood , it was the picture below that picture you were supposed to look at .
I see .
So , in other words , what you 're saying is that the Pope , who just declared that all Christian Churches apart from the RCC to be false churches , including we evangelicals/fundamentalists is a fundie himself ? JPs right Matt , take your meds and do it quickly .
Oh , I know we have changed significantly . We now have the means to kill each other much more efficiently than we once did . In addition , we now have industrial capability , and the ability to destroy the entire planet a bit at a time . We can more efficiently drive lesser species to extinction . With every passing generation we become more cruel , and our ability to delude ourselves becomes ever more refined . now we kill hundreds or thousands a day with cruise missiles and bombs instead of swords and lances , or bows and clubs . Since we can now do it from thousands of miles away , we can simply pretend it is not happening and continue along in the delusion that we are `` civilized '' people . When we see low tech attacks close to home , actually smell the blood for ourselves , those who are particularly delusional ( like you ) bemoan the attackers as `` monsters '' . Like that bitch that kills off the weak pup in her liter , we kill of tens off thousands of weaker people in the quest for dominance . When was the last time you saw a german shorthair launch cruise missles to wipe out thousands of weaker pups for the advancement of some meaningless idealogical nonsense ? Next time you are sitting on your XXX in your favorite easy chair marveling at the `` accomplishments '' that have `` bettered '' the human race , while your bretheren are off killing people in order to further your idiotic ideological BS , you might keep in mind that the greatest difference between humans and animals seems to be that , while animals generally do their own killing , truly `` refined '' humans such as yourself ( and most other `` civilized '' people ) , get to set and home and send others out to do their dirty work . True , we have invented all kinds of mralistic , idealistic mumbojumbo to convince ourselves that we are more than just squabbling apes , but at the end of the day , that is all we are . Unfortunatly , we have managed to `` refine '' our instincts to the point that they are no longer sensible or natural . We still feel the instinct to kill , and we do so more effectivley than any other species on the planet . Unlike other species , which generally kill out of need , we have no need to kill , so we invent reasons in order to satisfy our blood lust .
So now anytime you do n't like something , you 're going to whine and bemoan it until there 's a law passed that makes it illegal , so it ca n't possibly ever happen again ? Where does a mentality like that stop ? Are you going to push for it to be illegal for a parent to let their child go out and play without first applying sunscreen so they do n't get burned ?
No . That 's not what I said . I said that natural selection is differential reproductive success . I said that those organisms that possessed advantageous characteristics would tend to reach reproductive age more frequently and therefore they will tend to produce more offspring , while those with disadvantageous characteristics will tend to produce fewer offspring . As a result , the heritable characteristics of the population will change over time .
I think an open mind is the best thing to have when it comes to theories . I think there is some truth in everything .
I have to agree with Jo Bennett here Fracas , you 're simply injecting your personal opinion about morality into a conversation on statistics . One has nothing to do with the other . Muddying the Waters is a tactic all too easily realized . Oh , and about your previous responce to my question . I would behouve you to pay attention to whom is doing the posting to understand their intent and bias .
yeah , i misread it . still ... .the point is the same .
I 'm glad to see you 've finally come around .
This is correct . It is almost insulting to regard people as either a ) Christian OR Catholic - as this also implies that Orthodox are neither
Of course , when wabbit says `` dishonesty , '' he means `` oversimplification '' ; the NMSR webpage is clearly designed for the layperson , not the geneticist . When he says `` scientist , '' he means `` shameless hack . '' Spetner argued that this is not an example of an increase in information until he had it repeatedly and undeniably shown to meet Spetner 's own definition of information . Only now has he said , `` Okay , so it 's an increase , therefore it 's not random . '' Classic moving the goalposts syndrome . But if wabbit would like to continue leaning on Spetner as a `` reliable source , '' I wo n't stop him . More fun for me .
The counter arguments put forth by its critics do not defeat the Violinist arguments , at the very least . Whether one accepts the argument anyway is another story : P
So where will you be moving to ?
Yes , theyre outside , theyre in academics , theyre writing books , theyre teaching very small children , theyre lining politicians pockets , theyre filing lawsuits challenging tradition and morals , theyre in a lot of places .
Yes you do . I 've already posted your words saying you believe it exists . Deal with that first . I note now you have a habit of just ploughing on ahead when faced with evidence . How do you know nothing about the unknowable ?
People are protected by law from being harassed , assaulted and/or murdered because they are people . Not because they are a certain religion . Because they are people it would be wrong to allow such things .
It is n't offered to make that assertion at all . It is offered to show that God values the life of the unborn if He will demand that a man responsible for causing its death in the womb be held accountable by paying the ultimate price .
Yes , because congresses powers are actually pretty limited . It hink it will be interesting to see how the 2 upcoming supreme court cases ( one has already been accepted , the other is pretty much a shoe in ) regarding the commerce clause will be handled , since the majority of the laws that congress passes are tied to it .
Pretty close to what we are doing . It is going to be outdoors , in my boss 's backyard ( nice area ) . It will be small , family , friends , 40 people tops . We will have some kind of food , have n't figured that yet . Got a really small budget . We plan on the vows , and rings and our parents doing something . Lucky for us , we have great friends who want to plan it for us . But some details I feel we should decide .
See above . And I did answer , therefore you are wrong .
Kellerman was n't fair when he did the comparisons for his study , do n't get upset when I use the same standard of review against you .
So you yourself could have gone gay but chose to be attracted to women ?
Actually , the idea that the death penalty costs more than lifetime imprisonment has been disproved many times . The lowest estimate of the yearly cost for imprisoning somebody is around $ 22,000 . The average amount of time a prisoner spends imprisoned after getting a life sentence is 60 years . Take into account the cost of building jails in order to house all these prisoners and you up the amount even more . After the average of 60 years for a life sentence , tax payers have spent $ 1,320,000 on ONE SINGLE PERSON . Imagine what this money could do in the education system ? You said yourself , the only thing that may push the cost of the death penalty over life imprisonment is the ridiculous amount of appeals that are given . If only one appeal was given before the sentence was final , it would be far cheaper to exectue somebody than imprison them for life . How many times does a person need to prove their innocence ? If they ca n't do it in the initial trial and after one appeal , sorry , game over ... you lose . You can read more at this site : http : //www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~tonya/spring/cap/pro5.htm
no , you just live on delusions . you ca n't argue the merits of creationism on their own because they do n't exist . Creationism is a fraud regardless of the existance of evolution .
Which woodpecker argument ?
its difficult to merge life in its purest form with science , even though science 's purpose is to study life . for instance , can life be defined as energy ? can life be compared with energy ? if so , then birth becomes as much of an enigma as death ; is energy created too ? ( not really addressing the debate , but more like raising more thoughts to debate on ... )
But you have n't looked . You may claim that your god did it , and no evidence to support or deny that can be offered . The assertion relies on miracle and has no suporting evidence . But when you start talking about how your god did it , your claims can be debunked by facts . Certainly the mythology of ancient nomadic herdsmen is not accurate . If you look at the world and the history of the world the is evident in the geologic strata , then you can see that the earth is very old , and you can see a succession of organisms through time . When considered with other fields of science from genetics to biogeography to physiology and anatomy , evolution becomes apparent .
Here is a more complete definition from Futuyma 's text on evolutionary biology .
ahhh , thats where youre mistaken . ANY aspect of science that can be discredited helps strengthen the creationist stance . the theory of electromagnetic radiation being wrong will be proof that God exists . the more we dont understand , the happier creationists are
In the case of Demorats and liberals ; it is monkey see , monkey do .
Well what do you expect ? ! Everytime gun owners try and do anything to combat crime , you liberal sissies yell and scream about vigilantism and foam at the mouth as you talk about how we 're taking the law into our own hands and that we 'll be administering death sentences without trials for matters as trivial as jaywalking ! You want us to combat crime , but you do n't want us to actually do anything . Make up your mind already !
Agreed . You might also ask whether you treat 1 cancer patient with this new expensiveand unreliable drug , or many patients with a different drug , or a different condition . The money has to stop somewhere .
Contraceptives ( for example a condom/ the pill ) are n't going to last a month effectively . Then there 's the fact that contraceptives , given the above data , can still be 99 % effective , as it does n't mention how many pregnancies they 've prevented . What does the writer make of this though ? `` According to this , condoms have a high failure rate for pregnancy . ''
Do I have tell you exactly how many rape/incest victims are the ones who decide an abortion is neccessary ? How many of them need to have counseling years afterwards because they had the abortion , not because they were a rape/incest victim ? There are very few if any girls in the U.S. that would have an abortion after an experience like that . It 's the family and relations that force them into it in order to keep the matter hush-hush . No doubt some of those reasons seem good , but abortion is an incorrect solution . The help a victim should get is a hug , some tears and comforting words so that they view their future life in a positive light . Instead , they bury them in words of `` GET AN ABORTION , YOU 'LL FEEL BETTER LATER '' . Yeah right . Oh , I think I 'll add that only 1 % of abortions performed yearly are for rape/incest cases . And some years it may even drop lower than that . Should we keep abortion legal for just that 1 % ?
I think a more telling question would be , why the hell would you rather feel constantly threatened than feel safe ? It seems completely idiotic to me . Smiley
Do you suggest that the USA send supplies or doctors to perform these abortions or that Tanzania does it ?
By removing you mean Killing the innocent of course , which is different to imprisonment of the criminal .
Well stated . Whatever the reason , the new culture of ridicule IS there . When you see the in person comments of Dawkins , Provine , Myers , you 'll know where posters here get it from . I hope you 'll watch the movie , and post up what you think .
Because you asked me to quote your lies . I did . Not only can you not find whichever source you claim speaks of birds ' infrared vision , you apparently ca n't find any source that does so . Despite this , you 've been whining about how visible and UV camouflage must be moot because of birds IR vision . And to top it off , rather than admit to your mistaken memory , you 're blaming the imaginary source :
Without the Fall , Jesus would have no need to come to earth and be resurrected . Without Genesis , the entire bible-as-literal kinda falls apart .
No , not really ...
Fascinating - you blew right through your own usual misunderstandings of Darwinism and Darwinists and ended up with a sentence that is actually meaningful . HGT ( along with genetic drift ) are important parts of modern evolutionary theory , but they do indeed have nothing to do with darwinian evolution sensu stricto , which does indeed insist on natural selection . This is why evolutionary biologists object to being called Darwinists in the sense that you and WW usually try to impose on us , and it is why we insist that there is more to evolution than natural selection or RM & amp ; NS alone , and it is why we talk about the Neodarwinian Synthesis and Modern Evolutionary Theory . HGT validates the modern ToE . Modern evolutionary theory incorporates Darwin 's version , and lot 's more . HGT is part of the `` lots more '' . Some versions of lateral gene transfer have been accepted and studied for many decades , notably versions of conjugation in bacteria . ( It was n't until biologists were able to start sequencing DNA in quantity that we were able to see all the retroviral DNA segments and so forth . ) When someone like Gould ( for example ) talks about Darwinian evolution , depending on context , they are talking about either 1 ) the historical early version of the ToE as Darwin envisaged it , 2 ) the position that natural selection is the dominant process in evolution , or 3 ) an instance of evolutionary change in which natural selection is inferred to have been by far the most significant process . Evolution has moved well beyond Darwin 's initial ideas to include mutations , recombination , and genetic drift , including HGT , in all sorts of combinations with each other and with natural selection . As Chemist says , once HGT has occurred , the new version with the new genes can easily find itself competing with the old version , providing another way that NS can be involved , but it does n't have to be . NS is just not all there is to evolution . I ca n't wait to see how you are going to misinterpret this next .
Yep . Here in the U.S. , the 5.7 ammo is the ordinary hollow point for Civilian use . It does not penetrate . It is not Armor Piercing .
Excuse me , but you did n't fully read what he wrote . He did n't say that he supported abortion . He said that he was n't as much a freak about it as you 're being .
Sadly , you may be correct . The mindless majority of the American people have been duped to believe that science is somehow opposed to their religion . They know that the mythology of bronze age nomads is historically correct . Do n't confuse them with facts - so what if grasshoppers do n't have 4 legs , what if rabbits do n't chew cud , and who cares it bats are not birds ? The Bible is true without error . Certainly people who have bee indoctrinated to believe that `` GODDIDIT '' will believe that question . They have been taught that it is a sin to question revealed truth , and revealed truth is revealed by `` ministers '' who are scientifically illiterate . Why does creationism seem to be a matter of the views of those who are becoming rich from the stupidity of the Christins masses . In the mean time , the U.S. is now a second rate country , where our universities are manned by an increasing number of foreign professors . I do n't have a problem with foreign professors except that there are no qualified U.S. citizens out there . It is becoming increasingly apparent that the leadership of U.S. universities is due to the influx of foreign professors . They get paid more here than in their own country , and of course , they are more qualified than U.S. applicants for their positions . I wonder if our universities will be able to maintain leadership in the world of academia when the entire upper echelon is overtaken by better educated and more qualified foreigners . In fact : Japan has about half the population of the U.S. and graduates about twice the number of students with degrees in science and engineering . Is n't it wonderful that we are debating the pseudoscience of creationism and ID in our school boards ? It is the beginning of the end .
Cases v United States , 131 F. 2d 916 ( 1st Cir . 1942 ) , cert . Denied sub nom. , Velazquez v. U.S , 319 U.S. 770 ( 1943 ) . Basically , The US Curcuit Court upheld that the Second Amendment did n't apply to weapons that could n't be carried by an individual .
Only if she 's piloting at the same time .
So what if a bunch of rich lobbiest got together and found a way to overturn that ? Do you think they should be allowed to do that ? What if they said that because of organ donor shortages that now it would be law in your state that when you die , all of your organs would be taken out and reused without your permission . Would that be OK for them to do ?
why the comparison of gun owners yo violent killers and serial rapists ? What law have I broken ? Since we are doing comparisons your anti-freedom agenda is very similar to the bazi gun control laws of the 1930s , it is like the jim crow laws of the US . Your agenda is one of racism . This is insulting , ignorant , and shows your true colors as an enemy of freedom .
First , take a visit to Mount Olympus . Secondly , Greek myths were written for entertainment . Lastly , if Zeus or any other mythological gods existed , why would n't they/it preserve their worshippers ? When a human ( actually , in the case of the Jews , humanS ) make efforts to completely eliminate a race or religious group of people and there Book ( the Bible ) for over thousands upon thousands of years , and the people and Book are still preserved , that is evidence of a God , in my opinion .
So , in summary , you are n't against the death penalty on principle . You just want it used judiciously ? Same here . Where we 'll differ is in the details of what 's judiciously .
Forgive me for laughing ; no , not really ha , ha , ha ha ha Could it be that people here as well as Canada and the rest of the world has figured out your infantile `` grading system of States '' is a complete sham and your very reason for existing is but an anti-constitutional farce and has lost any claims you have or will make ? You stand alone now brady , with simply a few still clinging to the false hope of having others pay for your failures and unConstitutional stance so you can sit on your hands while you keep harping on overturning the 2A .
But your proof did n't claim that God could do anything possible . Maybe only one person could build a computer , maybe one person could make a car , maybe one person could run the mile in under 4 minutes . That does n't mean that God can do ALL of these things . It means that whoever we define to be the greatest being , we can call him god and thus he exists . Of course this would n't be sufficient to Christians as this says that God is probably mortal and has the limits of being a physical being .
Why do n't you just sum it up with `` If you 're not a fundamentalist Christian '' ? You also fail to consider Christian agnostics .
Actually , yes .
If you think something is correct then you believe this . That 's all believe means . I believe the above statement is very true . Except that you would n't have to completely change your ideas or beliefs about the universe all the time . But you 'd have to modify them . Anyway , who said beliefs had to be static and fixed ?
I believe in what I have no evidence to support . That is faith . I do not believe in evolution . The evidence is overwhelming for the educated . As for your `` stumbling blocks , '' they are founded in ignorance . Why do n't you educate yourself ? You make creationism look foolish . By the way , what is the problem with Archaeopteryx ? I 'm sure that you have educated yourself to address the list of features that I gave . I just ca n't believe that you would speak to the issue and not understand the implications of all of those points that I listed . Were you just a parrot ? It seems that you lack the ganas to even say that you do n't know . An example of `` creation science '' at its best !
So why are you here ? Do you have anything to offer of any substance ?
The big bang , life from non-life , the progression of life from the simple to the complex , just to name a few . None of these can be proved ( even on the balance of probabilities ) to be true by operations science . All of these contradict scientific observations of the present . As a result , you must take them by purely blind faith .
That clearly went whooshing over your head . It was intended to mock the OP . ( Interesting `` new '' bibilical revelation , indeed . ) I do n't put any credence in silly comparisons like the trite Kennedy/Lincoln litany that arose in the 60 's or the similarly absurd list that INRI posted . They both demonstrate how one can concoct meaningless comparisons in an attempt to invent a non-existent connection between two unrelated events . It is the same for all `` prophesies '' .
just how i said it ... opinion ... like , what you think of it
But you know that this is not what I was saying : We have a basis for comparison .
So please , feel free to leave this thread to those who DO wish to discuss the issue . No one is forcing you to discuss the topic of this or any other thread . I notice you evidently are not interested in `` Understanding `` Sexual Prejudice '' '' That is absolutely fine with me . Or are you now opposed to `` Freedom of Speech '' also ?
So the entire Catholic Church is nothing more then a social club ?
Well , many argue that pro gay rights is a conservative . They say that conservatives favor government staying out of people 's lives and not dictating the way that people should live . They argue that conservative people are using religion , not conservative principle to stand against gay rights . I do n't know if that is true ; I do know that whether conservative , liberal , both , or neither , I can not find a way to call myself a good person if I do not support gay rights .
so thats quite contradictory to me ... you would allow a law that killls millions of innocent babies a year and get rid of a law that rightly carries out the law ... wierd sounds like a liberal to me .
Yes it is . It will be funded by government money , the taxpayer will foot the bill . The argument that it will not be `` subsidised '' is based on the ridiculous hypothesis that somehow , someway , it will turn a profit and pay back the enormous injection of public funds needed to start it up ( of course , providing an interest-fee-unlimited-repayment-term-loan is in itself , also a subsidy ) . If it behaves in such a way as to maximise profit , like its private sector alternatives , what possible purpose does it serve ? It 's either a ) Pointless . Why do n't we also have a `` public option '' pizza restaurant chain and a `` public option '' door to door sales force ? or b ) Very bad . With about a 99.999 % probabilty of b )
Only a microscopic number of mass shootings involved the killer holding a concealed carry permit . Plus you ca n't prove the lack of a concealed carry permit would actually stop any killings .
Then a man who needs an artificial heart to survive is a new species of man . That is the analogy I gave , and you ignored . In both cases ; human and bacteria , before the advent of a human product , a particular group of individuals from each larger group would die off . BUT along come a man-made invention that allows those certain portions to live on which otherwise would have died . In once case - nylon , the other , the artificial heart . You call this evolution . Nor is it 'natural selection ' at work either , as in both cases the thing that enabled them to survive was not natural . What you have advanced as a proof of evolution actually proves what ? Natural what ? I suppose people with cochlear implants are new species too because they 've learnt to hear . Another view of this nylon-eating-bug is given ... `` Finally , Mr Cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift . New evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [ e.g . K. Kato , et al. , ? A plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation : Nucleotide sequence analysis of pOAD2 ? , Microbiology ( Reading ) 141 ( 10 ) :2585 ? 2590 , 1995 . ] In fact , more than one species of bacteria have the ability , residing on plasmids . This suggests that the information probably already existed , and was just passed between different types of bacteria . '' `` All that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic ( protein-degrading ) enzyme . This may seem surprising ? How would a loss of information create a new ability ? Answer : enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule ( the substrate ) . Loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function , but would enable it to degrade other substrates , too . Since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages , a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon . If this process were continued , the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required . To put it into perspective , acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions , but they also lack specificity . Indeed , an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme '' http : //www.answersingenesis.org/home ... e7-24-2000.asp Talkorigins gave their usual doubletalk `` Whilst this particular case does not `` prove '' evolution , it is consistent with , and supportive of , the theory of biological evolution . '' Why do they say this ? Because it 's still a bacteria . It 's not like it suddenly became a large multi-cellular organism . But it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations . One site does say that it , the bacteria , had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ? mutations ? , but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus . http : //members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htm One poster on another forum summed the problem up like this ... `` In order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain , which is n't the case with nylon eating bacteria . The bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon , therefore was able to survive in a new environment . Two distinct advantages But , the bacteria lost its ability to survive in its old environment , eat its former diet and suffered a 98 % loss in efficiency . Three disadvantages . So by taking two steps forward and three steps backward , where is the net gain ? If nylon eating bacteria was `` proof '' of evolution , we would still be pond scum , but with the ability to digest whatever happened to become the primary food source .

Too be sure . However , there seems to be a lot of CLERGY that are not 'true christiasns ' . Or , could it be , that the person making that claim is not a 'true chrisitan ' , but is in denial ?
Well , I suppose that the reply it took me almost 5 minutes to type , a couple more to check and a couple to correct will not suffice now .
Just another example of using a verse meant for personal use and applying it to wars . Sorry , just does n't work that way .
yes and my post was proving that
Well , that is a load of lots of misinformation , and some misconceptions . The reason that we do have not observed any life coming from non-life is for several reasons . 1 ) the environment is changed . We no longer have a methane atmosphere that is full of organic matrials . 2 ) even if some did come , how would we know ? If we came accross it , we would assume it was there for a long time . You are incorrect about dating fossils . One way that fossils are dated is vis radiometric dating . I know answer in geneis has a lot of misinformation ( and plain out lies ) about radiometiric dating . Here is a link to a web site that explains it , and also answers the critiism of creationists http : //www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dating.html We have seen 'answers in genesis ' many many times . They make a lot of invalid asserstoins , and basically are ignorant when ti comes to science . Their main arguenent consist of misrreprenting the viewpoint of science , the logical fallaciy of personal incredibilty , and the logical fallacy of the arguement from ignorance .
No Ted Kennedy is not a fundie but Vitter is . For God sake the pope is a nazi and a fundie . Marlene Elwell , the nazi *itch , who put the evil mariage amendment on the michigan ballot is a Roman Catholic also . If you are a christian and you believe in the suppression of homosexuality then you are a fundie and a christianist .
Yes , and a plausible , possible explaination of how one evolved into another was presented , you 're the only one talking about a creature not breathing for millions of years . This goes back to your complete lack of knowledge of evolution ... ... .. Where did you demonstrate that the avian lung could not evolve from the dinosaurian lung ?
why are you afraid of guns ? has one jumped up and shot at you ? you should never fear a gun , respect the gun .
Well do you mean Texas or Texans ? Because Texas holds the record for execusions in the US . Not something I 'd be proud of .
I see no reason why secular shows should be required to mention your mythology .
Yes I do . Anytime there 's a mass killing , you and your ilk are holding it up as an example of how we need more gun control , how we have to reduce the rights of the people so those that die wo n't have died in vain .
This was a comment on the physics book that has biographies of great physicists that were Bible believing christians . Right . Many believed in alchemy ( they were wrong ) , harmful effects of night air ( they were wrong ) , spontaneous growth of maggots from rotting meat ( they were wrong ) , rats arising from grain ( they were wrong ) , and the Bible ( they were wrong ) . If it is important that Newton believed in the Bible , why is n't it as important that he believed in alchemy and did not believe in the divinity of Christ . There is n't any such thing as science from a Christian perspective . Either it is science , or it is n't . You claimed to have studied evolution . You did n't . Why would you tell us that you did ?
Not all evolution takes place over billions of years . There has been speciation that we have actually seen occuring within a few years at a time . `` bacteria , birds etcs . '' Natural selection occures frequently . You can `` observe '' evolution through the fossile record , DNA , morphology etcs . Evolution has made predictions , these predictions have come true , ergo , it 's good .
That 's true , but how much have we actually learned , and how much have we theorized , with an atheist presupposition , the only presupposition currently allowed ?
It was a pretty clear rebuttle of the idea that the ToE breeds social elitism , Marxism , and Nazisim . I guess you 're right though , SS . This was n't nearly as entertaining as a slough of out-of-context quotes to show that ToE-accepting biologists reject the ToE .
Obviously not about abortion .
But can you answer simone or jito 's argument 's successfully and counter their posts ? If you ca n't , then in essance , they won .
would that be legaly owned guns , or criminals who have guns ( and also ues guns ) for there crimes ? most Gang members have guns , if they are killed in a drive by shooting , is the gun responsable , or would it be the illegal activitys ?
And yet the Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center can come up with only a handful of incidents where a concealed carry holder assaulted another . Not even 300 incidents , as opposed to countless hundreds of thousands of concealed carry holders who have never done anything wrong . The math speaks for itself , you lose this one as well .
You not differentiating between the beaver and the beaver dam , the bird and the bird 's nest or the man and the man 's truck . The dams , nests and truck do not occur naturally ... they are constructed by the naturally occuring animals using materials that occur in nature ( albeit we have to smelt the iron and vulcanize the rubber whilst the birds and beavers just stick stuff together ) .

Still good reading and interesting real interesting if you like reading ... sounds plausible .
Most of the laws of the Peoples Republic of Kalifornia are aimed at rendering the citizens into prey . You ca n't point to many that do n't . Self defense is not allowed there I am afraid .
What other theories ? Why mention them if you are n't going to explain them ? You are actually on a board of education ? I notice there was no mention of telling kids that there are other theories of gravity and that all of them have holes . Evolution is a more secure theory than gravity .
Yep - that 's someting that many `` pro-lifers '' also never take into account .
Abstinence until you are old enough to handle sexual relationships responsibly should most certainly be preached along with information about and access to birth control . There are plenty of us who have no interest in the institution of marriage - your religion should not determine who amongst is a sexually active adult . Not to mention we have got to stop pushing the got ta get married have a partner to be a happy seccuesful person message - ESPECIALLY TO GIRLS - it will lead to sex , for heaven forbid they be SINGLE .
a ) Ad homimem fallacy b ) Strawman`s fallacy Could you debate honestly ?
The argument that the baby is not a parasite , but is rather 'in its natural environment ' seems a false dichotomy : it is natural for a parasite to be in the enviroment of another 's body , invading it . The relationship element will be dealt with in the third section .
That 's NOT the equivalent of ID - you 're mixing causes & amp ; effects . The theory of evolution , and the theory of intelligent design would equally observe , measure , and publish the effects of the apple falling . Then the evolutionists would say that happenstance origins caused gravity to work that way , and ID proponents would say that a supernatural design caused gravity to work that way . Students should n't have it implied to them that happenstance origins are the only possible cause of gravitational behavior . Your `` apple falling '' scenario is a simple one - the original cause of gravity has practically no impact on how we observe and deal with it 's effects . Other scientific subjects are n't that simple .
Really ? Funny , my son , even before I `` came out '' did n't think gays were bad or being gay was bad . He saw hate as being the real evil ... and you exemplify that just perfectly ... brava !
Oh sinj.do n't let it get you down , it do n't mean nothing ( sorry could n't help it )
So would genetic enhancement 100 years ago ! Peace ,
Actually you could look at this issue in several different ways.Lets start with welfare.Lets say the mother of a newborn who is responsible to finacially and physically take care of her child gets on state aid and agrees to not take child support from the father if he chooses to *opt out*Okay thats fine and dandy but if you think the goverment is going to support HIS child bucause he chooses not to , well HAHAHA YOU HAD BETTER THINK AGAIN ! Anyways things will NOT be equal until a man can actually carry and give birth to a child.Comparring the right to choose abortion and the right to choose not to pay support are completely two different issue that are not comparable.A women has to risk her possible life long health to either choose pregnancy/birth OR abortion a man does NOT risk either in his choice to support or not.This issue does n't even touch on abortion for rape/incest or health reasons of the mother and or fetus . seems to me a deadbeat dad is using the pro-choice position to get out of paying support when HIS body is n't even in the issue .
Well , here is the article from the BBC yesterday . That article puts it here . Eusthenopteron - > Panderichthyes - > Tiktaalik - > Acanthostega - > Ichthyostega There are other examples of transitionals in the gap where they have placed Tiktaalik . From the age ( 383 million years ) , it would have fit in to the sequence like this . Panderichthyes - > Tiktaalik - > Elginerpeton - > Ventastega - > Metaxygnathus - > Acanthostega - > Ichthyostega Of course I do not mean to imply that any of these is ancestral to any other . Venastega , for example , is more primative in form that Acanthostega , and something like Venastega would be expected in the transitional sequence . However , it was almost contemproaneous with Acanthostega . And I 'm not sure where to put Pederpes finneyae . It is apparently not as old as Tiktaalik . It would also date to the same period between Panderichthys and Acanthostega known as Romer 's Gap . Per Ahlberg posted a `` hint '' about Tiktaalik on the IIDB evolution board on March 30 . Two articles and a News & amp ; Views piece by Per and Jenny Clack were published in Nature today . NEWS There are pictures in Nature
Well , both are b -- -- y nuisances and one is a bit shorter and hairier than the other .
The simple fact is that people do n't want the immense responsibility that logically pertains to their voluntary actions actions , so they fabricate denials of reality as a convenient escape , out of pure selfishness -- like every other atrocity in history . The study of law includes an analysis of how people excuse their wrongdoings , fabricating pausible rationalizations for their acting to benefit at another 's expense ; denial is typically the first of these , claiming that the act `` does not hurt anyone , '' however obvious the contrary . Other rationales follow , such as self-preservation , natural right to act , and eventually growing defensive by blaming the victim . While the fabricator typically believes his story original , it is anything but -- it 's simply the inevitable course of selfishness .
Well , that statement would be half right
I cant think of another subject on this planet that has the interchangeability that evolution does . Dawkins ;
Yes they did : `` ... it ate itself . '' No wonder they 're extinct ...
Oh ohhh ! Appeal to authority ! Appeal to authority ! There 're no authorities in science . ONly logic and evidence . If he thinks omniscience and omnipotence are logically possible , he 's most likely lying , misinformed , miseducated in metaphyscis , or loony . Omniscience and Omnipotence are logically impossible . His famous nature does n't excuse him , just as much as it would n't if Einstein were to say the same thing . People are fallible . Note* : I am not saying his BIOLOGY is wrong . His understanding of logic as it applies to theology is . I am quite confident he knows a lot about evolution and biology . That 's his job .
Bah humbug . Their hormones are all the encouragement they need .
My my , did someone get up on the wrong side of the bed or what , of course you realize that you just gave me the answer I was looking for , not that I didnt already know the answer , I just wanted you to say it . I dont believe I need a clue , so I will let you have it instead Brady .
And lets not neglect the fact that he was tetotal and a vegetarian to boot . Well , looky here we all learnt today that bad people can have have good characteristics ... ... ... ... Sounds like Pastor Russell Johnson 's representation of truth is as selective as it is self serving .
Ingus , please see my comments at the end of my previous post . The purpose of this thread is to introduce ourselves and have a Q & amp ; A about the basis for each others views etc . If you want to debate the specific differences we may have in our views , either open a new thread and invite me over , challenge me , whatever ... But I 'm not going to debate it here . I think this thread is a great idea . People should introduce themselves , lay out their views however they see fit and let others do the same .
But we have an enumerated Constitutional RKBA . Apples to oranges .
But we certainly have the right to evict such persons . But then , regardless , the embryo is not a person .
And the Violence Policy Center is somehow more trustworthy ?
Reasonable people would look for justification for their beliefs . Many who have beliefs based on faith , however , accept things because they feel like accepting them . Including , absolute truths , and contradictions . The resultant SHOULD be peaceful acceptance because after all , they can both be correct , yet be in contradiction , according to faith-based belief systems . The reality would probably be , as you say , that they would mix up faith and reason and start claiming one is `` actually correct '' , and the other is `` The work of the devil '' , and proceed to clobber the other religion , absorb their members , abordb the traditions that were `` popular '' from the other religion , rename them and re-color them to match their religion , and carry on proclaiming truth and the afterlife and mercy and whatever else pops into their heads . That 's of course , based on what I 've seen and read . -Mach
No I 'm not afraid ... I just do n't respond unless there 's something worth responding to . I do n't respond to nonsense . If someone wants to talk science then I 'll be happy to play along .
So what 's your solution , keep all blacks unarmed so the bad blacks ca n't hurt the good blacks ? I guess you 've decided to drop your argument that the Second Amendment was a racist tool designed to keep blacks `` in their place '' under the thumb of their masters .
Thank You ! I think we will !
The claim is based on the woman telling people that the child was Bush 's , and her dating him at the time : P
Well , creationists claim he said that . However , there is no real evidence he ever did . They give two sources.. one says it is was in the 100th edition of the 'origin of species ) , and the other one was on the centinial edition ( which is a real trick , since that is 4 years after his death ) . No one seems to be able to find the primary source for that quote . Imagine that .
How do you know if they WANT to believe in a deity ? They simply do n't .
Which demonstrates your failure to see the big picture .
That does n't teach ( here is the topic braille ) student athletes anything , it is discrimination and violation of their 2A rights . Drugs are just a strawman . Strike three !
Like , I said , I ca n't take men 's position on abortion seriously b/c they can spout off all they want ; however their viewpoint must be affected somewhat by the fact that they will never actually have to make the decision themselves . As far as circumcision ... um ... who cares ? J/k . I really do n't know what to think about that . Never given it alot of thought , as I 've never had a penis , do n't plan on growing one , and therefore I ca n't have a valid point of view . Do whatever feels best to you . Get my drift ? Hey , you two , Clerisian and Steeeve , quit arguing semantics . Geesh !
We 've said that it is living , but that it was n't a life .
And what does stop you ? You could decide that for yourself . But that would n't make the action just or moral . That action would still hurt people , and it would still be evil . So perhaps I should ask , if God were not threatening religious people with Hell , would they still be good people ? Or are all of the selfless and generous actions of religious people stemmed from the selfish desire to get into heaven ? If they are not stemmed from their own selfish desire to enter heaven , then they are they not rooted in that individual 's own desire to help others . This exists in some people . For those in whom it does not exist , we have the law . We create governments to do that which is in our best interest and that which is in our best interest is that which helps everyone . For that which harms someone else might soon be that which harms us . I have oversimplified what is a very complex understanding of morality , but the point is that the morality of an atheist does not begin with the desire to enter heaven , it begins with the desire to help others or create a society which will help everyone .
I dont think I have heard a more pathtic excuse for a long time . All but a few of my colleagues could get into work during the very worst of the weather..why ? because they didnt get paid otherwise . There needs only be a tiny amount of snow for UK teachers to stay away in droves ... what a joke ! Strangely enough when I went to school both the pupils and the teachers seem to manage to get to school in the snow .
Poor guys they are so screwed . We get it all the time here in Australia , dont fight back just call the cops , who may be there in 35 minutes as the average response time ! ! Now the cops are not going to stop criminals from running away . This is very very disturbing news for every citizen of not just South Carolina but America .
So now you want to demonstrate that you are also ignorant of the fossil record ?
Who but a creationist would ever make such a laughable claim ?
No , instead you perfectly demonstrated your lack of comprehension .
I think this post pretty much sums up the depths of your prejudice , and the thoroughness of your ignorance . A child should endure physical abuse before being allowed to be adopted by a loving gay couple ? Being abused physically is preferential to being adopted by a loving gay couple ? I always have to chuckle when people are so eager to reveal their prejudices in such a way that demonstrates they are completely non-credible as any type of character witness ...
Upon what basis would discussion be acceptable if not scripture ? If we are to debat the topic , what sources for informational purposes do you consider as `` authoritative '' ? EF
Interesting thought ... .. such a situation would theorectically remove the division of opinion that exists based upon the perspective of gender ( ie . the pro-life religious male ) and would make any difference of opinion be based on moral/philosophical considerations alone . You could argue it would shift opinion towards the mix currently held by women as everyone would be in the position of having to bear pregnancy . Given that there is a full mix of religious and other beliefs in the current day female population perhaps this would be a good analogy to such a state of being you suggest .
Nope not kidding . Matter has a CONTINUUM of complexity . At some point in that CONTINUUM we assign ( in a rather imprecise way ) the property of Life to the matter concerned . Other less complex matter is assigned the abstract property dead or non-living . If you were more familar with the true range of complexity which matter exhibits you would be aware that the division is rather arbitrary . For example people have much difficulty on agreeing on whether viruses are living or non-living matter . And its clear that while you can not analyze complexity in matter that it does exist . Its there and its real and its a lot more real than simple taxonomic categories like lfe and non-life are .
The Skeptic has requested no judges . This actually suits me as there are too many of you that I 'd have to pick from and I therefore avoid slighting anyone by not picking them
Where has it been shown ? How is it used to make predictions about species chances of survival for the future ?
Its better then being dead ... ... ... ... .
So you actually know enough , you can see the beginning and end of time , you know what is inside each and every individual on the planet so much so that you can say God is wrong to do any given act ? How is this possible oh great and mighty oz ?
Is this not illegal ? Both federal and state laws prohibit businesses from denying public accommodation to citizens on the basis of race , color , religion or national original . The Federal Civil Rights Act guarantees all people the right to `` full and equal enjoyment of the goods , services , facilities , privileges , advantages , and accommodations of any place of public accommodation , without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race , color , religion , or national origin . '' If the reason a pharmacy kook is refusing service based on their belief that doing so is contrary to their religious beliefs ( or that they are supporting a behavior that is considered bad in their religion ) , then is it not clearly illegal ? The grey area is of course if they lie and say it 's not religion , it 's just `` ethics '' , or `` whim '' . In that case it may not be illegal , but if I got that in writing , that my employee was refusing to take customers based on their own person ethics or on a whim , it makes it easy to fire them since it 's already established that they are being fired for reasons other than illegal reasons ( race/religion/color , etc . ) Up to the courts I suppose . Personally I would feel discriminated against , and `` morality '' is easily linked to religion ( especially in these cases ) . If I were discriminated against on religious grounds I 'd feel I have a pretty good case ( not necessarily a good chance of winning in this christian/ignorant nation ) . -Mach
Is this what you guys are after ?
Thank you for your reply kelvin90701 . I will give my thoughts on all of your points soon , for now , I am just leaving , so I will just inquire as to what you mean on part of your post . Specifically , the following : The WMD analogy is poor . You will not find any vendors . Please find another one . There may be Constitutionally poor arguments in favor of banning WMDs for civilians , that argument is moot . You will not find any vendor . The Constitution protects my right to own arms . That does not mean arms vendors must be forced to sell thier product to me if I want one . That argument is moot . So , what you are saying , is there is no constitutional protection given to the manufacturer of weapons . That is , it would be constitutional to ban the manufacture of guns ? If so , would it still be OK , for an American citizen to buy any weapon that they would want from a foreign government/manufacturere , etc ? Again , thank you for your response . -Dan
Andrea Yates - Profile of Andrea Yates Cybererratus , is Gary Ridgway something of a hero to you ?
Yep it is easy . Lizards did n't evolve an avian lung . This should be easy for the creationist : The avian lung is far more efficient than the mammalian lung . Why did n't your god therefore fit the superior lung design to mammals , especially that apparent `` special creation '' , us humans ? Also please explain why he fitted a superior eye design to squid and octupuses than what he fitted to all vertibrates . Once you have answered these two easy questions , I 've a few hundred more for you
After . Christian fundamentalism is somewhat recent . It arose as a backlash to discoveries being made in science in the 19th century . From one follower of a 7th Day Adventist prophetess came `` flood geology '' in the early 20th century . Later , in the renewal of interest in the adequate teaching of science in the U.S. in the 1960s , there arose more modern `` creation science . '' It began by adopting the flood geology of the 7th Day Adventists as the base . Creation science begins with the assertion the the creation stories , the flood story , even the mythology of Job and Jonah , are literally true . Creation scientists then attempt to distort the evidence to support this particular version of the Bible . When creationists realized that the biological evolution of species does occur , they decided that God had created original `` kinds '' and then allow hyper evolution after that . Creationists call hyperevolution variation in kind .
Good questions : points for question one . God might have made the universe , but he left reproduction to follow the aggressive laws of nature . Overpopulation concerns me . An overpopulated country , is very likely a hungry , diseased and war torn one . I believe that abortion should be kept legal up until the point agreed by most physicians that the child 's life is viable outside the womb . I believe that abortion is as much playing God as is in-vitro fertilization . Women who force nature to give them a baby probably make me as angry as taking away a baby makes you . I believe in adoption of the worlds children before reproduction . question two : I believe that many people that are against abortion are working on ending hunger . I also believe that those who are working to end hunger , most likey have their hands so full with the task that their time , energy and focus cant be spent on ending abortion . Thats my view .
Just like we waited until after society decided how it would view civil rights for blacks ? No one is forcing you to debate the constitutional issues . If you do n't wish to , fine ; do n't . I seriously doubt if anyone would miss your input .
Maybe you could mention some of these plenty people .
And not that much longer for segregation in many states . No . But the resultant unwanted children would be an equally distressing social and financial cost . My point was the fruitlessness of antiquated belief system morality driving moral legislation that defies a woman 's civil liberty and common sense .
ya i am trying to work on that stuff . ummm my debate is to get ppl to read it and argue what i have so i can help them
Oh , I get it Flashlights and I-Pods have souls and consciousness .
I think the Obama administration has been working with Republicans , and much too much . That 's why the bill is what it is . Although I think it was Feingold who said that Obama has gotten the bill he intended to , from the beginning .
You have a lot of choices . My wife had an abortion before we met . My mother also had an abortion when I was about 8 . They both have regretted it greatly . Have you considered adoption ? There are many many many great couples who can not have babies that would love to have one and some companies can set you up with those that are willing to pay for the doctors fees and hospital fees etc . This is indeed traumatic and a difficult choice . It is one I do not wish on anyone . I hope you know some folks you can trust to guide you and to lean on regardless of your decision . You can still keep it , even though it will be hard , giving life is a wonderful thing . I would suggest that you consider all angles . Talk with those that lead you both ways . Be wary of anyone who just confirms whatever you say . They are not likely giving you sound wisdom but just want you to like them . Pay attention to those that are secure enough in your relationship with them to speak openly and honestly to you . They may confirm your thoughts they may deny them . Good luck . EF
So it 's alright for a Evo to insult you and go off on a tangent , and expect to get answer . What 's the point in answering if your being mocked , before you give answer . Now I know why there are few Creo 's on this forum .
Yes , have you ?
I still have n't heard an answer to this yet ?
Really ? The Republicans have just discovered that 80 % of hip replacements are done through Medicare and that the waiting time is much shorter than in Canada .
Well some call me liberal ( VoR anyone ? ) and I am definately pro-choice , I 'll chime in here . I completely agree that in Roe v. Wade they made the wrong decision . I think ammendment X comes into play here . Nowhere in the Constitution does it allow for the federal government to make restrictions based on abortion . This should be up to the states . Now on that same note it is also unconstitutional for the federal government to make a law banning abortion . This is a law that should be addressed by the states as it is not resered to the federal government .
So what are some examples of restrictive gun laws in South Africa ? The people in South Africa think their gun laws are not strict enough . In one of your previous posts you seem determined to use South Africa as evidence that outlawing guns does n't work . But gun ownership is still legal there .
Well to get healthcare from $ 6000 per person to $ 3,400 per person you 'd have to pay them less or fire them . So do I understand you correctly that we will either cut pay or fire doctors and nurses ? EDIT : that seems dramatic ... not `` fire '' them but they will basically go into another profession since they are no longer needed .
Well if mass public shootings are so rare and so unlikely to happen in the rest of the world , how do you explain the school shootings in Germany ? Furthermore , if public shootings are so damn rare , why did Germany make their already extremely strict gun control laws even stricter than ever ?
And that has happened in some cases . Mosquitoes are changing the development cycles to coincide with increasingly warmer temperatures . Fish species are enlarging their habitats as water temperatures rise . Many species are moving north as temperature rises .
Well first off , again , you asked a misleading question . Jesus did n't just happen in the last century , nor in the last decade . Besides , God Rapes an unmarried Jew and gets away with a violent crime ? ! ? And people wonder why I 'm such a skeptic . I 've never bought the whole `` emaculate conception '' jazz to begin with .
So you know what Ozzy was trying to say in his pointless statement ? How do you know your interpretation is correct while mine is wrong ? How exactly do you justify taking the word of a man who bit the head off of a bat , as something credible ?
So , one set of creationists are XXXXXX , but the others are not ?
So you think that , if murders were legal , there would still be the same number ? How about robberies , or rapes ? There are plenty of those , the law ca n't be having any effect ... In short , I 'm saying that making anything illegal reduces that thing . Criminalising murder results in less murder , criminalising drugs leads to reduced supply of drugs ( compare any drug with nicotine , or alcohol ) , and criminalising guns would lead to a similar reduction .
According to your logic , an infant would have no right to suck nutrients from a woman 's breast . Would you as quickly assert the mother has no duty to care for the infant ?
The only thing different there was skin color , the only thing different here is that it has no brain , no thinking skills , no memory , and no way to feel physical pain . You ca n't say that about the slaves .
I believe studies have already been done on that subject .
I believe you , OTHERS pick and choose what you believe . What is sad is how many lose their faith when they find how much they have been mislead .
We do n't live on carbon dioxide . We live from the energy stored in carbon compounds when we break them down .
Yet another example of a court ramming gay marriage down the public 's throats . I wonder how long it 'll take DC to generate a ballot initiative to reverse the court ?
Are n't you deifying it when you say : `` yep , that 's how He did it . Makes perfect sense . Dang , He 's smart . '' ? And if you care about Genesis at all then you 'd care about in whose image man is made .
Last I checked , drug prohibition began much earlier than the 1980s . The '80s fall in violent crime is more likely a result of the legalization of abortion than it is a result of the `` success of the war on drugs . ''

Now let 's compare that to the output in the one and only ID journal ( ISCID `` PCID '' ) over the last few years :
The idea here is to demonstrate that the odds of them realizing the same Genesis is impossible . That is unless God came back again , spoke his word into a book through the scribblings of random religious scholars . If you accept that this is inevitable , you are delusional . The most likely thing would be for humans to come up with an entirely different religious doctrine . I would be willing to bet that it would pass through polytheism into monotheism as more information became available and eventually we would end up right where we are now . The problem with this scenario is that evolution would probably never be confirmed since our biological history would not be apparent . We would come up with theories that God made us and perhaps even some screwballs would say we were all part of an experiment and were placed on the planet by our ancestors a couple hundred thousand years prior .
And if everything in our power fails and the fetus has a terminal condition that will threaten it 's own life and the life of it 's mother if it is born ? Making blanket statements such as yours ignores reality . Is it murder to save the life of the mother at the fetus ' expense ? This question of course ignores that murder can only occur if it is an illegal killing .
Because that 's the kind of thing Big Brother would do . Firearms are property , and IMHO a restriction such as that is too much .
OK , OK . This was not a very well thought out thread . Your points are extremely well taken . At the risk of quitting without putting up a even a little fight , I do n't see much valid argument behind my premise , so I concede .
Uh ... yeah ? Is there some other way than evolution this can happen ? Evolution encompasses speciation which results from evolution taking different paths when populations are separated by some factor in their environment or geographically . Are you saying you believe that the species have all somehow resulted from a common genome yet at the same time rejecting evolution as an explanation ?
if thats what we have to do to keep guns in the hands of americans then so be it .
I know of entire families in which the anestry is n't very tall at all , on both sides . As far back as the old timers can remember there has never been a Jones over 5'8 '' . All of a sudden one grew to 6'3 '' . How can this be ! ? ! ? ! ? ? The first 10 lizards did n't have cecal valves . This evolution theory really is going to put us back in the dark ages . When lizards morph in different environments and the explanation is mutating something that adds up to the mystical rapid evolution , rather than the common sense discoveries Mendel made . We are definately moving backwards . The bigger the BS the more the grant money from the US .
As I explained above , it is not reasonable to expect quality of life to take a backseat to the sanctity of life . Without quality of life , the sanctity of life is meaningless . Without life itself , quality is a non-issue .
Thus , the properties of the code allow it to maintain its own functional integrity . Also form the article :
oh really ? so u wud choose 2 have ... say ... a close friend or relative who has a disease that wud probably be cured by stem cell research , 2 die from it and choose 2 have a new baby be born , right ? well then , wat if it 's ur mom or dad ?
Actually when you read every thing you have to rationalize ( lie ) what God actually did , for God was done with everything then started again . THe stories do n't parallel each other they intersect .
If science deals with how information is gathered , different ways of analyzing , and different hypothesis , then it involves worldviews . The base for the worldview of a sizable part of the population should not be excluded . Maybe in Saddam Hussien 's Iraq , maybe in communist Russia , but not in the United States .
Evidence ? I did n't think so .
And of course , the sea of Montalban 's assertions as science , the sea of Montalban 's out of context quotes , or the sea of Montalban 's misrepresentations of what others have said . It seems that Montalban knows the `` TROOTH '' and wo n't be discouraged with facts . Sadly , Montalban knows what he believes and reality seems to be irrelevant .
And , as miller pointed out , that is how evolution works . Small changes from preexisting parts providing new function . In this case , the function was to beable to digest lactose.. a function that was not there before .
Because they do n't know any better . Besides , how many unwanted pregnancies have you had ? How many abortions ? Notice that most anti-choicers are men , which exposes the true hypocrisy in this dogma of thinking .
Since amniocentesis is done before a fetus has legal personhood aborting such a pregnancy is not mercy killing in any way . One can not show mercy to what constitutes mere tissue . One can show mercy to a human person . Suppose that the fetus in question has for example will have no functioning brain upon birth , then will aborting it constitute in any way the killing of a person . In sever anencephaly there is nothing there to be a person !
And your point is ? If you 're trying to go that since there are allegories in the Bible , then science does not contridict it , then you are clearly a revisionist who is warping and distorting the bible to suit a specific agenda .
Cost would certainly be an issue . If the adoptive parents were willing to take on that cost , that would be best . I wonder , though , how much demand there really is out there for adopted babies . As I understand the situation , currently there are far more parents looking to adopt than there are new babies up for adoption . However , if such an artificial womb would exist , then that may not be the case any longer . Would the mother then have to be responsible ? Not that easy a case to ponder since that would be a case of performing abortion not purely out of a sense of a woman 's right over her own body ( since transfer would be an option ) but out of purely financial , practical reasons .
Of course everyone has some basis for their views . Not even denying that . However there are ways that using that `` basis '' most certainly is an imposition and the gay rights battle is a prime example . There are many , many , many people who have done work to stop/block gay marriage and other gay rights when they , themselves , are not gay . That is not merely passing judgement - that is imposition . All I am asking here is that Archie , you , JP , etc . own that .
Oh yeah , like the televangelist shows . Come on , get real . Maybe they should give God credit for things because He is omnipotent and omnipresent . Maybe because He created us to love Him and serve Him . Maybe because He has blessed America in so many ways !
Well Steve `` murder '' is a legal term that does not apply in abortion . But for the sake of keeping this simple - yes , and not only that , it 's legal .
Well , there 's tons of oxygen dissolved in sea water and you ca n't get it hotter than 100C . Done .
So no eyebrows are raised ?
Can you prove to me without any doubt that I am talking to you . I could really be your imagination talking to you , answering your own question in some weird , perverse way . I am merely an illusion , your sub-conscious . Point being : asking for 100 % proof or you do n't buy it is sophistry -- very close to solipsism , in fact , and was discredited as a theory of epistemology many thousands of years ago .
There 's absolutely no way in hell this could be legal in any sense . That California school got ***** slapped for expelling a student who had a gun off campus , beyond the jurisdictional reach of the school . So how can this school believe they can get away with such an insane policy ?
Well , I think it is best to use a real source . Like the Australian FBI , called the A.I.C.. The latest figures . Violent crimes from 1996 to 2007 ( per 100,000 persons per year ) Homicide is pretty much a flat line no ? However there violent crime is not . And to be fair , Australia 's murder rate has always been significantly lower then ours and they should be congratulated for there socialization for it too . So if gun related crime goes down but the murder rate remains relatively flat , but other violent crimes go up , then what is thew point of mentioning that GUN Related crime went down ?
But still , if you think there are rights in the bill of rights that is wrong , that should not be granted or guaranteed , it would be a viable option to vote for removing them . What debate are you trying to end here ? The debate : 'do you want little or less gun-control ' ?
So the fact that it is not legally recognized is the problem . What is the reason it 's not legally recognized ? Because the couple is gay .
Yes .
Really ? Then you need a better sparring partner to sharpen your thinking .
Maybe sentient would have been a better word to use . In a nutshell my position is it is no more immoral to kill a baby before it becomes sentient ( if there are good reasons to do so ) then it is to euthanatize a dog at the dog pound .
Are you saying that without emotional investment in not believing in evolution , evolution makes sense ?
In the split second something happens , we must protect ourselves .
And how have I deprived you of your right to teach your religion to your children in your home and in your church . How does an objection against the imposition of your religion by force of the government deprive you of your rights . I can certainly see how the imposition of your religion would deprive me of my right to the free exercise of my own religion , but why do you feel that you have a right to impose your religion on me ?
And therefore a transitional by definition .
tortured ? you shut ur mouth.. , ... if ur not achristian then yes , i will pray for you ... .
And I just say that it would be unjust and unfair of you to force metaphysical belief systems of your own which constitute religious belief upon your follows who may believe otherwise than you . Get pregnant and treat your fetus as a full person if you wish , nobody will force you to abort it . Let others follow their own beliefs differing or the same . Otherwise you attempt to obtain justice by doing injustice.Mo
Well you 've made a good point ; just because something is banned or made illegal does n't mean that it 'll have an affect on reducing the numbers .
And how is this a bad thing ?
Bertvan : Does this self-organization force whip up complex features intelligently and purposefully ? Or does it whip them up by some unknown deterministic process in which creativity is somehow achieved by accident ?
Oh , do n't be so hasty Bear in mind that at the scale upon which bacteria operate , molecules are significant physical structures . The bacterial flagellum , for instance , is an outboard motor constructed directly out of proteins , which are in turn directly , physically translated via RNA from DNA sequences . The physical shape of the folded molecular structure of those proteins is what makes the motor work . So there 's nothing abstract about the relationship between DNA and the organism 's physical form or abilities .
So , you 're just an anti-geologist , anti-cosmologist , anti-archaeologist , anti-physicist , and probably a few more that I ca n't be arsed to think of right now . *shrugs* Might as well get it over with and just say you 're an anti-science religious nutter .
Give me three good reasons why a thirteen year old girl from Plam Beach , that are practial not religous please , should not have an abortion and I will promise not to make fun of you . Much . Judges do this everyday . This case just made the news .
You can have reasoned faith , but it need not rely on 'empirical ' evidence . There are very many forms of evidence .
No , back to school ... turn in what educational credntials you feel you have , and just stay at the coffeehouses ... at least you have a .005 % of hearing someone ineject some truth in one of those sidewalk tete a ' tete 's you nutters are so fond of ... but here you are dead wrong . Have you ever heard of an egg ? ever heard of a sperm ? An egg is still considered a multiple cell organism , and a sperm as well . You 're gon na have a hard time pulling that one off .
Yes , it is . ( *see below )
Heart bypass , prostate cancer ... ... .I have a couple of Canadian friends who needed those surgeries and one was told he had a 4 month wait and the other a 6 month wait so they both came down to Bellingham Wash and had the Surgery within 2 weeks ... ... ... ...
The Due Process Clause is cited in response to the pro-life assertion that the gov't should have the power to force a woman to donate bodily resources against her will and without her consent .
Actually , the fossil record does support it . Both Eldredge and Gould have discussed it . Both men made observations of slow gradual speciation in the fossil record in a small geographical area . These changes were reflected at other locations as an abrupt change from one species to another . But given that such changes take place very quickly in populations that are usually under environmental stress and isolated from the main population , and given the rarity of fossilization in the first place , we do n't expect to find many examples in the fossil record . It is a bit like trying to time a 100 yd . dash with a sundial . The fossil record just is n't fine grained enough to see the rapid ( 50-60 thousand years ) changes .
Care to , uh , back up your facts ?
But not just any seven judges , seven judges who 's job is to define the constitution .
A beneficial effect . Ever hear of testosterone replacement therapy ?
Because it 's all quite clear . Decades of effort from the religious right , conservative republicans , and their like have made gay rights a poisoned topic . It 's a tragedy , but saying the right thing on this issue will cost you more votes than it will gain you , everyone knows it , and no one is going to do it . It 's politics 101 . The democrats , as a whole , want to do the right thing , but they know that if they say so too loudly they wo n't be in a position to do anything . They 're forced to moderate their public stances so that they can get into positions where they can actually take action . This is of course a generalization , but if you 're talking about a political party as a whole that 's unavoidable . Generally speaking dems do n't trumpet gay rights because they know how many votes it 'll cost them , and thus prevent them from actually working for gays rights . Reps do n't trumpet gay right because they do n't support gay rights . This is the common political wisdom , and if you want to show that it does n't apply to a specific individual you need to make the case for that individual .
They also went through the `` stage '' of being an unfertilized ovum .
Actually I pretty much agree with you here . Sex means possible pregnancy . If you do n't want it there 's condoms , birth control pills , and the morning-after pill . You should n't have sex without some sort of birth control if you do n't want a kid , seems like common sense to me .
i think slave holder 's asked a similar question to people who believed slavery was wrong . `` what are they worth anyways ? ? why do they deserve to be treated like us ? '' hmm
Actually it is events like these that led the two most exhaustive studies ever done gun control to conclude this . 51 of the best gun control studies the WORLD had to offer
Yes you did , your very own god that fits what you wish to believe . It is not the God of Abraham , Issac and Jacob . He believed Moses was a real person and Genesis was history . Mat 8:4 And Jesus saith unto him , See thou tell no man ; but go thy way , shew thyself to the priest , and offer the gift that Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them . Mat 17:3 And , behold , there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him . Mat 17:4 Then answered Peter , and said unto Jesus , Lord , it is good for us to be here : if thou wilt , let us make here three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias . Mat 19:7 They say unto him , Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement , and to put her away ? Mat 19:8 He saith unto them , Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives : but from the beginning it was not so . Mat 22:24 Saying , Master , Moses said , If a man die , having no children , his brother shall marry his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother . Mat 23:2 Saying , The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses ' seat Mar 1:44 And saith unto him , See thou say nothing to any man : but go thy way , shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them . Mar 7:10 For Moses said , Honour thy father and thy mother ; and , Whoso curseth father or mother , let him die the death : Mar 9:4 And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses : and they were talking with Jesus . Mar 9:5 And Peter answered and said to Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias . Mar 10:2 And the Pharisees came to him , and asked him , Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife ? tempting him . Mar 10:3 And he answered and said unto them , What did Moses command you ? Mar 10:4 And they said , Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement , and to put her away . Mar 10:5 And Jesus answered and said unto them , For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept . Mar 12:26 And as touching the dead , that they rise : have ye not read in the book of Moses , how in the bush God spake unto him , saying , I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? Yes the God of the Bible did not see Moses as a mythical science fiction writer as you do . Why do you consider yourself a Christian if you consider Jesus Christ a liar and a fool ? You may notice I have not used the Old Testement at all here . You have to dismiss the entire Bible out of hand to believe in evolution . It is a conscious choice you make every day .
And for years they did . They still can . Again , there is not a real problem with pirates .
Yes and no
Well , this is not very surprising coming from Brownback . I live in Kansas City Missouri , but work over on the Kansas side , so I know plenty about Brownback . He 's been quite a bastard toward gay related issues over the years , and I think the same goes for abortion in his case . If he 's the Republican nominee for the presidential election , boy am I voting Democrat just on that principle , not to mention the fact I have n't voted Republican since George W. You know , maybe they should question judges that have attended hetero marriages as to their impartiality as well as those who attend churches that vocally state their anti-gay views . EDIT : Yep , just checked , and he IS strongly pro-life , having referred to the amount of abortions in the United States since Roe V. Wade as `` a holocaust '' , and is also one of the Kansas officials in favor of teaching Intelligent Design alongside Evolution . He also opposes stem cell research .
And what does that have to do with the price of rice in China ? Are you suggesting that in the event of a natural disaster you have the right to choose ? If a tornado tore you from your bed and cast you into oblivion , that was your choice ? Maybe so . No doubt many lives were lost in NO due to lack of means as well as ignorance but how that relates to convenience abortion on demand and the social acceptance of them escapes me .
And this is what it devolves down into .
lol ... you read my whole post only to conclude with `` what 's your point . '' Evolutionist brilliance on display . I 'm not mistaking nothing for nothing . I know my stuff . You obviously know nothing and do n't care to learn it .
But it did have ( if we are talking the very first non-unicellular organisms ) tiny ickle wickle bits and pieces that eventually became what we call 'organs ' . Seriously , if you ca n't answer my questions above then you have no business questioning the theory , because if you do n't know what the theory says , how can you argue against it ? Your questions in this thread make no sense because they do not even address the issues from the standpoint of what is already known .
Again , I think this to be relevant for the same reason as I think the consent issue to be relevant . Thomson 's argument is an appeal to moral intuition . We are told the violinist must be bed-ridden for nine months in order to support the violinist . This scenario presents one gut reaction . But , if we change the scenario to say that , though the violinst must be connected for nine months , the donor is not bed-ridden , and in fact experiences no ill effects save ( to draw as close a comparison to pregnancy as possible ) the same ill effects of pregnancy ( morning sickness , etc . ) , then I think another gut reaction arises . Thomson 's appeal , as far as I can tell , is purely to our intuition . The force of her argument relies on the fact that we must place ourselves in the position of the donor , and presumably , when we do we find it unacceptable for the donor not to have the choice to disconnect the violinist . However , using the same line of argument , if we present the argument as I have suggested ( that is , relating it as closley to pregnancy as possible ) , a different outcome likely arises . That is , given that the time of connection is limited to nine months , that either voluntary or passive consent was given , and that the only ill-effects suffered are the same ill-effects experienced during pregnancy , I think the donor is morally obligated to continue the support of the violinist . And , as I suggested above , I think the intuitions of the majority of people support this conclusion , seeing how they seem to believe that abortion should be subjected to more restrictions than is currently the case .
So my question is this : Why does n't a chihuahua birthe a Siberian husky in the Antarctic , or even in Siberia ? Oh , my other question is this : Why do animals die young instead of adapt ?

So a free society is one where the goverment does not have tabs on their citizens ? How could then the goverment work when it does not know who they actually govern ? The foundation of economics is that you have correct data , else it´s the beginning of corruption not freedom . And since when was there a dichotomy between freedom and socialism ? Further how does the usage of identification ease the rounding up of suspects ? Wouldn´t it be rather MORE risk to be rounded up if you couldn´t identify yourself and thus automatically become suspect than be able to and take yourself out of the calculation ?
So you 're admitting that Sarah Brady intentionally committed a straw purchase of a firearm , especially one that can be modified and turned into a long range sniper rifle .
And religion is what caused the Crusades and most other wars in the past , and many wars , and bloody disputes , to this very day . Many , many , many , many , many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called `` in the name of atheism '' .
well , it is irrational if you believe that human life is a good thing . Some people tend to think that it is ok to degrade people because it 1 ) makes economic sense 2 ) cuts down on the population 3 ) makes THEIR life easier . However , when you degrade people you make society worse off ... so I really do n't see a point . Nice to see you here by the way .
No ... it is n't . The consequences of something do not become strawmen ... Here is an article that talks about the consequences ( so called strawmen ) of universal healthcare http : //www.heartland.org/policybot/r ... el_for_US.html
Well , Jeff , may I suggest this is just ppart of the next step in the disarming of America . 'We tried Brady , it 's not good enough , therefore , we must step up the attacks with even more stringent legislation . Understand , The VPC isan organization of Gun Grabbers , as well .
I would agree with you , but first of all , the owner of the show has every right to not allow cameras . Second , it would be a huge invasion of privacy if all women knew what their ex wives could keep spying on what they buy and what they do . They have no buisness doing that .
Wow Ethmi almost sounds like we had the same mother , because I know exactly what you are saying .
And certain versions of Mark : 15He said to them , Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation . 16Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved , but whoever does not believe will be condemned . 17And these signs will accompany those who believe : In my name they will drive out demons ; they will speak in new tongues ; 18they will pick up snakes with their hands ; and when they drink deadly poison , it will not hurt them at all ; they will place their hands on sick people , and they will get well. Are they mistakenly reading this ?
Jesus Christ ! ( Pun intended ) That 's not anger , I 'm saying that he made a vague statement and he should elaborate on it . Someone could believe in some of the teachings of Jesus , but not be a Christian . Someone can believe in everything Jesus said except for him being the Son of God , and not be a Christian .
Yes , this is what I 'm saying . The `` soul '' and the `` spirit '' are the whole point of the bible 's existence . if it ca n't be plain about what they are and what to do with them , then either god is a terrible author , or ( and this is the one you 'll like ) we are terrible readers . Either way , god is n't making the instructions very clear .
Oh , I 'm betting the usage will go up , if only temporarily when it 's legalized . I know several people who would be smoking now if it was n't illegal . Employers would likely counter this with more testing of employees and applicants . Users would probably smoke more often and in more places than they now do . I would become a chain-smoker ! LOL
Yes , although that line changes over time .
Stated above .
A free country where gays are n't free to marry ( legally ) ? All of you against gay marriage realize that gays are married NOW , do n't you ? They get rings and everything and even adopt kids . It 's all legal and happening right now . Scared ? Is your marriage less valid or degraded ? Is your life affected one bit ? .
Well , at some point they are sentient beings ( surely you agree ) , that 's the point that the fetus becomes a person in my opinion . Before that it 's not really too bad . I do n't have a problem with people `` having sex in an improper way '' or choosing to `` screw each other how they would like to screw each other '' . I do have a problem with people creating a feeling being and then killing it , as is the case when fetuses become sentient and are aborted . You also say that it is my opinion , which it is , but it is also your opinion . You have said that women who have abortion because they ar n't responsible are making bad decisions .
No one mentioned helping or not helping people here , or even dealing with the consquences of pregnancy at all . Its more ; 'If abortion were banned , what measures or research would you suggest to reduce the pressure for people to have illegal ones or unwanted pregnancies ' .
If you dont believe that muslims love life they will cut your head right off ! Its an easy choice if you ask me .
The Jews , for the vast majority of them ( there are some minor exceptions ) , take Genesis figuratively .
Care to post a link ? Because I googled `` Vitter admits to adultery '' and came up with zero results about this story . And can you show where he is a fundamentalist christian and not just a conservative Republican ? And I find it very hypocritical how frenzied your side can become at his admitted personal sin when in regards to your own personal values system adultery is n't considered sinning at all . If he admitted to sodomy , would you also make an issue of that which you consider totally normal activity ? And ca n't you see the hypocricy and double standard by throwing such stones in the face of seeking acceptance of your lifestyle ? If I were to put myself in your place , would n't it have made more sense to attempt to justify his actions as a non issue in order to show that we are all alike and criticizing any sexual standards of right and wrong is damaging to the human condition ? Again , I ask , where is the consistency in your thinking ?
First of all why would you want to know if I have an alternative theory to one that is known to be false ? Are you found of false theories ? A true theory would be a replacement not an alternative . The Wrong Answer Will Always Be The Wrong Answer ! If evolution was true there would be overwhelming , uncontestable evidence , there is no uncontestable evidence . Little that is any more than pure imagination . Theories start out as hypothesis and are then subject to experimentation and observation . When they fail they are discarded . For instance spontaneous generation was disproved by Pasteur and discarded as a theory . Evolution which is not a theory , although it is called one , has been falsified nine ways to Sunday . Two of Darwin 's own falsifications have come to pass and ignored . The Galopagos Finches have proven to interbreed which destoys a great deal of the so called basis of his theory . `` Extinct '' animals and plants are found alive and ignored as evidence against evolution . Theories are made to be challenged but evidence against evolution is suppressed . Evolutionist had to revive spontaneous generation although it is scientifically impossible because without it atheism is impossible . The atheist must have a story no matter how bizzare to justify his faith . Science suffers because of this . My theory is that this planet is exactly what Einstein said it was , a place designed by a Supreme Being to be inhabited by people . The evidence is creation itself . If there is a creation there must be a Creator . Nothing has ever been observed to self assemble and there is no known process that could accomplish that . Animals and plants just like the ones alive today have always existed . Many have gone extinct but death is not evidence of evolution . Human beings are incapable of creating a grain of sand from nothing . There are grains of sand so there is an intelligence greator than ours that did . The perfect balance seen in the anthropic principle tells of a Creator . The unbelievable complexity of the human body makes evolution impossible . DNA can not exist without proteins . Proteins are coded by the information in the DNA molecule . They had to come into being simultaneously . Pre-biotic natural selection is impossible , there is no process to affect the evolution of DNA outside of a living organism . To look at a building is to have absolute empirical proof there was a builder . To look at creation and say there was no Creator is to enter an intellectually free zone .
So , because they do n't interpret the bible as you do , they believe that there are no deities ? That is what you said ...
Oh come on Steeeeve , around 50 % of fertilized embroyo 's will fail to implant anyway , so nature 'has killed/'is killing ' half of all the people who have ever existed anyway . You can not tell me that none of those are not just fluke losses of otherwise perfectly healthly embryos . Also , prevention of implantation is only one of several mechanisms by which emergency contraception works- it also prevents ovulation , disrupts passage of a released egg and inhibits fertilzation occuring in the first place .
I know ! How dare they just not sit back and accept the discrimination they so rightly deserve . It 's just incredible the amount physical and emotional damage you would undergo if these people are given the same kind of respect you are . We ca n't have that ! This may be a a government for the people , and I am sorry but you are only part of the people and to be granted the respect of people if you screw and love the people that the majority say you have to screw and love . God bless er Buddha bless er Mohammed bless ... er Rhiannon bless America !
What difference would that make ? The BATFE ( E for explosives , their power grows ) already knows you own a firearm if you 've ever had a NICS check . They 're supposed to destroy the records , but who knows what they do ? Might as well let it be known you have some personal experiance in this area . Gives you better grounds for debate than 'Joe Foreigner ' who has never owned or possibly even seen a real firearm in person . Being part of the crowd and looking in from the outside make big differences when it comes to understanding .
Well it seems as if he is referring to the origin of man , I would like to do a debate on teaching creation ( or ID if you want ) in schools ( science class specifically ) . If you ( Marc9000 ) want to do this after your debate with DamEtal or at the same time ( but that would be kind of hard ) or if anyone else wants to do this I 'm trying to do my first formal debate . I start school tommorrow and play baseball so I may also have limited time during the week , but I could find time especially if I only needed one per week . I would want to take the negative where the statement is `` creationism ( or Intelligent Design ) should be taught in science class in public schools . '' I hope either marc9000 or someone else will take me up on this . If you want to wait until the end of the debate with DamEtel that 's fine as well .
Well , they still do account for a fair bit of our observations of evolution . The discovery that RNA may be more significant than previously thought only adds to the explanatory power of the ToE - I 'm not sure why you , a creationist , would find this such an attractive prospect .
I think if that happened , Texas probably will go back to being the lone star state .
No , persecution of anyone preaching hate against anyone .
Well , respectfully I have to disagree with you ( and I know you are n't surprised ) . I 've thought this over pretty thoroughly and I believe that the will of the American people is ultimately a pretty good standard to what we should institute in this country when it comes to moral issues . After all , if enough of the public had not been behind them , civil rights for black people would never have come about , nor women 's suffrage . In my opinion , we do n't give the American people nearly enough credit to assume they ca n't be trusted with issues like this . Maybe , just maybe , the reason that many American people think gay marriage is wrong is simply because it IS . But I can tell you that I believe strongly enough in the American system that if enough of the public get behind gay marriage and support it to the point where it becomes legal in all the states , I would accept that as what America wants . What I do n't accept is judges ( individuals ) deciding these issues , even going so far as to go against the American people . That is a VERY dangerous precedent that is much more monarchial than anything .
I 'll wait for you to explain to what miracles you are referring before responding to this statement .
Correct . The National Guard is nothing more than an 'extension ' of the Federal Army ( and Air Force ) . We wear the same uniform as our active duty counterparts as well . You may recall that back in the 60 's Gov . George Wallace was powerless to stop the 'Federalization ' of National Guard troops which were used against him , by forcing the desegregation of Alabama schools . Regardless of where you stand on the politics of that situation , the Federal government clearly overstepped their authority here and thus established their control over 'National Guard ' units henceforth . The National Guard being referred to as the 'militia ' is laughable and wholly inaccurate . It 's a cop out used by anti-gunners to excuse their attempts to disarm the 'law abiding ' .
Sometimes ? The state of the public education system in the US is downright criminally neglectful .
Yes but as you know some breasts resemble some sponges its not too big a jump to get from one to the other and of course there are other spongy tissues derived in the same way . This was all published as an appendix to the Book of Official Rules which is an addendum to The One True Book of the Round Church of which I am the hereditary pope . However I have lent my copy out and its not available on the web .
Did you have your gun on you ?
So it 's not safe to go to school because your teacher might kill you if you 're late at turning in your homework ? Incidents such as the shooter professor are incredibly rare ; you 'll find very few school teachers that were convicted of murder during a previous date , and released from prison due to a favor from a politician . But incidents like the one in the UK , where the aggressor is in less trouble than their intended victim , are far more common and close to the norm for the country . If you 're attacked , you 're guilty if you fight back and cause either harm or fear to the person attacking you . Even if they assault you with a deadly weapon , you 're the guilty party if you manage to cause them any sort of harm .
I 'm sorry , but I thought it went without saying that we were discussing human life .
And do n't forget the part that we 're all hot for her , too .
OH get off it ! ! ! ! How many times have we seen the argument from your side that gay marriage would increase the incidence of AIDS ?
Under then bill pushed through in the middle of the night : 1.a healthy 25-year-old in Milwaukee will see his costs rise by 178 % . 2.A small business in Richmond with eight employees will see a 23 % increase . 3.Insurance for a 40-year-old family with two kids in Indianapolis will pay 106 % more 4.Collection of payroll taxes for the new plan will begin Jan. 2010 , but benefits do n't start until 2014 . 5 . Payment to doctors for Medicare patients will decrease 21.5 % next year and more after that . How many doctors do you think will continue to treat Medicare patients when that happens ? 6 . The plan will cost $ 871Billion over the next decate , but 98 % of the cost occurs after 2014 . 7 . Medical device manufacturers pay $ 2Billion/year in taxes . This will rise to $ 3Billion/year in 2018 , removing $ 1Billion that could be used for R & amp ; D and adding it to the cost of current devices instead . 8 . The rest of the country will pay ALL of Nebraska 's state contributions to Medicare FOREVER because that was the bribe that the Democrats made for the 60th vote . Now , Cake Lady , prove me wrong !
Showing the RIDICULOUS nature of some gun laws ! Even the Antis ca n't ( or maybe wo n't ) obey them ! Ridiculous paperwork traps that even caught and surprised the Queen of gun control ! If they had arrested her , they would have gotten a Real criminal off the streets and NOW our society would have finally been safe ! Ridiculous ! But it was a good thing for her , that Bloomburg and his Illegal Mayors were n't around when she broke America 's gun laws !
Everything basically . You 're held captive by hostile natives that have set up barricades and checkpoints around the property you live on . They decide when you get to come in and go out , and the police have decided to abandon you rather than come to your aid . And Canada has laws that make defense with a firearm either impractical or out right illegal depending on just where you life .
Nice try . If America was an Ally to Germany during WWII , to this day you would n't forgive US Citizens no matter what excuse they have .
Surely this question be easy enough to answer . Any rational thinking thiest want to give my question a shot ?
The article cautions on blithely using natural selection as an explanation for the features of the genetic code . Article 9 : In this article , the functional integrity and how the architecture of the code relates to it is discussed . From the article :
But you need proof to back up a explantion . If you did n't , all you 'd have a creationism . Explanations without any support .
If our guns are mearly popguns as you just described them , then why do you want to take them from us so badly . Maybe you are considering a life of crime as a carrer , and your afraid of being shot , is that whats really going on here .
But you debate with it ?
So your claim is that the laws of physics have changed ? You see , it is not a matter of design . It is a matter of the physical limits of wood . Wood is flexable , and the longer the piece of wood , the more bend there is in it . Possibly you have seen a roof with wood supports that spans a large area . To do it requires huge trusses unless you add column supports . And I 'll bet there are n't any spans of over 300 ft. where only a wood truss is used . For a ship/barge the problem becomes worse . If you make the keel thick in an effort to reduce the hogging and snaking , you reduct the room available inside . Even at that , it would be impossible to eliminate all of the flexing and that flexing would spring the planks of the hull . There is no calking that has been devised that can fill an ever changing gap between planks . And , of course , recourse to a miracle is the standard creationist answer when faced with evidence that their mythology is n't historic . `` POOF ! Goddidit ! '' And so , what is the point of the whole exercise in the first place ? Why did n't God just POOF the ark into existance or just POOF anyone he did n't like out of existance ? He wanted to teach the only just man in the world a lesson ? Sure worked . First thing Noah did was to get drunk .
You mean on the road shared with the adjacent property they claim as tribal land ?
Yep , he dodged it again . Care to explain your views on Creation in the Tanakh for the folks here ?
Another wild-butt theory from the radical left . Liberals do love their Michael Moore theories . So prove it .
Male
Again ! No , but I like to think they are !  All you mean is that you dont like us a ) from some twisted sense of patriotism , and b ) because were central in politics compared to Americas right spectrum shift ...
jessica , all these problems you 've listed , the human body takes care of automatically and remarkably well . the fact still remains that only less than 5 % of all abortions occur because the risk is great enough to be deemed life-threatening to either tha mother or the child . and that percentage is diminishing as well . the overwhelming majority of abortions occur simply because the woman decides she does not wnat to be a mother .
Why bother when you know logic , rational thinking and womens rights always take second seat to antiquated belief system dogma ?
Guess what , I 'm pro-life as well , that is why I 'm also pro-choice .
You presume correctly , sir . Overall the USSR could produce almost the same level of technology the US could during the cold war ; however the restrictive nature of Soviet society during that time I believe quashed the possibility of many bright Soviet citizens to be better educated , and eliminated the possibility that many of them could reach their potential . I hope the situation is improving there ; guess we 'll find out in 50 years . Another factor that contributed was the fact that there are more remote and undeveloped areas in the former USSR than in the US , which supports the idea that parts of the Soviet Union were ( and may still be ) less developed .
The NT was compiled in the late 4th Century AD , being criticised at the time for the overtly political choice of which texts were included as Canon and which were rejected to become the Apocrypha . Further it is now generally accepted that the text was altered at a later date to comply with OT prophesy . Like The Saxon Chronicles , King Arthur or Robin Hood there is too much romanticisation and mythologising to be certain of virtually anything in the text .
Well , it stated that they would not be forced to have an abortion , but would be held in contempt of court . Was what he said wrong only because he is trying to intrude on their private lives , or because he felt that the couple should not have any more children put onto the taxpayer 's backs ? Is this necessarily a liberal view ?
You have n't defined that yet . Therefore I can not answer .
Well , then you disagree with almost all the state amendments . You must be out of step with your party ...
And better yet , ask Sinjin what he and his cohorts are doing to teach gun safety ? How much did he and or the Anti-gun orgs spend ? The NRA spent more then 20 MILLION Dollars to teach children to STOP ! DO N'T TOUCH , LEAVE THE AREA , TELL AN ADULT ! The NRA probably could and would do more however , EVEN JUST THAT , is called indoctrination by the Anti-gun crowed , and apparently even Sinjin ! So is the criticism fair ? Is the comparison he made fair ?
So having guns is not part of being armed ?
JUST a theory ? Gravity is a theory . You do n't think electricity exists ? Wow . The person before answered your questions clear enough , I just wanted to point that out .
I 've never been to Amsterdam . A friend of mine went and he liked it . I 'd like to go someday . Hell , I 'd just like to get my XXX anywhere , really .
The paradox on creation is that it is obessed with proving scientific concepts wrong without taking the time to even understand the basics of how it works . The analogy here is arguing that quantum physics is wrong without understand the basics of how force or momentum operate .
That 's not true . You asked standard creationist questions with a standard creationist attitude . Your views are pretty clear from the smartass way you asked and your final comment .
This is n't my position . I 'm arguing that your attempts to demonize magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds is foolish . Furthermore , if no honest citizen needs a 15 round magazine , then no police officer needs them either . If we can reload them quickly enough for it to not matter , then the police can do it too .
No need to read any farther , the expert has spoken from his small shell of ignorance : coyote attacks in california - Google Search He does n't mind if they eat kids and their pets or someone else . He can outrun almost any child .
First of all , gun violence is no joke , but your figures are way too high if you are talking about criminal gun violence . Which is the subject of this group of threads . But you guys push for stuff that will have little to no impact on gun violence . Stuff like an Assault Weapons ban . So called Assault Weapons even if were dis-invented would have less impact than lets say murders committed by beating people to death with hands , and feet . Which by the way , also shows the futility of banning guns in the first place . Brady , I have shown you who commits murder . You are NEVER going to stop all of that by punishing those who do n't take drugs , or sell them , or commit crimes . If you were actually serious about doing what you say you want to do , you would be designing and pushing for resolutions to deal with the actual evidence . Let me also show you what the FBI says are the pertinent factors . Crime factors from the FBI website
Well some of ROCC 's comments were addressing issues that lead to unplanned pregnancy . Sexual promiscuity does lead to pregnancy , an increased rate of sex will increase the rate of pregnancies , even when birth control is a factor . I do recognize that there are other problems involved with unplanned pregnancies and issues should be dealt with , though apparently the responsibility of creating solutions to these issues is given primarily to pro-life supporters . There are two main issues that have to be dealt with ; reducing the amount of un-planned pregnancies , and giving more options to people who have an un-planned pregnancy . Now this may differ country to country depending on the social services that are available to support an unplanned pregnancy . Desperate action can not justify making morally objective issues legal , and i say morally objective since I 'm sure any sane person will agree that taking away the life of an innocent person is morally objective . Governments could make a lot of money on taxing narcotics to people who wish to take use in them , though this does not justify legalizing narcotics . Desperate drug addicts will be lead to desperate situations of theft in which they even may morally object to , but must partake in in order to feed their drug addiction . Even in the case of underground back-alley abortion clinics , they were just as safe as abortions are today , and have n't been any more dangerous since the invention of antibiotics and anesthetics . These procedures , though underground , were performed by qualified physicians who either believed that women should have the choice to kill their unborn child , or just realize that there was a small demand to do so . ( The actual statistic on the demand that were presented in Roe vs. Wade were fabricated by the pro-choice community ten times the actual value ) If you require me to prove or source any of this information , I would be glad to provide it .
yes , but adam wasnt created with hereditary information or from sperm and egg cells . adam was the prototype . any subsequent humans should be born following the fashion in which adam was made . otherwise adam could have been shaped like a goat and still bear human children , because god could have formed him into whatever shape or lack of shape he wanted , yet put the genetic information in him to produce human offspring . why should adam 's children look like adam ? wouldnt adam 's children be born the way adam was created , or not ?
I 've tried to be `` intellectually honest '' with you as well as patient with your `` fuzzy '' thinking and propensity to paste and interpret .
actually they probably drifted much faster than that ... ..probably upon a pole reversal .
Helpful mutations
Manslaughter involves a direct action that causes an unintentional death . Miscarriage is involuntary ; besides the person suffering a miscarriage might well want to keep the baby . To equate miscarriage with manslaughter is preposterous .
Most people are not pro-abortion , they are pro-choice . No one here is going around demanding that women must have abortions .
Sounds pretty neat . I 've never been there but I 'll keep it in mind for a road trip some time . So you are of the belief that dinosaurs and man lived at the same time ? I know that there are people who believe in this but I do n't come across them very often . So what information do you have to share with us about this idea ?
Up for parole in 15 years ? well about 14 by now ? and with records like that.I 'm not telling anyone to , but me personally I 'd find something on the blackmarket . When it takes 9 hours for the police to get around to it , face the horror , your just on your own .
You know that , I know that , but the creationists do not know that .
Probably because buildings are n't biological or reproductive .
Just like it 's the job of the gun control lobby to try and pass an overwhelming , unreasonable level of fear of an inanimate object ?
Nobody 's armed in England , but the criminals still go armed . What 's your excuse for that ?
Well , let 's see . 1 This is a skull from a modern human , the differences representing pathological deformities . 2 The dating is based on disputed methodology . Creation scientists have proved that radioisotope dating is unreliable . 3 The two pieces are only assumed to be from the same individual . 4 Where 's the conclusive DNA evidence ? ( A nod to easyrider on the Religion board . ) 5 These claims are made by scientists , and all science is an atheistic conspiracy against religion ( thank you marc9000 ) . 6 So where 's the missing link between the new fossil and us ? Huh ? Huh ? Sadly , past experience suggests that creationists can wriggle on indefinitely .
But you are trying to debunk the theory , right ? If it can be accepted by atheists , agnostics , theists , and the catholic church , how can you say that it is completely atheistic ?
What in the name of heaven is `` passive particulate selection '' is that found in quantitative genetics in some obscure corner - I challenge you to produce a reference to the term in the open literature . And Mendel 's theory was itself ( if anything is ) particulate in nature and it was NOT derived from Darwin at all . It preceded Darwin and later of course DID serve as a plug in addition to supplant Darwins own inadequate theory of inheritance . And of course Mendel is long ago supplanted by much more detailed and modern genetic knowledge . As to `` dynamic sytemic adaptation '' I also suggest you need to document where that term originates from other than yourself . Just what does that mean which is NOT covered by the vary-select-inherit process ? Please tell us oh mighty lagomorph how antibiotic resistance arises by `` dynamic systemic adaptation '' instead of plain old VSI processes and how you distinguish the two . [ QUOTEHave to go now . [ /quote ] Good because my tolerance for people who pontificate in pseudoscientific terms while pretending to themselves that they know what they are talking about is wearing very very thin .
Well , I 'm not sure the principles of physics and such would be any different - surely God could make them the way they are now and suspend them at will . That said , it seems reasonable , from a biological/geological perspective , that the following observations would be made : 1 . There would be a single mass extinction event for ALL flora and fauna , not numerous , asynchronous extinctions in differing environments encompassing particular groups of creatures 2 . This mass extinction would coincide with a single , large , relatively uniform stratum of a more or less heterogeneous composition , or perhaps a very few strata still with the same basic property , not numerous discontinuous strata 3. there would be numerous complete fossils of all creatures living at the time , to include soft-bodied creatures ( since rapid burial followed by fossilization is much more likely to preserve soft tissues either via imprints or actual fossilization ) 4. the complete fossils should all be found in contemporaneous strata , i.e. , human fossils should be found in the same layers as dinosaurs 5 . The biological species concept should be very simple to define , as all living ( and extinct ) creatures would be , first of all , much less diverse , and each 'kind ' would be simple to classify 6. there would be no reason to find , or even to expect to find , a unity of basic forms or functions or genomic content in extant creatures ( e.g. , no 'universal ' genetic code , mammals with more or less than 4 limbs , etc . ) Well , that is a few off the top of my head ...
Right . I 'll go with the observational data every time . I do n't think that mythology has much bearing on reality .
So what you 're saying is that by mentioning both in the same post , I 'm saying that unless someone is a YEC then they are n't a christian ? Because that is what you attributed to me . Yet you have yet to post evidence of me saying that to anyone . Nor have you supported your original claim here , you said this : Last I checked , no credible fossil fuel firm hired YEC geologists . Prove this assertion since you researched it thoroughly enough to start a thread about .
So tell me ... .knowing that the human race is 99.9 % the same , and that `` No matter how scientists today scrutinize a person 's genes , they ca n't determine with certainty whether an individual is from one `` racial '' group or another '' ... .how can you justify how the racist scientists can hold up a skull and make judgements about it ? How could they possibly construct a human phylogenetic tree if traits are modified by enviornment , not dictated by randomly mutating genes ? How can the pigs in science proclaim that Neandethals were a different `` species '' based not on their genes -- which are 99.9 % similar as ours -- but their receding chin and large skull ? Evolutionary science is full of nothing but good-for-nothing , monkey-loving , chance-worshipping , racist fools .
Of course , this is because marc himself does n't understand the alleged `` gaps . ''
An amount of violence miniscule in comparison to the violence caused by Christians intolerant of other religion ; look to the Crusades and the Inquisition if you please . Look at the justification for the slaughter of Native Americans . Look even today at the ruthless murders of gay people . But just as I would not judge all Christians by the actions of some , it is inappropriate to judge all evolutionists by the actions of some . Overall , I do n't think this author brought up any legitimate point against evolution except for the lack of transition species , which is an interesting topic in itself . However , if the author had proven that the world is young , the most logical explanation would be that evolution occurred in a shorter span of time , for all of our scientific evidence points toward evolution . If the author had proven that evolution had n't occurred , then the most logical explanation that some similar , natural process is the cause . But it is a great leap of faith to suggest that Creationism is correct . See , the author has made a mistake fatal in debate : he has attack his opponent 's viewpoint , then stated that since his opponent is wrong , he is correct . But that is not true , for he has not provided any reason for us to believe that he is correct . I , for example , might be contending that a bunch of Vampires carried stones together to form the Earth , then used their magic powers to make those stones into our world today . I could have then stated exactly all of the things this author stated , only replacing those Biblical quotes with writings about Vampires , and I could have come to the same conclusion . Since the evolution is wrong , then I am right . But that 's just not good enough . Even if he had proved evolution were wrong , there is no more reason to believe in the supernatural than there is to believe in Vampires , Dragons , Pixies , or any other mythological creation . This does n't mean that those things do n't exist , just that there is no reason to believe in them .
But the latter is exactly what some ( especially in the U.S. ) propose as science and truth .
Unless they successfully implement legislature based on religious dogma that breaches religious freedom of non-believers . Which is her stated goal .
And this is a bad thing ?
Which is why this statement is so interesting . What precisely do you mean by this Cush ? is science the way to read the and interpret the physical world around us and faith to look after the spiritual of ourselves ? Or should I say are science and faith completely separate from one another while being complementary to each other at the same time ?

To teach them to look at each side and decide for themselves is not paranoia . Blocking one side , not by the will of the people but by the courts , is actually paranoia .
What statements ? If you are referring to the 600 prophesies mentioned above ... consider that I could write down a prophesy today about something that will happen tomorrow . Then tomorrow , I could either act out that which I wrote down the previous day in order to fulfill the prophesy . OR I could just write down a description of me fulfilling that particular prophecy and pass it off as me actually fulfilling the prophesy . In this manner , the probability of me fulfilling the prophecy is 100 % . Because I made it happen .
Really ; Dembski ? Have you any good sites ? Are they 'published ' anywhere ( hint hint )
Nice spin by way of projection but you are wrong as usual . I find your defination of your position to be too funny . Like it is some how wrong to turn the tables on the left by using their methods . You still fail to address the fact of liberal firearm owners . Or is the fact of owning a firearm enough to have one drummed out of the liberal camp , buttons ripped off and sword broken ?
Well , those who keep using that story ca n't see the real sins of those cities . They are so sure that it was rampent homosexuality which lead to their destruction . Even though we know that before the Angels were ever sent God had spelled out why he was going to destroy them . He sent the angels because they promiced to find even one righteous man . They failed in that because the angels were attacked for being foreigners . Noone who abuses this story is ever going to admit this fact . They ca n't see past the supposed homosexual issue .
So your point is that there are a lot of stupid people out there ?
Anti-gunners . Why do you HATE our Constitutions Bill of Rights ? Why do you persecute people who can pass a background check not only once , but every time they purchase a new gun ? You told America that this would satisfy you , when this new law was proposed ! But NO ! You demonize us anyway ! We prove our lawfulness not only when we purchase a new gun , but also CCW people have to pass another background check when they apply for a Concealed Handgun License , then take a test and classes to boot ? We already have 22 to 30 thousand gun laws . When are you going to be reasonable ? So what 's the deal ? Why do you HATE America so much ? Why do you HATE us law-abiding people who keep our noses clean all of our lives ? Heck , I am 62 and have never run afoul of our laws . Do you think we are going to start now ? Descent and public discourse is fine , but I surely hope you folks are not planning violence against our Great and Unique Country ! You often sound like it is possible when you complain incessantly about our Constitution , our Rights and the laws of this nation governing the peaceful use and ownership of firearms .
The article as a whole never made that argument either . Lie number ... . oh I ca n't keep track anymore , let 's just call it 40 .
oh because for the past decade or so they have been indoctrinated into hating alleged liberal activities ( let 's ignore the fact that without liberalism there would be no USA ! ) Extreme enviromentalism is nuts . Extreme industry is nuts . To be sane and happy , there must be a middle ground .
Does personal autonomy = liberty ? If so , I thought that our FF 's decided it came from `` our Creator . ''
I believe that the theory you speak of is called slavery ; everybody is equal because they have nothing and need to work long and hard just to earn the privilege of living in order to serve their masters .
You mean like allowing for , and funding , comprehensive sex education , birth control , and parenthood planning ? Those things alone would reduce the number of abortions significantly . However , we live in a nation that would fire a Surgeon General for stating that masturbation is healthy . We live in a nation that believes that sex is only of the penis-vaginal penetration variety . We live in a nation where most pregnancy are unplanned . We 're so busy `` protecting ' our children , that we do n't realize that the best protection is information .
According to who ? Though it may not have been practiced to its fullness , it in no way follows that all men are not created equal .
It has a financial impact on ALL taxpayers . To say that it has no impact on anyone else is disengenuous .
So , if a baby is having trouble breathing that 's been born already , you do n't consider it a 'person ' ? Methinks you 've not thought through the implications of your argument here at all .
No , they do n't . Creationists do . `` Why have n't all animals turned into humans ? ''
I did not say that I agree with a tax incline , and perhaps that is a discussion for a different time . However there is a difference that I should point out . There is a reason for the tax incline : those with little money will suffer a lot more if they have to pay hijgher taxes . Those with high taxes are much more able to give money without losing those things essential to a decent standard of living . Is it equal ? Interestingly it could be viewed as an attempt to give everyone a more equal income , however it could also be viewed as an inequality involving one group of people paying lots of taxes and another group paying not as much . I wo n't debate whether it is the type of equality we want to promote , I 'll just assume that a tax incline removes equality . But remember , there is a reason behind that tax incline . The goal of government is to promote happiness as much as possible . In this case , the government could be viewed as sacrificing equality in favor of happiness . But whether that tradeoff is really working or is really a good idea is all up for debate . The point is : there is reasoning behind a tax incline based on income . There is no good reason behind giving marriage benefits to people based on their sex and there are plenty of reasons to do just the opposite . Or at least it is my goal to prove that in these posts .
Because those who are pro life are against a womens right to own her own body . Her body her choice and none of anyone elses business . Remember control freaks are everywhere .
Just curious , how legal is that ?
Why is this relevant ?
So your god is like a used car salesman ?
No ... and you do n't have to either .
Not wanting to appear insensitive , but XXX is she doing having a 4th child if she ca n't even support the first 3 ? I do n't buy a 4th car if I ca n't afford the upkeep , why should children be different ? It 's the entitlement mentality that caused our current problems with illegitimacy and keep the poor chronically poor . She does n't need an abortion , she needed birth control/sterilization prior to becoming pregnant .
So we do n't know if it is a fact ( from what you stated ) . Here 's why : A : evolution is a fact B : evolution crumbles easily If B , then A is false . B is false . Therefore , A may be true or false .
Oh please - and the prolife side does n't do this ? All the pics they distribute of aborted babies are n't the very rare late term ones ? It 's called propganda and generally both sides use it in most major debates .
So does requiring everyone to go through a security check before boarding a plane suggest that nobody is capable of being trusted ?
Yes , there are differences , but the claim is not that the other stories were identical , just that they preceded the time Jesus is claimed to have lived , and that elements of these various foreshadowing stories were very similar to those told about Jesus . Continuing for a second on the idea of the eucharist having been borrowed by Christians from earlier traditions :
First you yourself make a baseless comment saying `` the amount of illegal abortions was not that many '' then you suggest I need to disprove some baseless comment you previously made . I 'm afraid I do not . As I said I try to take a world view -- America is a small place compared to the entire world . My comments are never reffering to America specifically unless I specify otherwise ; I do n't even live in America so it grates slighlty that I should have to make this point .
Whether a fetus is a person is not something open to consideration . An apple is not an orange . The reason that we have two words to apply as labels is simply because they absolutely are not the same thing . It is that simple . Suppose that a fetus is frozen and implanted in a female 22 years later . Is it of legal drinking age at birth ? Obviously not . We currently have the technology to actually do this .
In Canada anyway , the father must be identified on the medical records ( to the best of the woman 's knowledge anyway ) . I have n't seen the medical records , I do n't know if Bush was indicated as the father or not , but to the best of my knowledge , they have always asked who the father was . The next step is to deny it was his child , Jerry Springer or Jenny Jones style , also typical . Apparently 4 of her friends were willing to sign an affadavit that he was , AT THE TIME OF THE ABORTION . Is that 100 % proof ? Of course not , but it 's pretty compelling evidence . Interesting that despite the fact you are pro-choice , and that you do n't really have any evidence to the contrary , you immediately pounced on this thread with an unwavering defense of Bush . Especially on an issue which you do n't consider as being of high importance in the campaign . Is it not even remotely possible that Bush is n't `` perfect '' ? Waxy
No , in other words `` the cut and thrust of peer review . '' Where ID falls flat on its face . Stop trying to dress that up as some kind of underserved mugging ; if you are n't prepared to understand and defend ID on a scientific level you are n't equipped to decide that it is being unfairly treated .
How is that conclusion derived at ? The passage is speaking to the consequences to a man who 's actions cause the death of an unborn child . And the proscribed consequence is death according to OT Law . So although the passage is n't speaking to abortion at all , it is making a very clear statement regarding the value of the unborn , as it is requiring a life for a life just as for any other sentient being according to the OT Law . So these arguments I get from the likes of you and Iangb which argue that until a child shows mental awareness , it is n't actually a person deserving of human rights is a bogus and shortsighted position according to the scriptural point of view . Of that , there is no question .
You mean the truth of thousands of young teen girls dead with a coat hanger in hand ? Abortion is a neccessity so that it can be regulated . People will have abortions legal or not legal . At least provide a safety net other than a coat hanger .
Yes , they do show a faithful devotion to the ultimate reality that there are no gods . You 're an atheist , are n't you ?
Of corse it was cold this year every year is different Globle warming is a yuppie fraud study . I do not beleve in Globle warming . If there was globle warming we would not have snow like we did 2 and 3 years ago . Every thing has been normal that I can tell . Gee I wonder how much money was wasted on this foolish study and brain washing .
Do you really think Obama gives a damn about the kind of economic destruction any sort of gun ban will have ? No ! He does n't care , and neither does the liberal controlled congress that wants guns banned ! They do n't care if a billion people die , all they want is all guns gone ! I 've seen the memo . Right now I want to tie a shovel to a tree branch .
So what ? They are n't worth anything , are they ? Does it matter if we kill them ? No , in your reasoning it does n't because there are no absolutes .
oh , sure ... ok ... whatever you say .
This is a statement written by someone who obviously has not read scripture . One of the most astonising `` proofs '' if you will , that the Bible is of supernatural origin , is predictive prophecy . Science can not , as you claim , `` explain '' everything , and it has no natural explanation for the predictions made in scripture . How can science explain through statistical probablity the over 600 prophecies in Biblical writings that have come to pass ? Also , how can it explain how supposedly uneducated people ( uneducated in the ways of modern science ) wrote about astronomy as if they knew about the universe as we do today . How could they have described the hydrological cycle as we have only come to know it recently ? Ecclesiastes 1:6 The wind goes toward the south , And turns around to the north ; The wind whirls about continually , And comes again on its circuit . How did they know that the earth `` hangs on nothing '' when the accepted norm of the day did not even accept that possibility ? Job 26:7 He stretches out the north over empty space ; He hangs the earth on nothing . How did they know that the `` vapors '' of the earth rise to create moisture , that is seeded by lightning with nitrogen and then falls as rain to fertilze the soil ? Jeremiah 10:13 When He utters His voice , There is a multitude of waters in the heavens : And He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth . He makes lightning for the rain , He brings the wind out of His treasuries. Hydrothermal vents [ 4 ] are described in two books of the Bible written before 1400BCmore than 3,000 years before their discovery by science . Genesis 7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noahs life , in the second month , the seventeenth day of the month , on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up , and the windows of heaven were opened . Even though the Bible is not a scientific text book and does n't purport to be , nowhere is it scientifically inaccurate . In addition , many of the scientific ideas you are so impressed with are nothing new to the Bible . It was speaking of these things long before modern science spoke of them . The story goes `` They ( scientists ) are slowly working their way to the mountain 's peak painstakingly measuring and analyzing every step that they take . After many years of research , they finally arrive at the top of the mountain , scale over its leading edge , only to find a group of theologians sitting there with the answers all along . ''
Like the crazy idea the Earth goes around the Sun .
Because all scientists hate god . Again , this is a fact .
And that is different how ? I told johnny to write that I 'm infallible . Therefore the book that I told johnny to write proves I 'm infallible . There is no difference .
I do n't give a damn about the circumstances of the unborn either ( obvious here I am not saying I do n't care what happens to either , but for the sake of whether or not we should kill the unborn this is my stance ) . Neither one should have a right to kill the other ... and for that matter , no one else should be allowed to come up and murder the women or the unborn . So my views are still treating them as equals . and I will ask you to stay away from more assumtions that you ca n't prove .
Evolutionists do not argue about light-years as it is not a part of evolution . I dont know how the theories that Einstein developed could be used to show that a light-year is variable . None of this has any effect on the vast amount of physical evidence that the earth is around 4.5 billion years old .
I know I do . My parents taught me and I taught my sons . One is an officer of the court and the other is an Army noncom with 3 college degrees . I learned from my parents .
No , it 's plenty relevant . See what I mean , the pro-abortion crowd is attempting to downplay the signifigance of one of their heroines ' philosophies . Especially when you consider that Sanger was in lock-step with Adolph Hitler 's philosophy regarding the `` master race ! ''
Well , being a gun owner myself , I agree with much that you 've posted . I do disagree somewhat with your conclusions in regard to these statistics however . For example , most of the states listed with high gun crime , and gun control laws , have cities that alone rival the population of the states with low gun crime , and less gun restrictions . And that may be part of the problem . Population density may well have some consideration here . It may be a lot easier , for example , for someone to commit multiple armed robberies in a given period of time in say someplace like NYC , than it would be in a rural state like Vermont or Montana . this in turn , would more naturally increase the chances of someone being shot , because of not giving up their wallet , or attempting to resist in saome other manner . Bear in mind , I 'm not saying that this is the case . I 'm saying that it may be a factor . With just the numbers you 've given us , I do n't think there 's necessarily proof of corellation between lack of crime and relative freedom from restrictive gun laws . The likely-hood is that it certainly helps , and in fact may be one of the major reasons . I just do n't think you can say it 's the only , or even the main reason .
Well the continual occurrence of shootings at schools that outlaw concealed carry , vs the lack of any shootings at schools that allow concealed carry , would suggest something along those lines .
Throw off our conclusions about what ? I 'm getting a bit confused as to what you 're trying to cast doubt upon . Dark matter is stuff that does n't interact via the electromagnetic force , so again by definition anything that we ca n't 'see ' using EM waves is dark matter . this is an interesting article about one way we can observe it indirectly
Too late , drug usage has already created those epidemics . Legalizing drugs may increase some of them temporarily , but they already exist . I would argue that there would be a decrease in crime , for certain .
If you wanted to be picky about it , I guess you could say that it was a form of last-ditch birth control , after the other forms failed .
So why is it in the debates your position is easily viewed as opposed to firearm rights ?
And thus the human condition is explained at last !
the later the better , it seems to me
Oh ? What keeps you from having 6 or eight or for that matter having crossed bandoleers across the chest ? I suspect kalifornia law will be changed a bunch and one in the pipe will be in vogue as well as a loaded mag in the gun for utility sake . You would n't want the perp to be disadvantaged too much now would you ? How many shots must one allow the perp before you can fire back ?
That is just conservative bias . Conservatives are just as guilty of the same things as liberals and then each has their own ideological idiocy that is unique to each group . Conservatives like classes and do n't like change . A pure conservative society would fail just as quickly as a pure liberal one . The last 10 - 20 years as we have become more us vs. them the overall prosperity and well being of the country has declined . With both sides taking the country to extremes . Conservatives eased restrictions and corporations run wild . Those laws are in place for a reason . Liberals overreact and put a choke hold on growth . There was a reason for less restrictive laws , but now they ca n't do anything meaningful .
Do the words `` govt . by the people and for the people '' not matter to you at all ? Furthermore , to say that the constitution should n't be allowed under the vote of the people itself in unconstitutional , since that 's the only way the Constitution CAN be amended . ( 2/3 of states ) A country that uses judges to determine such sweeping things as redefining marriage is a `` legistocracy '' , which we are quickly turning into as a nation . Even though judges are supposed to interpret the constitution , it 's still putting the fate of the people in the hands of individuals regarding their laws . This is not very far removed from monarchy . Personally , I think our founding fathers and the Constitutional framers are rolling over in their graves right now .
But not at the expense of people spreading lies about science and forcing religious untruths into science classes .
For once I agree with you . Your wrong on your thoughts and views with evolution but your right in saying that abortion is wrong .
So what you are saying is simply that the genes do not actively control the body . What is wrong with assuming that genes therefore do not control the body is the fact that the genes were the blueprint for the body . The genes decided the arrangement of cells , the number of fingers , etc . The body , the cells , and the organelles within the cells are therefore strongly influenced by the DNA sequence .
That was the whole point of asking the questions , to prove evolution is n't an absolute truth .
Is it correct to assume that in the presence of the precursors of the standard genetic code ( e.g . intermediates of glucose degradation and the citric acid cycle ) , the intimate relationship between these molecules resulted in the inevitable organization of the genetic code ( global optimum of the system ) ? Articles 5-7 These articles discuss fascinating mathematical representation of the genetic code . For example , in article 6 a representation of the genetic code as a sixdimensional Boolean hypercube is proposed . Abstract :
I believe Alan Keyes already have used that term on us . ( Alan Keyes , the ultra-concervative Republican Candidate for the Illinois Senate seat - in opposition to Barack Obama . The Maryland resident the Republican party had to recruit because they could n't find anyone else in their right mind who would go against Barack . Also the very same Maryland resident/Television talkshow host who beratted Hilary Clinton for moving to NY and expecting to be able to `` represent '' NY'ers . Yeah , look who 's the hypocrit now . )
Well try Arkansas ( 75/25 ) , Georgia ( 76/24 ) , Kentucky ( 75/25 ) , Michigan ( 59/41 ) , Mississippi ( 86/14 ) , Montana ( 67/33 ) , North Dakota ( 73/27 ) , Ohio ( 62/38 ) , Oklahoma ( 76/24 ) , Oregon ( 57/43 ) , and Utah ( 66/34 ) . All of these margins were well above the percentage of votes cast for Bush and Kerry , respectively . Ohio , for instance , went to Bush by 2 % , but the ban was passed by 24 % . Bush lost Oregon by 4 % , but the ban passed by 14 % . Bush lost Michigan by 3 % , but the ban passed by 18 % . The margin of victory for each of these states exceeds George Bush 's margin of victory in that state . Those extra votes had to come from somewhere , and it seems like many people other than the `` religious right '' feel the same way .
Oh God no . If there is anything more boring than twits talking , its twits
But only if they 're willing to receive one . Most are n't .
Well , who knows ? I hope at that point our society will be more accepting of diversity . Women are certainly more accepting of homosexuality . I think women would not want their uterus and fetus tampered with , to be made straight , just because it would be shown to have a gene which could make it gay . There are many deaf people who would not become hearing if that could be cured , and who do not even learn to speak , because they see themselves as `` differently abled '' . It is who they are , and they appreciate their culture .

So the fact that there are fewer crimes in britain is evidence , but the fact that there is a great deal more crime in S Africa , despite having some of the strictest gun control laws in the world , is not ? In new york , the reduction in crime was the result of an overhaul of police and the criminal justice system . Couple pages on that : http : //www.city-journal.org/html/15_1_ny_crime.html http : //www.ny.gov/governor/patrecord/crime.html New York started instituting prohibitive firearms laws in the 60s . Most of the firearms laws they `` enjoy '' now were put in place in the 70s ( except for a brief round of idiocy in the 90 's having to do with semi-auto rifles ... . '' assault weapons '' , which they banned despite the fact that the police commissioner of NY City testified that they had no record of one ever being used in a crime ) . So , they had prohibitive gun control for 30+ years , and then when they spent billions on theri criminal justice system and police , none of which had anything to do with gun control , their crime rate started to fall , and somehow you want us to believe that this was due to the gun control ? Nobody here is that gullible .
Yea , that too , obviously . I did n't include that because obviously you would assume that .
Amen ! ! Punish the whore ! If she would have just had the kid she would discover what we all know ... That the child would have been loved and protected given a nurturing home by her because she is n't really smart enough to know what she wants . She MUST have the kid , when it arrives all will be well ! ! We just know it !
so watching TV sports = bad daddy ? do you let your boyfriend/girlfriend or husband watch TV sports or only feminist approved TV channels ?
Apparently pretty narrow interpretation , and not one of the `` priviledges and immunities '' of citizens . Handguns for the purposes of lawful self-defense in the home . That appears to be what the Second Amendment now protects .
The gene and therefore the enzyme it produces . LPL is the designation for a gene that encodes Lipoprotein Lipase , an enzyme that hydrolyzes lipids in lipoproteins . The actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide . One study was able to identify 3 common SNPs ( Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ) in the coding region of the gene , 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in European populations . The third SNP converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long . Thus , the enzyme has been truncated . The resulting enzyme , LPL S447X , is functional . In fact , it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure . Other truncations result in non-functional enzymes .
Just like the first amendment starts with `` Congress shall make no law '' , which is no less absolute . OR the fourth , `` The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated '' . Do I need to go on ? Every one of the original ten amendments , witht he exception of the 6th and 7th contain strong language that leave no doubts as to the fact that the rights are protected . Yet we DO have laws regarding free speach , the DMCA , etc ...
corrected above , thank you , minus the insult that followed . It still stands however as a rational rebuttal .
Plague ships were n't protected under the Second Amendment during colonial days . This was the closest thing there was to a WMD , Americans could 've used them do devastate Britain and kill everyone . So why was n't the possession of plague infested ships protected ?
And who is keeping these drug cartels in business ? Could it have anything to do with America 's `` insatiable demand for illegal drugs '' as admitted by the US Secretary of State ? `` Mrs Clinton said : 'Our insatiable demand for illegal drugs fuels the drug trade. `` 'Our inability to prevent weapons from being illegally smuggled across the border to arm these criminals causes the deaths of police officers , soldiers and civilians. `` 'I feel very strongly we have a co-responsibility . ' `` She also acknowledged that US efforts to ban drugs had so far been unsuccessful in stopping the narcotics trade. `` 'Clearly , what we have been doing has not worked and it is unfair for our incapacity ... to be creating a situation where people are holding the Mexican government and people responsible , ' she said .

Prove that it is untrustworthy ... It is an organization of professionals and is as trustworthy as any other Professional organization .
So , then you DO feel that what you did was a sin . Otherwise you would n't have asked forgiveness for it . I have one question . What was your motivation for starting this thread ? Was it to try and somehow prove that a person can be a Christian and have an abortion ? Just curious . IMO , you are right that you are forgiven for it , as God is a forgiving and loving God . But I hope you do n't do it again .
so you are all for ignoring all the people killed by cars , cigarettes , knives , AIDS , heavy objects , falling accidents , construction accidents , pneumonia , fires , and heart diesease . Heart diesease is the number 1 killer in the US , so why arent you pushing for people to eat better , to exercise more , and stop being so fat ? so ill ask again why guns ?
Columbus could become very attractive to armed criminals .
So the creationists behind it are lying when they say that 's exactly what it is ?
Why then wo n't you state your ultimate agenda ... `` reasonable gun control '' is not an agenda if you can not back that statment up . A view that inteferes wih my constitutional right is an attempt by the lunatic fringe to intefere with my life ... Simple .
Actually , there is no such implication . However , there are some things that we might expect if all life is descended from a common ancestor . For one thing , we might expect that the molecule of heredity would be the same across all life . We find that it is DNA . We would expect that the particular codons that encode amino acids would be quite similar for all forms of life . That turns out to be the case , except for minor variations in some primitive forms of life , the DNA code is identical across life . We would expect to see a nested hierarchy of species and we do . We find that house cats are similar to the other 36 species of cat , which are carnivores , which are mammals , which are tetrapods , which are vertebrates , which are chordates . We would expect to find transitional species between major groups of animals , and we do . We find feathered dinosaurs and birds with bony tails and teeth . We find whales with feet . We find reptiles that are very much like mammals , even some with a double jointed jaw that was part of the transition of reptile jaw bones to the inner ear of mammals . We even find mammals that lay eggs .
Well then . All of the ex-christians have it both ways do n't they . Since they are saved they can lie , cheat , steal and have wild , illicit sex ( following the example of several christian preachers ) .
Well , if that is your perspective , yes , I can see why you would think they are the same idea . However , the differences between the two theories are much , much more fundamental than just the wording . Perhaps the most obvious difference is that creationism is a committed structure of theological beliefs , while ID is based entirely on scientific evidence . Although it is true that ID has theological implications , the same could be said of evolution , the big bang , and , for that matter , any theory regarding the origin of biology and the universe . Creationism , on the other hand , is an entirely theological idea that attempts to find support in the realm of science . Because it is theologically based , each of the following beliefs are necessarily a part of being a traditional creationist : 1 . Apes and humans did not share a common ancestor . 2 . The earth is about six thousand years old . 3 . Life on earth did not have a common ancestor . 4 . Changes within existing life occur only within fixed limits . 5 . Belief in catastrophism , usually involving a global flood as the primary explanation . 6 . There was a sudden creation of the universe , life , and energy from nothing . None of the above beliefs are part of ID theory . Because ID is derived and proven using scientific evidence , it is a much more unassuming theory . ID proposes the following : 1 . Irreducible and specified complexity are reliable indicators of design . 2 . Systems in biology exhibit irreducible and specified complexity . 3 . Natural and/or undirected explanations are inadequate when it comes to irreducible and specified complexity . 4 . As a result of the above three points , Intelligent Design is the best explanation for the origin of these kinds of complexity in biological systems .
Finally an inkling of intelligence .
Would the lack of a concealed carry permit have stopped these people from illegally concealing a weapon and then going out and killing regardless ?
Because we give straight answers , yet never recieve them .
That was the past . I 'm speaking of now .
Are you denying that the African Eve model was not born on a computer ? ? You do n't know your own theory very well . Look it up yourself . Any well-informed evolutionist should know this .
Actually it would n't . Since there is no rational , believable evidence for creationism , it would n't be any more believable if evolution were disproved . As an example , I dare you to start a thread in an appropriate forum and give us tested evidence for a global flood as depicted in Genesis . Good luck .
Because violent crime and violent criminals is something that I ca n't control . Heart disease , that can be worked on with good diet , exercise and medicine if necessary . It 's manageable , controllable and can be avoided . You ca n't do that with a violent criminal .
Here is the first LIE and rewriting of history by a proponent of gay marriage . If anyone actually studies the civil rights movement they will plainly see that it was the southern democrats who plunged us first into the civil war under Lincoln 's administration by attempting succession rather than freeing the slaves , and it was the DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS who fought civil rights legislation right up to the 60s before finally passing a weaker bill than was submitted by a Republican at the time . Al Gore Senior was one of the loudest opposers of civil rights . And was George Wallace and Governor Patterson , Governors who refused to honor or enforce equal rights after passage , Republicans or a Democrats ? For you children from Rio Linda , they were Democrats . They fought desegregation at every level of the process .
Well , HRC estimates that the costs would be negligable and that some governments would actually save money . They site many studies on the issue , which I have not taken the time to look up , as I think this sort of statistic is worthless . It is unreasonable to ask same-sex couples to pay for the marriage of opposite-sex couples without asking opposite-sex couples to return this payment . Still , you seem very concerned about it , so I will provide this link : http : //www.hrc.org/Template.cfm ? Sect ... entDisplay.cfm It is an interest group in favor of gay rights , yes , but that does n't make them wrong . I did have a link to an actual study on the topic , but I can not seem to find it . I 'm sure if I scoured the Internet more , I could come up with something .
Why are you against abortion ?
And ... You 're still left with the simple fact that the Declaration of Independance , the premise of your hierarchy of rhetoric , is not legally relevant to the government of the U.S . The constitution was written after the declaration . Had they wanted to include wording from the declaration , they could have , yet they did n't , did they ? Your house of cards is built on a rhetorical slight of hand , trying to persuade by implying somehow that abortion being legal , which it is , in the U.S. , right now , should not be allowed . TIP : Trying forming a reasoned argument without such a weak premise , else , your entire argument is just as flawed , which it is . Abortion is legal , for the right reasons . A conscious , human , U.S. citizen , has rights . Cells , without consciousnes , that are not citizens , do not have rights , are not individuals , and are not humans . You can jump up and down , and post irrelevant things such as the Dec. of Independance , but it does n't boost your debate credibility . -Mach
Well , that 's generally true of any process that uses energy . Some is wasted .
Look over the Heller ruling again . All nine judges agreed unanimously that the Second Amendment protected a right that was wholly individual in nature . The only disagreement was whether the right still applied today . And no , the individual states and cities should n't be allowed to set their own standards for a constitutional right , that flies in the face of the 14th Amendment . And worse , you 're arguing for precedent that would basically allow the various states to not respect your other rights ; they could ban the shirt you choose to wear because it 's offensive to some small , insignificant minority somewhere .
You are probably using the NIV version of the Bible . It is not the most accurate version because some of the meaning was lost in the translation . Here is the NASB version ( much closer to the original meaning ) : 1 Chronicles 16:30 `` Tremble before Him , all the earth ; Indeed , the world is firmly established , it will not be moved . '' `` will '' = future tense . The earth itself is moving ( rotating , orbiting the sun , etc . ) , but it `` will not be moved '' by something else .
Well , actually , I did find it funny even though I 'm a male ( or at least , I think I am ? ) ... probably because it 's a joke and I know I 'm not like the stereo-typical male so I can laugh at them . PS , I 'm so unique because I 'm so humble and would never brag about my bulging muscles , manhood and amazing intellect .
Edmund , you still have n't come out of that wardrobe .
What school child has n't seen the sequential 5 or 6 pictures of a chimp , or ape , gradually turning into a man ? How about all the scientific claims that man and chimps share a common ancestor ? Abiogenesis strongly implies that there is no God , as does most of the dreams and theories of what has , and is , going on in outer space . If ID is not science , then none of the above is science , yet it is in today 's science classes .
Chastity rather than promiscuity .
False , since Copernicus had already propsed same , it was really because Gallieo was a jerk with the Pope and Church authorities . No one else was treated like him . He was a `` special '' case . - Click Here
Actually , it 's not a good point . I usually question the maturity of people who judge other people by where they were born and raised . There are good things about every state . Louisianna is just as good as any other state . So are most of the people who live there . There are crooks in every state , also .
So you 're actually claiming that it is a lie to say that the UK has a lower gun crime rate than the US ? Even if the police were miscounting crimes it 's still a huge and unjustified leap in logic to conclude from that that the UK does not have a lower gun crime rate .
As it stands in the uk a father has no sat whatsoever in the welfare of the baby/fetus if his partener wants to terminate he need never even be told . I am with you on the life or death of the mother senario although it is my beleif that as a mother it is my job to give my life in exchange of that of my child/baby/fetus .
So what ? I do n't care ! Gun ownership is an individual right and that 's the end of it ! You do n't have to exercise a right hundreds of thousands of times a year for it to be protected by the Constitution .
Could be phrased in a more polite way . Probably the whole name of this forum should be changed from creation versus evolution to creationism versus alternatives . Because every creationist I have seen on this board has used the creationist definition of evolution which non-creationists flatly reject and it wastes time . The replys to this very thread show that many people know the correct defintion of biological evolution and do not tolerate any other definition . If someone says the big bang people have to say the big bang and not the `` evolution of the universe '' because it will just waste time .
So you 're saying that God is a `` respector '' ? -of-persons - iow , the mom 's `` more '' -important to *God* ? than the unborn .
Well , it does take some scientific knowledge to understand the evidence for evolution . One does n't expect Creationists to possess it .
I see I jumped the gun . That was well stated .
No , there is n't a consensus among Christians , at least not beyond the fact that God was responsible in one way or another for the universe existing . There is no consensus about method .
Oh what a corageous maverick you are .
And without a gun you 're defenseless , why ca n't you seem to understand that ?
Muslims .
All of these examples are scientifically recognized as human life with a unique genetic code .
I do n't have any belief in this area . I do n't know how life started and accept that I probably never will know . It might have started through a God `` magicking '' the first cell into existence , it may have started through purely random natural processes or anywhere in between the two . One only has belief and faith in this regard when one claims to know how life started . `` I do n't know '' is not belief .
Yes . I would . [ As long as I can exercise 'critical thinking ' , along the way w/out personal attacks . ]
Actually , there is . The naturalistic explanation is the only viable theory put forth . Out of all the other crackpot theories ( they really are n't theories ) , this as well as later evolution are the only parsimonious ones . You use occam 's razor to select the most parsimonious theory out of competing theories . You look at them and see which ones attempt to explain the same phenomenon , and then look to see how they do it . WHich ones assume something outside of nature ? Paranomal ? GOD ! Not the naturalistic common ancestor/primoridal soup . THat 's fully plausible , and natural . And natural selection is n't nebulous . Your ignornance of the subject obfuscates that judgement . It 's been observed and there is more than adequate evidence for the vast majority of scientists .
And some of those tests fail . There are holes in the theory of gravity . Yet gravity remains fact in simple every day terms . Evolution is fact because `` we can observe it 's effects on objects and we can do tests to determine more about it '' . Further there are very few holes in that theory . Evolution is therefore more deserving of being called fact than gravity is . What I think you are really trying to say is that you can think you understand gravity ( drop ball ; ball falls ) therefore you see it as a fact . But evolution is complex even at a basic level , so you do not see it as fact .
Oh , what the hell . As is so often the case , I have a definitive source on this : http : //www.lunaseas.net/gaps/episode9.html
This is a very interesting post . You show a lot of knowledge and insight . It is quite long and I do n't think I understood all of it . Could you mention what is the most important point ? You make a good point that `` evolution is merely an illusion . '' I am thinking about this and I want to ask you what you see as the ramifications from this . Looking forward to seeing more of your posts .
Which is what they did to the Jews .
Oh what a shame ! Especially if it 's true ! Where did you get the idea that ID theory is not based on evidence and/or testing ?
According to what ? Are you saying you should be able to kill a baby 2 inches from being born if you wanted ? It is n't born yet .
You know , I think that you are rather an evil person , trying to create guilt where no guilt exists , where no guilt is necessary . Someone made a very important decision at a critical point in her life which made her life better and averted the consequences of a stupid mistake made by a youth . It was not an easy decision for her to make but she made it and it 's well in the past , except for the people who want her to feel guilt and trauma about it . Why do n't you try to make George Walker Bush feel a little guilt and trauma for destroying the nation of Iraq , for murdering tens of thousands of innocent women and children , for causing the deaths of nearly 3,000 young Americans who left behind mourning mothers , fathers , wives , husbands , in some cases many children who will be left to the mercy of our nation 's horrible economy and will probably live in poverty for the rest of their lives . But , I guess that when one worships the Almighty Fetus , the lives of real people are of no concern .
So far , you 've been nothing but wrong .
Nobody but you has suggested that the schools are out any money except for you , and you have presented no evidence whatsoever that they are . You ignore the LIKELY scenarios and immediately jump to an extremely UNLIKELY one that fits your agenda ... that they used school facilities without paying for them . Our local school district rents out school buses to groups and rents building facilities out for events all the time . It is smart ... .they have the resources on hand and it provides a little extra money for the district . Granted that explanation does not fit your agenda , and it would be much easier for you to make your point if we all ignored the most LIKELY solution and instead accepted your EXTREMELY UNLIKELY solution at face value , but you cant actually expect people with any intelligence at all to do that . As far as the cops go ... .have you ever seen a protest where there were NOT cops on hand ? I certainly never have . Even when Fred Phelps and his little band of sickos protests a funeral , the police are there to make sure that nobody starts handing out beat downs . One of the beautiful things about America is that you have the right to protest , and the police have a responsibility to protect you while you do it . The idea that the DC police would not have protected the BOA executive is another completely unsupported assumption put forth here and to some degree by the author of the article and frankly it is a particularly ignorant one . The author of the article contends that if the protesters had decided to burn the guys house there is nothing the DC police could have done to stop it since they were outside their jurisdiction AFTER they talk about the fact that there is a cross jurisdictional agreement in place . Frankly you would have to have the intelligence of a house plant to follow that line of reasoning . Your take on this entire thing is ridiculous and unamerican . There is no evidence whatsoever that anything improper took place here . What happened is that a bunch of protesters who were careful not to break the law went and told a guy that he is a huge XXXXX . The DC PD sent 2 units to ensure that nobody was hurt during the course of the protest . The local police also sent units in response to calls from neighbors . The local police stayed until the end , but no arrests were made because , as they noted in their statement , the protesters were careful not to break any laws . I believe that you , sir , are little more than a partisan hack bending reality to fit your agenda .
Oh really ? < snicker > Then why do n't you : 1 ) explain exactly how my second statement is wrong and 2 ) how the rest of your post was not an attempt to explain how you wrongly believed my statement to be wrong Here is your entire post :
How about rationality ? It is not the same as intelligence ( which is more like 'mental capability ' or 'ability to learn ' as opposed to specific process of identification ( the axiom of consciousness ) .
I wish you guys would quit trying to `` muddy the waters '' by introducing facts that contradict my claims , innuendo , cliches and WAG . - signed X gazer
well then back up your claim . Saying Im sure that  doesnt make it true .
HeavenBound -- I would like to point out that Pandion clarified that you seem to oppose science . Because of the nature of your questions and how they are phrased , I think it is a reasonable assumption to make . However , I will come right out and ask you : HeavenBound -- What is your opinion with regard to the evolution / creationism debate ? Peace , The Bootfitter
And you have just described `` creation science . '' No application of the scientific method . No testing . The conclusions are known before the judicious quoting of scientific authority has even begun . I notice that you use one of those quotes of a scientific authority below . You show that you are what you decry .
Well , you just do n't understand . Now , instead of one long stretch of missing links , we now have two shorter missing links , one on each end .
Sounds like the same skeptic argument above . I do n't know about you Nu Leader , but when I 'm certain my mind exists . Are you not certain ? You are actually required to be , to deny you exist would require existence , and that would be logically contradictory .
Gun owners had to take a school district to court to stop the anti gun/gun control advocates from preaching the anti gun side of the gun issue .
`` d00d '' ( do you really think I do not know how to spell d00d ? ) I am one of these so called paranoid people ... But it is not paranoia it is vigilance . I do n't expect any ill to come my way but if it does ... well lets say I am `` well-regulated '' ... Should you thank your government overlords to allow you to protect your family with a shotgun as opposed to a FLASH SUPPRESSED carbine ? Ever fire a shotgun or rifle not flash suppressed at night ? lets just say pray there is only one of them and he got the lead or you 'll be running around like mr-magoo while he rapes your wife and steals your government cheese . OH and not so good for the Koreans ... Those very same AK 's which saved those individuals AND the state millions of dollars ca n't own those weapons anymore ... hmmmm ... .. Oh and its not the russians.. Its the jack booted blue helmets that will come knockin when some skirt wearing liberal turns over our soveriegnty to the UN . Do n't laugh Klinton tried it . Standing up screaming the cold dead hands mantra is not extremism . Its called defending the constitution . Personally I usually wear a MOLON LABE ! tshirt ( Avaliable here when I attend council meetings , at the airport , various functions were the libs tend to hang out ... Its a declaration of freedom ... Not paranoia ... . vigilance not rebellion . Get educated.. read Unintended Consequences then reflect on your position . You will see that `` reasonable '' gun control is not so `` reasonable '' . BTW you half passed the test.. Personally I would never under ANY circumstance list the weapons or most other property for that matter . Why would you alternate hydrashocks with UMC ? besides the supersonic 135gr hydrashock is a much better man-stopper ...
Please go to http : //www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/ and do research . You will find some hard to understand articles and some easy ones . All of them , however , are very informative .
There is no god that supports the forcing of women to suffer and carry out unplanned pregnancies , just because some PL advocate spits it our . `` Sorry , were going to force you to give birth , those men over there have decided '' . Thats as ridiculous as saying `` There is no god to condones the slaughter of thousands of innocent life forms inside of the cut '' ( referring to disinfecting a cut ) . Pro-lifers have been dropped on their head too many times .
Ok . I 'm not a YEC . So , God creation through science is a viable option for my faith .
And you do n't actually see the circulariey in your position ? The Bible is inspired by god because the Bible says that it is inspired by god . What if I wrote a book in which I declared that the book was inspired by god ? Good for you ? I 'll do it if you give me the word . And what about the Book of Mormon ? Takes your book and goes one better . Also inspired by god because it says that it is inspired by god .
I think you 've made a bit of a sweeping generalization here . I have n't heard of many people opposing sex altogether . I have heard of people who oppose both sex before marriage and sex outside of marriage .
It 's one thing that stands between us and a mindless theocracy . It protects the freedom of women from would-be ayatollahs who would make them sexual slaves .
You know , I 'd believe that more if there were people like the Shindler family who have pushed for federal courts to intervene and destroy the sanctity of marriage . There is nothing you could do or say that would convince me that Americans somehow have any respect for marriage whatsoever . What heterosexuals have done to destroy this institution from the inside out only tells me that heteros are simply spoiled children who have the attitude of : `` If we ca n't make it work , we are n't going to allow anyone else to come in and do marriage better . ''
Well let me put it like this , I consider it your duty because if you do n't protect yourself then you basically shift that responsibility to someone else . Not only is this incredibly selfish , but 9 out of 10 times the 'protection business ' gets outsourced to the State . This in itself it dangerous because when people decide that a third party like the State ( which has no real accountability ) has control over their lives it can all to easily lead to a situation where the State becomes tyrannical . More people have been killed by their own government than by any foreign government .
So ? God also says he made you out of dirt and then supernaturally lifting the dirt from the ground into the womans uterus . Oh well , I suppose it is all beliefs no matter how silly it sounds .
Appears that brady murdered the facts , tried to tamper with the evidence and then ran away . Such courage and what a demonstration of the dishonesty in his 'convictions ' .
So you put words in Machs mouth . This would be acceptable if you were not doing it in a malicious fashion to get some sort of sadistic pleasure but you were instead actually trying to get him to explain himself . At any rate it totally disproves your nonsense about how you above me because you do not put words into peoples mouths because you do the same . You were not being dishonest to start with I admit it would be wrong to deliberately misrepesent you but neither of the circumstances apply here .
Wrong , that they have the choice . What they do with that choice is their own business . To give them back their reproductive rights .
Really ? A lot of people say that every answer makes more questions . In some ways we seem to know less now than we did at the time of Newton , in that we are less certain . And Newton 's laws deal with what happens in a vacuum with no resistance , not direct human experience At any rate , my point is that you ca n't see all the evidence as piling up support for 'science ' as 'science ' is moulded to fit that evidence . Not a criticism of science , btw .
Get back to us on that .
well ... you got ta point there .
I think the reason for the law would be that there 's no reeason to have the ban in the first place ( ok , no GOOD reason ) .
Wo n't work . `` danger to the mother 's life '' has to cover allowing an abortion if there is a significant risk of psychological damage which might lead to suicide . Any doctor , especially in a country like yours with a runaway litigation culture , faced with `` I will kill myself and the baby if you do n't abort '' will decide there is a significant risk ( to his wallet mainly ) . It is for this reason that `` convenience abortions '' are technically illegal here in the UK , but they occur anyway .
What a good mum you must be .
Some mathematical definitions can be precise , but then others can be unprecise , because of one little thing a person like you would never be able to understand , and that is , humans are not perfect .
Or that they are dead , say from a genetic disease .
The comic relief does n't even recognize it has passed in on , or attempted to !
Actually , that honour is reserved for the usual representations of those who advocate young earth creationism .
And when supersport says that the fossil record was created by god to test the faith of the people ? He could make his hypothesis unfalsifiable , and he would n't care that it would be unscientific .
I 'm willing to teach you if you are willing to learn .
See Begging the Question
By all means , do n't try to redefine marriage and the problem is solved .
Stuff I picked up in Uni , along with the Human genetic code being 40 % identical to a banana ... so no specific reference , sorry .
You might want to get some help with that . The only people I have ever heard imply such things is feminists . That is really not right . It is time for you folks to understand that if a woman is raped , it is NOT her fault , it is the rapists fault . I do n't undestand how you folks can claim to be pro woman , then spread this draconian mindset .
As pointed out , with a different physics , chemistry and biology , the universe as we know it would n't exist . What is really damaging to the concept of creationism as truth is a list of what we should expect if a flood had occurred under the same laws of science that are in operation today . One problem with creationism ( I know , you want to ignore the problems ) is that they constantly fall back on miracle in order to do a reset of reality in order to circumvent reality when creationism bumps into scientifically impossible events . I do n't mean to rain on the parade , but with all that said , it has been done . There is a list of 28 items , originally compiled by Jim Moore , that we should find if the flood happened as per the Bible . Not even miracles can solve these . That list is followed by further problems that have been compiled by Ken Harding from numerous sources . What Would We Expect to Find if the World Had Flooded For more information you can refer to the Flood Geology FAQs at TO . Two items with information that specifically addresses the question of the OP are Problems with a Global Flood , and The Geologic Column and its Implications for the Flood .
You repeat that like it actually means something ! Could it that your side is paranoid looking for some vast Right Winged conspiracy ? Maybe it 's Bush 's fault !
Stop trying to muddy the waters . I was talking about developed nations with lower murder rates . You suddenly bring Chicago into the debate- a city with open borders in a nation where guns are freely available . Even if gun control has n't worked there it does n't follow that gun laws ca n't work on a national level .
So you agree that it 's not necessary to have high capacity magazines because gun owners can reload quickly when defending themselves against a criminals . Good we can agree on at least one thing .
Let me see if I have this right , Priscilla . You admit your ignorance of the topic and you refuse to read the linked article in order to learn the topic of the thread , and yet you are willing to offer an opinion . As Mr. Jack said , interesting .
What does that have to do with anything ?
as in anyone can purchase a fire arm without a background check or gun safety training ? not a good option . my apology if that was a failed sarcasm . -a|ex
You know what is absolutely incredible about you little child ? You constantly make the most blatantly ignorant and irrational statements which have no basis at all in reality , yet you actually think you are being intelligent . ( Note childs quote in my siggy , below . ) And you really should look up definitions before using words when you have no idea what they mean . Did n't you start a thread about that , hypocrite ? You are talking to a person who accepts Intelligent Design as a rational explanation for Mans origin , yet you are so ill informed that you allege he is aligned with a belief in animism , when animism was founded in pagan religions and asserts that pretty much everything has a soul and spirit . Animism ( from Latin anima ( soul , life ) [ 1 ] [ 2 ] ) commonly refers to a religious belief that souls or spirits exist in animals , plants and other entities , in addition to humans . [ 3 ] Animism may also attribute souls to natural phenomena , geographic features , and even manufactured objects . Religions which emphasize animism in this sense include Shinto , Hinduism and pagan faiths such as folk religions and Neopaganism.Animism - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia Now show me a christian who defends ID , believes that , you mental midget .
We know that now , but not because the sun rises every day , because we have identified other evidence that proves heliocentrism . The hypothesis `` the sun orbits the earth '' predicts it will rise and set every day , the hypothesis `` The earth is rotating '' predicts the same .
There are certainly other theories , but the big bang is the only one supported by the evidence .
And compare that to an equivalent sized human - if you compared the skill to a 10-13 year old boy , the erectus skeleton 's cranial capacity would be significantly smaller . Does n't contradict in the slightest other than the bizarre positions you decide other people should hold .
Yes , that is the point !
So once again youre steering away from the debate ? I do n't understand why your ignoring the debate and going off in a whole new direction even after making this same mistake in your last post . You 're still showing that the Bible has a flaw in it and therefore your making up your own story about what happened . You 're also making predictions about the future based on your own interpretation . I 'm sure you wo n't even considered that your wrong about either of these things though I doubt you have any reason to believe in either of them other than you have the idea stuck in your head now . [ quote ] The above fully answers the apparent contradiction you and others find in these passages . The reason you may think I may be presenting information contrary to normative Christian teaching is that you have picked a peculiarly thorny passage - something that skeptics of the Bible and enemies of God will almost always do . [ \QUOTE ] It only answers the contradiction after you fill in the blanks with your own interpretation and of course your interpretation is based on your personal views and no facts . All the facts that you can work with are in the Bible and as of this moment the Bible seems to have a flaw in it . Your trying to cover this flaw with a story that you made up . I guess in your mind this makes sense but I do n't think many Christians would even agree with you much less those of us who look for logic .
732,000 DID N'T sign the petition . It seems only 5 % of South Dakotans say `` repeal the extreme abortion ban '' and that is ASSUMING that all the signatures are valid . The good news for South Dakota is that come November they can show America how they really feel about abortion as opposed to having the courts decide laws .
Please explain this statement .
If private firearms were to be made illegal across the board , I suggest to you the civil unrest you speak of would be epidemic in our nation . The US , as it has stood constitutionally for 215 years , though wobbly at times , would cease to have existed , as envisioned by the founders of our country , and having been sacrificed for by so many brave men and women . That is my opinion , and of course , may not be shared by many .
Please , I beg you , stop trying to jam the world into your `` creation '' account through reason . You just wo n't get anywhere through reason , if your first choice is to believe the bible ( any religious works ) as truth , and go from there . What you just said is `` [ adaptation ] would be mutation by natural selection , not evolution '' First , the adaptation refers to the adaptation of the species . A population of wingless beetles survives . The missing wings is the mutation , and is n't caused by anything other than a mutation , it 's not a result of their being winds , or there being a god , it 's just a mutation in the gene code . The gene for the wings can dissappear into the endless gulf of other discarded mutations since those organisms that carry it will most likely die off before reproductive age . It can also be left in the DNA sequence , unused , and not active , unless some other mutation activates it . ( A large percentage of our DNA seems to be unused garbage code ) . When this happens , your species evolved . What is your point , that beetles can evolve ? Yes , they do . All life on earth seems to . Yet you do n't think it 's due to evolution ? Mind-boggling . Who is telling you evolution is `` bad '' or `` wrong '' ? Only if you arrive at that conclusion WITHOUT religion , can you even begin to have a discussion on it . Evolution in life only requires : DNA replication Mutations A natural environment ( that is , what we see here on earth , a complex system ) time Which of these do you feel is `` incorrect '' ? We can prove any of these , why persist ? -Mach
So what ? How long did the idea of magical creation out of nothing in 6 days hold prevelance before somebody actually challenged it scientifically ?
And I was correcting you . If you are offended then that 's the breaks .
You mean to tell me that you would deny a woman 's right to her own body for a zygote , yet you have no problem murdering real human beings ? Sounds like a conservative to me ...
Traitor ? More like the boy wised up on the matter . So , Brady , how 's it feel to have all your work and hopes destroyed in the blink of an eye ? How does it feel to know that your last best hope for a disarmed society has abandoned you by the side of the road , and you 're now out of options and the only thing left to do is eat the crow ?
Actually , they do . For example , a single gene in the peppered moth mutated to cause the dark morph . Similar mutations have been observed in other species of moth . We know of many , many mutations in all organisms .
Actually , nothing did not explode , a singularity expanded
And yet , many animals survive by instinct only , having been abandoned by their mother at birth . Would n't you think that with that capacity to survive without guidance that they would also have the capacity to learn new things from one generation to another as humans do , resulting in true intellectual evolution over the past 100 million years or so ?
If one ca n't attempt to falsify a theory then it is not open to science and therfore useless to science . It becomes simply an untestable belief .
Same thing happened in Rwanda . First they put the names of all Tutsis on lists . Then , the Hutu came around with machettes and took them off of the lists ... .permanently .
Well , I guess you 're entitled to your opinions . On the gun-control board , I imagine you might encounter a lot of rednecks- not the best specimen of our poplulation .
oh , now we 're getting somewhere . Explain more , please . Oh , and some evidence of incremental modifications would be nice too .
So lets ban cars ... They kill people ... And think all the money could go to public transportation . Also we should ban baseball bats as thats the obvious next step in weaponry ... Do n't forget archery ... Ca n't have the subjects have any of that ... Since we are taking away all these weapons to coddle the masses , Will the government be disarming too ? I see a need for both kinds of weapons as a freeman .
Certainly not . Natural selection is but one of the mechanisms that cause evolution .
The average global temperature follows a sinusoidal pattern , the general consensus is we are supposed to be approaching a peak . Projections show that instead of peaking , there will be continue to be an increase in average global temperature which exceeds that of the peak 4000 years previous .
So , you think there is a God ? Bad design does not equate to no design . It really is a poor argument . Much of the force of Darwin 's arguments deal with bad design . I invite anyone to post any of Darwin 's arguments that specifically outline his case against design because of `` bad '' design . That said , consider this , your car is said to operate at 25 % fuel efficiency . One could claim then the car is 75 % bad design , therefore it is not designed , and if it is , certainly not by anyone of any intelligence . Your audio CD 's have Reed-Solomon error correction because the read/write process is full of errors that need correcting . Cleary this is `` bad design '' that engineers would create read/write heads that make so many errors in the first place . Same with modems and host of other devices . Clearly if in the remote chance these bad designs are evidence of design , the designers must be clueless ! Poorly designed dramas have villains and heroes . Clearly a drama ( even a divine drama ) is poorly designed if it has villains in the story . All the characters should be Pollyanna and there should be no great tragedies on the road to a happy ending . Life and the Divine drama , like CD 's and cars , are clearly not designed , or at least not designed by anyone with intelligence , because of all the bad design woven into the designs . The reason audio CD 's have so many read/write errors which are corrected Reed-Solomon error correction ( somewhat like us reading someone 's writing and mentally correcting spelling and grammar errors ) is that it is the most optimal way to get as much data on a CD as possible . The tightest packing of data implies the highest amount of errors based on the Shannon capacity theorem . The Mp3 's and JPEGS are even more `` error '' prone in that they are inexact representations of the original sound or picture , but the goal was not fidelity but compactness . A similar consideration is for the 75 % inefficiency for cars . The goal is for higher acceleration and agility and cost , etc. , not fuel efficiency . The point is `` bad '' design , in the grand scheme of things , might not be bad design after all . The high rate of sickness and death , the eventual death of the universe as predicted by the 2nd law of thermodynamics are not evidences that the Designer is unwise , any more than the many errors in the read/write process of audio CD suggests the engineers of those devices are incompetent . Origin of Species Chapter 13 : There is another and equally curious branch of the present subject ; namely , the comparison not of the same part in different members of a class , but of the different parts or organs in the same individual . Most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous with that is correspond in number and in relative connexion with the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae . The anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and articulate classes are plainly homologous . We see the same law in comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans . It is familiar to almost every one , that in a flower the relative position of the sepals , petals , stamens , and pistils , as well as their intimate structure , are intelligible in the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves , arranged in a spire . In monstrous plants , we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another ; and we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals , and in flowers , that organs which when mature become extremely different , are at an early stage of growth exactly alike . How inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation ! Why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone ? As Owen has remarked , the benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition of mammals , will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of birds . Why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the wing and leg of a bat , used as they are for such totally different purposes ? Why should one crustacean , which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts , consequently always have fewer legs ; or conversely , those with many legs have simpler mouths ? Why should the sepals , petals , stamens , and pistils in any individual flower , though fitted for such widely different purposes , be all constructed on the same pattern ? On the theory of natural selection , we can satisfactorily answer these questions . Homology was a pre-darwinian idea with the term coined by Owen who rather despised Darwin and his ideas . Darwin tries to argue why a Designer would not use the same for the same function . He says homology is evidence of an unwise design . The premise is a Creator would n't be so inefficient . But , unless one has a handle on the teleological goal , one is free to fabricate all manner of `` bad design '' arguments ( for example read/write errors in audio CD 's or fuel inefficient cars ) . The Biotic Message Theory suggest the teleological goal for biotic reality is to communicate to humans that there is one Designer and author of life , and that life could not have evolved . Like a great novel , the `` imperfections '' of biology are part of a larger plot . It is turning out , Darwin 's argument from homology is a concept in crisis .
What I find hard to believe is that politicians will place their decision above the right to life of a human person only for political expediency .
Actually energy can be caused by matter . Newton 's Theory of Gravitation shows that gravity is an effect of the presence of mass . The presence of a second mass within the gravitation field of the first mass gives the matter gravitational potential energy , which , without an opposite force to balance it , is converted into kinetic energy .
You think so ? Then accept my terms . Go ahead . See if you 're right .
The latter does happen , though not often enough to explain evolution . Again , your 're bending over backwards to exclude one part of the ToE , but you 're using other parts of the ToE to try and do so . And you can certainly 'say ' whatever you like ; what would help is some evidence .
But if there are too many dogs wandering around they do not change to be cats , or rabbits , or humans do they . They do not change so as to have eight legs and spider eyes do they . But yes development of the phenotype is a result of the genetic heritage interacting with the environment , but its not an intelligent process . If you starve a young organism to near the point of death and then rescue it with food it will not develop as if it had food when it needed it . It will not express its full genetic potential . The environment OFTEN changes the outcome of development by imposing limits on reaching the biotic potential provided in the genome .
NO ! And it has nothing to do with expressing views different from mine . These XXXXXX are spending good money to advertise against a God they believe PROBABLY does n't exist . All I have to say is thanks for proving how irrational and stupid atheists are .
You are distorting my view . I certainly do not think that I am `` god '' or that everyone has to revolve around my standard . However , I do think that morality has to have a rational basis behind it . This is my particular rational basis . My moral code certainly is n't my own invention but is based on the moral codes which I have often heard expressed by others , as well as the moral code of the German philosopher Kant ( often referenced in secular moral discussions ) . Most people from childhood are taught morals at least partly from the same points of view I use . After all , how often have you heard the phrase `` How would YOU like it if that happenned to you ? '' or something similar . That is essentially the same as my basis of morality . It seems to be very common . Even many religions use a similar basic appoach - `` Do unto others ... '' . Of course , we all differ enough in our psychology that we might have some differences in how we would expect to be treated by others . So , this approach that I present would not lead to the same result in all people . Also , this approach depends on the capabilities of the person to see the big picture and to be able to fully see things from the other person 's point of view . Since we are imperfect in these skills , it certainly helps to have moral discussions , moral mentors , etc . who can enlighten us in various situations . It is not a perfect method but at least it is not arbitrary since it is based on reason . Note that the famous German philosopher Kant gave a similar secular moral code in his Categorical Imperative : `` Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law '' . Your view does n't seem to be based on reason but on a blind trust in a religious authority that tells you that a particular set of rules is right and must not be questioned . For those of us who do not hold the same beliefs as you , those rules often seem quite arbitrary . Sometimes some of the reasons behind those rules are illucidated , often not . Sometimes the rules are the same as those derived by secular reasoning , sometimes not . Personally , I would prefer an imperfect moral code that at least is based on reason and is refineable to one that is immovable and based on arbitrary standards . On a last note , there certainly could be moral codes that are based neither on religion nor on some version of the moral code which I have presented . If so , I would be quite interested in hearing them .
Substantiate this claim .
Really ? What evidence is that ?
By `` there is no evidence for a god , '' I mean that there is no evidence for a god . If you think otherwise , then start a new thread in the Religion forum and present some . But of course , when you claim evidence , you are denying faith . If you have empirical evidence of the existance of your god , then your god is not supernatural .
So just do what you say you are . And by the way we already know why fruit eating primates and their descendants lack a working copy of GLUO . Its been lost in SOME of the species in which it was not useful , and of course in species where it was useful it could not be lost since any individual carrying a defective gene would DIE and fail to REPRODUCE . Natural selection you understand !
What is your theory about the foot fetish gene ?
Well , now , here 's the thing : A hypothesis of special creation of all things ( such as is described in the bible ) is inconsistent with the evidence we can elicit from living things today . For instance , there 's the amount of non-functional DNA we share with other creatures , in particular the other apes . With shared functional DNA , now , one could make a case for economy of design , but deliberately putting the same broken genes and garbage DNA into two entirely seperate species ? Then there 's the fact that some creatures have far better 'designed ' bits than others for no readily apparent reason . A good example is the octopus eye , whose retina is supplied with blood from the rear rather than the front , both anchoring the retina more securely ( no detached retina problems ) and avoiding the 'blind spot ' mammalian eyes possess . There 's no reason at all for a designer capable of making an octupus to use the inferior mammalian design . Then there 's the issue of vestigial features . Vestigial does n't necessarily mean 'useless ' , more properly it describes something that is 'overengineered ' for the purpose it currently serves , and often looks very much like a crippled version of a feature possessed by some other species . Ostrich wings , for example , may be useful for balancing when running , or in mating rituals , but they do n't need to be wings in order to serve those purposes . Their complex and delicate internal structure is clearly 'designed ' to allow flight , but their stunted development and the practical impossibility of such a big bird achieving self-powered flight make them a vestigial structure . Again , what rationale can be made for this being the work of a designer ? Then there 's the fossil record . Try as one might to twist the evidence to fit a biblical flood , it just wo n't go . Paleontologists have found spider tracks sandwiched in sandstone layers . Imagine , if you can , the delicate impressions of a spider 's footsteps surviving a deluge sufficient to suspend and deposit yards and yards of sand atop them . Hydrodynamic sorting of fossils , or burial order , does n't fit either , since it requires that we pretend all dinosaurs were large and slow moving ( they were n't ) and that all mammals are small , agile and fast-moving ( they are n't ) . On and on it goes . If we take evolution off the table completely and look at the evidence before us , we have no explanation that fits . Special creation simply does n't add up . With all creation myths falsified , what are we supposed to do ? Just pretend the history of life on earth does n't matter , or should be ignored ? Evolution is n't what you come up with when you apply atheist thinking . Evolution is what you come up with when you discount all the extant hypotheses that do n't fit the facts , be they religiously inspired or otherwise . Now , you may hold your hand up and complain that we 're not admitting the possibility of some kind of divine guiding hand steering or helping evolution . And that 's fair enough ; we generally do n't , for two different reasons : First , it does n't really add anything to the theory ; it does n't increase its power to explain what we see . So while you can of course choose to believe that 's what 's happening , it does n't have any scientific value . Secondly , there 's arguably some merit in the attitude that religion has had its chance and blown it . For thousands of years religions have claimed to bear upon their backs the infallible word of god . Now , if the bible had been saying all along - centuries before the technology existed to verify it - that god coaxed organisms into evolving from simpler organisms over millions of years , that would be compelling evidence that the bible was accurate and divinely inspired , since it would contain accurate predictions ( which no man could have made ) about what we should find when we look into our DNA or beneath the ground . But it does n't make those predictions . So why should we now pay attention when Intelligent Design evangelists do a 6000-year-too-late handbrake turn and invent a new faith-based explanation for the evidence ? After all , they have no divine mandate to do so - it 's the bible that 's supposedly the word of god ; they 're just making stuff up as they go along .
Evolution has no goals , it is merely a beautiful process , like math . Do n't deify it . And who cares what we look like ?
Let 's look at the last 15 threads ( at the time of this posting ) on this forum ... you have created 12 of them from my count and none of them are more than a news post . As far as I can tell you have no argument .
So you evolved and the aryan race was created by God ? I have never heard that before .
I believe in God as he has worked in my life . I have no objection to your particular belief .
No scientists believe in gods ? How about the 35 % of the general population that are theists , but still accept evolution ?
Homosexuals are attracted to adults of the same sex . Pedophiles are attracted exclusively to children . There are people , such as the case with these priests , who molest children , who are not pedophiles . Molestation , like rape , is n't about sexual attraction . It is VIOLENCE . People do n't molest or rape because they are so turned on they ca n't help themselves , they do it to HURT somebody . Get some information before shooting off at the mouth VOR . Most of those priests were probably niether gay nor pedophiles . I HATE IT - when people spread this **** . It is FALSE information that does nothing but HARM . It puts blame on the innocent while the guilty get ignored and children get hurt . Do not use this lie to justify your bigotry - for you do so at the cost of innocent people - adults and children .
Fine by me . First , I do n't consider having a marriage recognized by government to be a `` right '' . Second , I 've said many times I do n't think government should be in the marriage business at all . I 'm a fan of less gov't not more .
And then you ask :
There are none . Men are automatically assumed guilty whenever the wife or girlfriend is involved .
TY . Not very persuasive , for an argument even in '41 . I should have mentioned in my 1st post the question was about the present .
One of these aspects of existence which we arbitarily believe in is cause and effect . Another is the external world . A third is the consciousness of others . A fourth is the past etc . etc .
That does n't prove the government should n't be armed . It 's not like one politician can single-handedly kill millions of people . In fact , if the whole U.S. Congress one day decided to get up from their offices and try to invade a small town called Kittanning , Pennsylvania , they would fail . What it does prove that the government takes guns away because they do n't trust the little people . We should all start wondering `` why not ? ''
100 % In order for a round to be considered `` armor piercing '' , it has to have a penetrator . As long as you are not using .223 with a penetrator , you have NO legal issues at a federal level . That particular round penetrated EVERY piece of body armor that we tested with the exception of the new stuff we were testing . The new stuff is a composite , a ceramic metal matrix shell over a honeycomb carbon composite . I weighed 85 lbs , so it is not something that you are going to see guys running around in ( though I do have several sets that we constructed for the testing that I could sell for around $ 200,000.00 each ) . You MIGHT have feed problems ( we did ) with the round , in which case you need to take a dremel and smooth out your feed ramp . No big deal . Out of a makarov ( short barrel ) we were getting around 2850 FPS . Out of a bizon ( 15 inch barrel ) we were at about 3000 FPS , well into rifle velocity land . The REAL benifit to a round like this ( since I assume that most people are not simply looking to load cop killers ) is that you have in inherently stable round , the .223 , being fired at near rifle velocity , from a pistol . The round is stable to roughly 150 yards , then it begins to deteriorate . 3 '' groupings at 100 yards with our old POS test weapon were not uncommon . 1.5 '' with the bizon .
None . It doesnt take thousands/millions of years to adapt , as youve been told and shown evidence of dozens of times .
Well it 's been illegal in other places and is legal now what 's your point ? I suggest in the context of this discussion you take a world perspective -- abortion happens all over the world surely your objective is to see abortion eradicated globally ? Chinese unborn 'potential humans ' for example are equal as American unborn 'potential humans ' are they not ?
No , i was not trying to make that point . I was in a heterosexual marriage for many of the same reasons that Justine has addressed . I just have never mentioned it before in this forum .
Well you seem to be going against what your theory says ... .here 's an overview : ( please notice there is no mention of epigenetics , nonrandom mutations , the inheritance of acquired characteristics , adaptive mutations , or horizontal gene transfer -- all of which can bring about new traits/functions . http : //www.biologycorner.com/bio3/notes-chap17.html How Organisms Evolve Evolution occurs on populations , not individuals . Individuals do not evolve , but are part of populations which do Evolution is a genetic change occuring in a population of organisms over many generations Population Genetics - branch of biology that deals with the frequency , distribution and inheritance of alleles ( genes ) in a population A gene pool is the sum of all the genes occuring in a population The Mechanisms of Evolution There are five majore causes of evolutionary change within a population 1. mutation 2. migration 3. small population 4. nonrandom mating 5. natural selectionGenetic Drift - small populations are more effected by random chance Your theory is OUTDATED !
Because they are unable to maintain a pregnancy - money , job and education security , health ( physical , mental and emotional ) . I do feel that more open adotion would help . A lot of women ca n't go through the pregnancy and then just have the baby disappear into the wild blue unknown .
And in fact that WAS a part of morality at one time -- morality changed , only further demonstrating that it 's arbitrary . What is morality for one time frame may not be for another , and what is morality for one person may not be for another . The rub comes when an individual 's morality goes against any given standard that is set by society . And the issue of abortion is a battle over that standard .
Look Bell - your point is made .
That was n't my question . My question was n't what you said , but what you believed . You sort of answered that . But the same people spouting off about the second ammendment being the reason for guns should also be for it defending your right to a nuclear bomb .
Right . But in this case , there are two different populations
Based on their definitions . It has nothing to do with opinion . A circle can not be a square .
I know that I 'm hardly unique in rejecting the pious life that my teachers held up as the ideal : I was quite conscious at the time that I was merely a square peg in a round hole that was being bashed until it fitted . Parroting answers to questions that were themselves irrational wasted an absurd amount of time of course - but in other respects I received a good education for which I am still grateful . Nice to hear from someone who had a similar experience .
How would you like to have a parasite in your body and not be given treatment to remove it based solely on the fact that even parasitic organisms are living things and deserve life ? Not pretty is it ? Imagine being one of those guys in the Alien movies and you 've got a chestburster in you that 's gon na kill you once its fully gestated , but you 're not allowed to have an operation to have it removed from your body because of an intergalatic treaty declaring that all life is precious and must be observed .
Where are those organizations with such scientific rigor ? If they truly do exist , they must be in the position to understand the God of the Gaps they 're worshipping has become microscopic .
Then it is also not the place for abiogenesis , and so many other forms of science that presuppose that there is no God . Yet they are there , so ID should be there .
Well the IDers DID discover that Behe does not make a very good wittness and Behe discovered that people had actually researched the origins of the immune system - AT THE SAME TIME . Now thats discovery for you .
The only person who can take away your sin is God . No human can ever cleanse himself of his sins , so get over it .
I am not religious . However , I have spent some time studying religion , and your analysis is problematic . For a start , most early religions do n't have an idea of heaven or even an afterlife ( eg . early Judaism and Hinduism , both focused on success in this life ) . Also , 2000 years ago many were aware the world was round .
Here is the link to the report Brady mentions : http : //www.bradycampaign.org/xshare/ ... eport.pdfBrady Im sorry , Brady , that you feel Obama has betrayed you by supporting ( or at least not opposing ) a few gun owner friendly initiatives . And here I thought this was supposed to be change you could believe in . Have you ever thought to consider he does so because he thinks it is the right thing to do ? Are you willing to consider his motives and give him the benefit of the doubt ? Probably not . You probably think he is just afraid to upset gun owners . And there is probably some truth in this . Based upon his past rhetoric I do not doubt that Obama would push gun control if he thought he could . But you have to look at things from his perspectivea what is best for me as politician viewpoint . You have only yourself to blame if youre disappointed in Obama . It was you and people like you at the BC who placed such unrealistic hopes in him without considering how little he needed your support . Guns were not an issue in his election , and contrary to whatever you might believe he does not owe his position to the support of the BC . Really now , with everything else he is trying to accomplish , what do the complaints of a fringe anti-gun group with limited membership matter to him ? Its not like you and the other BC supporters are going to vote for Sarah Palin in the next election . At worst , Obama knows you could grow petulant and boycott him by refusing to vote at all in the next election . But he can calculate how few votes he would really loose . Look at it from his perspective , Brady . The BC competes directly with the NRA . Both organizations make their own arguments , use their own rhetoric , cite their own statistics and studies , and yet it is the NRA which dominates with membership . The bottom line is the NRA and BC have for years gone head to head in the free marketplace of ideas , and the BC has lost . It is the NRA which has several million members , not the BC . And , in addition to normal membership fundraising there are hundreds of non-profit tax-exempt Friends of the National Rifle Association fundraising committees nationwide . Friends of NRA , National Rifle Association of America Each one is a local grassroots organization made up of volunteer community business and social leaders , and each one hosts an annual banquet to raise money which is spent back in the local communityprimarily for youth shooting sports and education to ensure the future of responsible gun ownership in America . The BC has no way to challenge this kind of grassroots power . The NRA offers a positive message to its members . You have the right to keep and bear arms . You can be trusted to make decisions about the security of yourself and your family . Punish the criminal , and leave the law abiding alone . The NRA dominates the political landscape because , like AARP , this message attracts millions of members . People who are willing to donate their time , their money , and cast their votes to support the RKBA . People like me , Brady , who have done more to fight gun crime this month than you have done in your entire life . Look at it from Obamas perspective , Brady . What does the BC offer to oppose this ? It peddles fear . It offers tired complaints about how people can not be trusted to care for themselves . It takes hypocritical positions which undermine its credibility . For example , it claimed the NRAs Eddie Eagle program message was ineffective , and then it decided to sell the exact same message under its own name . Chilling Resemblance Between North Korean Indoctrination and the Eddie Eagle program It still offers a re-tread of a failed assault weapons bandespite knowing it was a failure . And it has supporters like you , Bradypeople who want the failed AW Ban back so bad they are willing to make up a lie to sell it to us , only to run away and hide when you got caught lying : Rise in Police Deaths because no Ban on Assault Weapons No , I havent forgotten that one . Brady , you can not expect Obama to waste political capital fighting against such a large number of gun owning voters over ideas so bankrupt you must make up lies to support them . And dont call him a traitor when you know youve given him no cause to feel confident in your own support of him . If he took on gun owners , then do you really think he can rely upon the support of someone like you who lies and then runs away at the first sign of a challenge ? If you really want his support , then first offer him something he can actually sell to the public with a straight face and then give him some assurance you wont run away at the first sign of trouble .
And the comments section is usually where the real comedy lies .
And would not being 'too competitive ' lead to a monopoly ? ( if not for govenment action )
gooey cute as this reads , how is this relevant to the philosophy discourse ?
You mentioned him once or twice . I could give a rats a $ $ about him . My concern is for you or anyone else who is in your situation . If you end up getting shot , as you walk towards that light remember you had ample opportunity to have prevented the dire mess you may find yourself in ! It was not the guns fault , heck it really was not your brothers fault ... It would have been your fault because you failed to act . This line has nothing to do with my position on guns or trying to get a `` one up '' on the debate . You are in a dire LIFE THREATENING emergency much worse than me owning every mortar , grenade , f16 , m16 , ak-47 in the world . Do you get it ?
Our national parks are safe as is , huh ? Regular people have no reason to feel to need to carry concealed weapons for their own protection , huh ? How can you be safe when mexican drug cartel members are literally behind the next bush and inclined to kill you for stumbling upon their operation ?
It 's just the same flip flopping over and over . Depending on the argument , `` science does n't exclude the divine '' , { then switcharoo } , `` science proves there is no divine . '' Just depends on the setting of the argument . ( you do have your copy of Victor Stenger 's book ; God - The failed Hypothesis / how science shows that God does not exist , do n't you ? Now you and five trolls will come pouring in here with needling and ad hominem attacks , to cover the weakness of your position . Your taunt of `` XXXXXX '' already got it started . I probably wo n't respond - it 's funny and depressing at the same time .
As long as we cut off the privates of the fathers as well .
No . That would be adaption . It would n't involve any genetic change . Another word for it might aclimatization . Your example shows little thought . The Polar bear 's webbed feet are genetic . Even if a Polar bear lived it 's whole live in a cage without ever going near water , it would still have webbed feet . That really is absolutely the most ignorant thing I have ever heard . The water stretches the skin through friction ! Do n't you just love `` creation science '' ? You get to make it up as you go .
See the above critique . Of course , this also is underestimating the power of natural selection and random varition , and includes the logical fallacy of personal incredibiltiy .
It is my understanding that the rules are if you 're banned , you ca n't simply create a new ID and return under it . This happened when Terral03 was banned and returned using a new ID . But ... How do you know that Lurch is Ungerdunn ? Perhaps also you might want to consider where you should have posted this thread as it has nothing to do with Creation -v- Evolution .
Well , criticism of your opinions is n't hard to find here . What is interesting is that you rarely have anything substantial against those criticisms . After all , you said that bees can not fly , tv show props are good evidence of creationism , and that oil is not a hydrocarbon . Your opinion does not count for much given its consistent history of massive and epic levels of incorrectness . Interesting how you think that because we arouse through natural processes we do n't have any more value than anything else that arouse through natural processes . Sterile sand is natural . So is uranium . Tell me , which is more valuable ?
Actually it was a gun registration that occurred five years before Hitler came to power . Only why would you need gun registration if guns were illegal ? The public was armed just no one knew who . What the registration did was allow the Nazis to know who was armed and allowed them disarm those who were not in the party .
So your biased reading of the Bible coupled with your personal flaws and your misunderstanding of science is the basis of your religiosity ? Somehow I do n't think that 's something you 'd really want to brag about ...
... so are you saying that degrees of humanity are separated due to levels of dependence ? What about the astronaut who is connected to the shuttle by a cord - does that mean the astronaut all of a sudden drops a degree in humanity ?
Yep , suppressing natural behavior is always the way to go . We should also get them to stop pooping .
REALLY ? let me reword it for the simple people ... If you are old enough to decide to die in the military for YOUR COUNTRY - you are old enough and mature enough to reasonably care for fire arms properly . IF you can LEGALLY join the military ( as in not a traitor or a criminal ) you should ALSO be allowed to own any weapon you can personally purchase . QUESTION : Are you a MODERATE or really pro FREEDOM ? with an attitude like yours - you MUST be a friggin wishy washy moderate !
Like the crusades and the inquisition ? How about the Southern Baptist Convention , formed at the end of the Civil War with the express purpose to discriminate against blacks ? And of course , the KKK and the Aryan Brotherhood make the same claims as you . Of course , you 're going to tell me that you are a christian and they are n't . But when people tell me they are christians you are n't always around so I just never turn my back on them . That way , even if they are follow that strange pull to make a bad decision , I will at least have my eye on my money .
Yes , do you ? It 's in a country with no medical facilities , no sterile place to get it done . A country full of HIV and AIDS . I would n't be surprised if these mothers had HIV/AIDS and knew they 'd leave their child an orphan .
So the fact that we still have criminals who choose to kill others , should be used against is in determining whether we can be trusted or not ?
Can you read ? You linked to a site that is essentially a bibliography . The title is `` Feminism AND Science . '' Did you intend to mislead ?
Probably part of the dems ' voter registration drive . Their new plan is to let convicted felons `` restore lost voting rights '' . They probably have a conflict of interest on restoring all civil rights , just the one that helps them get elected and re-elected since that is a major portion of dems anyway ...
And pray tell what new and interesting creatures have you seen the present ones evolve into this week ?
Here is the definition of militia : Function : noun Etymology : Latin , military service , from milit- , miles Date : circa 1660 1 a : a part of the organized armed forces of a country liable to call only in emergency b : a body of citizens organized for military service 2 : the whole body of able-bodied male citizens declared by law as being subject to call to military service Ok here is the 2nd amend : A well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed . Now if you read the definition of militia as a citizen of America I could be called up to serve in one . But no where can the gun haters produce one document stating a requirement to be in a militia to bear arms . All gun haters want is to do is put limits on the right to bear arms . Once this limit is on the right to bear arms the gun haters will say now that we have a standing military we no longer need militias . So guess what just happened to the right to bear arms . This is why the founding fathers put no limits on our rights . This is why the founding fathers describe our rights as the right of the people ! This is why they are not collective rights like the gun haters want to claim . Gun haters like the word collective . Gun haters will use the communist tactics to harass and threaten people gun haters can not shut up !
Such black and white thinking places the Supreme Court and the NRA at one time in the category of gun banners . The Supreme Court stated that only firearms in common use receive Second Amendment protection . The NRA once supported a ban on Saturday Night Specials : `` Viewed realistically , junky .22 handguns that retail for as little as $ 7.98 . . . are n't suited for target shooting , handgun hunting , or police or protection purposes . Most honest-to-goodness gun owners would n't have one around . Yet the reckless use of such junk has harmed legitimate firearms ownership . '' - '' Restraint on TV , Cheap Handguns Wins Favor , '' American Rifleman , ( March 1968 ) `` On the Saturday Night Special , we are for it [ banning ] 100 percent . We would like to get rid of these guns . `` 36 -NRA Executive Vice President Maxwell Rich , Senate Hearings on Saturday Night Special Ban , ( September 13 , 1971 )
Oh , and I found this from here : http : //www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291 `` The discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication . In nature , bacteria are rarely found in isolation , and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities , to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments , and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression . '' It appears biologists have n't gotten it wrong , evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling . And the bacteria still is n't exhibiting any intelligence . The only one getting anything wrong here is you .
Millions of Athiests trying to make up for lost time
I 'd love to see an explanation about how the study of the natural world disproves the existence of all Deities . Especially the Deistic Gods . And I 'd love to see how science is suppose to disprove a being that is not bound by logic , reason or any laws . What science can do is disprove that God was directly responsible for this or that , the sun rising , the rain season , etc . Did you perhaps realize that many scientists are Buddhists because Buddhism which has beings that behave as Gods with such powers and exist partially within the natural and supernatural ? Or are you again assuming all religions do n't exist except for Christanity ?
And Hogwarts seems like a great school according to the first Harry Potter .
Some interesting information , that website where you got your link from , `` Reasons To Believe '' ( RTB ) is not a creationist organisation . It is run by compromising Christians , such as Dr Hugh Ross . Answers in Genesis have got quite a lot of information on him and as a result have even more rebuttals to his arguments . Here are several links : http : //www.answersingenesis.org/docs/4149.asp http : //www.answersingenesis.org/docs/4128.asp I did notice , however , that the RIB article was written in the year 1999 . This is most pecular , because the AiG article in which Dr Russell Humphreys defends himself is written in the year 2000 . The following link is a very brief summary of how Dr Humphreys defended himself and his new Relativistic Cosmology from compromising Christians and evolutionists : http : //www.answersingenesis.org/docs ... 10-10-2000.asp The following link is where Dr Russell Humphreys defends himself . It shows both the arguments and his rebuttals : http : //www.trueorigin.org/ca_rh_03.asp I would strongly suggest that you read it . I can definitely see how you may doubt Dr Humphreys new Cosmology , that was a pretty heavy attack , the much of it went zip , right over my head . But I just ca n't help but feel that they mis-interpreted several lines and are using some straw man attacks . I personally can not see anything wrong with his arguments , although if there is , he has given way for a new area of cosmology , a Creationist Cosmology . I hope that this helps clear up this little problem regarding `` Starlight and Time '' . Got to go , Matt .
None ... unless she uses abortion as a form of birth control and has them regularly .
I 'm sure you reproduce these quotes in good faith , but you ought to know they are not necessarily what they seem . The Darwin quote is a particularly craven quote mine : he was expressing empathy with those of his readers who found it difficult to imagine how such a thing as an eye could evolve by stages ; effectively putting himself in their place so that he might more readily take them by the hand and show them how such evolution may occur , with ample supporting evidence from the natural world . I refer you to the Quote Mine Project for further edification .
That 's idiotic . A literal reading of Genesis is rejected by every major sect of Christianity . What kind of a XXXXX looks at a bat and then claims that it is a bird because it says so in the wholey buybull ? You 've got to be a freek to count 6 legs on grasshoppers and then claim that your scripture is without error , even when it says they have 4 .
Creationism is not something new , it was the prevailing view of scientists up until Darwin . None of them belived in a divine parrot that is just plain silly . In the crucible of natural science throughout the Middle Ages , the Scientific Revolution and well into the 19th century theology was the queen of the sciences . Now we subject students to higher math studies that they will most likely never use and speculations about conceptual mechanisms like natural selection that have no practical application . Naturalistic presumption has become sacrosanct in the rhetoric of the professional scientists who have been crystal clear on how they define creationism . You can ignore the statement by D.J.Futuyma and identical ones made by Gould , Mayr , Dawkins , Dobzhansky and others but not without departing from mainstream evolutionary biology .
You toss out a false assessment as to what you THINK we `` believe '' , and ignore the very real reasons why we have explained that this legislation should fail . And in the course of Archie 's reply , he makes a statement so Freudian it 's kinda funny . Yup ! It 's an Archie reply ... You ask `` What 's a guy aspoda do '' For starters , you could address WHAT WE SAID on the topic instead of tossing out lame allegations . You evidently think it 's okay for the LEGISLATURE to politicize education certification according to their pet PERSONAL theories . You could start by explaining WHY you think this is valid .
All of that sounds a lot like Deism . Personally , if I was somehow FORCED to believe in a religion , based on what I currently know of the lot , it would be Deism .
How about a link , to the entire page ?
It contradicts a literal interpretation of the Bible .
But nonetheless fascinating !
Events prior to the Big Bang are unknowable , so why worry about them ?

Thus , an important point is raised :
If information came into being by chance , how can we know that anything is true ? How do you know what is false and what is `` true '' ? If we are just products of chance , your brain is also a product of chance . Therefore , the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance . If your logic is the result of chance processes , you ca n't even be sure it evolved properly . You ca n't even be sure you can reason properly ( using your definition ) because you ca n't trust your own logic . As for the second part , no , you 've got it backward , rational belief is based on faith in a rational creator .

And your point is ... ?
The quote below which Obvious Child responded to does n't make enough sense to be an argument for anything . This whole thing about living side by side with carnivirous crocs by feeding them chicken has little to do with anything , really . Servant of Christ says : `` Thus , the scenes of the African villagers mingling with the crocodiles corroborate that humans could have lived alongside ( or nearby ) even carnivorous dinosaurs . The original magical place where that happened was the Garden of Eden , before any animals had turned to carnivory. ``
I know the feeling . Its very , very easy to make a statement associating two things ( like racism and scientific evolution ) its an altogether tricker one to then defend that statement against thorough scrutiny . Or should I say they [ YEC 's ] like to teach the contoversy ? Just challenge their assertions , when they do n't defend them and disappear it shows they are just taking the Michael .
Nope , rather I 'm suggesting you consider her an easy target because you did n't want anyone else interjecting -- you wanted your prey to remain without more skilled allies .
A pregnancy .
Wrong , the muder rate has been cut substantially since the 1980s . There has been a steady decline in the US for violent crime over the last 25 years . http : //www.fbi.gov/filelink.html ? fil ... xl/01tbl01.xls Some facts for those interested in what a failure law enforcement has been . Direct numbers . Showing that both numbers and per capita rates have declined steadily for the last 10 to 15 years . Hardly an indication of anything being a failure or not working frankly .
By far most speech about homosexuality from those who do n't approve is not hate speech . You 've been listening to too much propaganda from gay lobby groups who think demonizing and working toward persecuting Christians for their beliefs is the best means to an end . If Canada limited it 's persecution only to those who are trying to change the law , there would n't be a problem .
And the state ... States can have armies ... The people are the Militia .
Do n't get me wrong sleazyrider I love babies , they 're delicious !
Really , then show me how I 'm wrong - without dogmatic statements . I would suggest , given the fact that you feel the need to ignore science , deny obvious facts of reason , and cling to evolutionary theory , that it is you that has the problem with religion - your naturalistic religion . I would further suggest that you stop attibuting your personal opinions to science , and start calling your comments what they really are , personal opinion . -By the way , is everyone who disagrees with you promoting a `` religious agenda ? '' Where have I leaned on religion to make my point ? And what makes you think that I need religion to defeat your postion as I have here ? I 've used science , scientific journals , and good sound reasoning to defeat your comments . I suggest you rethink what you 're saying . It sure sounds like you 're the one with the `` religious agenda . ''
Nope . It was Darwin . There are letters in which Darwin proposed his theory to friends as early as 1844 . Several of the leading scientists of Darwin 's day were aware of his theory .
As the Christian Right 's poster boy , this is hugely damaging , do n't you think ? Also makes him very hypocritical ( or , dare I say , a FLIPFLOPPER ? ! ) since he is campaigning against open abortion now .
So not only has the new functionality evolved once , its evolution has been reproduced in a different species under laboratory conditions . Food for thought ?
What , you mean like this story ( http : //news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3136266.stm ) of scientists warning about ocian acidity levels from 2003 ? Global warming is old news too : it does n't seem to have reached the more remote parts of the world though , like North America for example .
They do offer a good insulating blanket which would keep the body of the reptile warm which in turn , would allow the reptile to remain active for a longer period of time . This means more time to hunt and reproduce carrying the mutation onwards .
No , it does n't . The big picture of evolution is that it is the observed change in the heritable characteristics in populations of organims over generations . In cases where populations become fragmented , the separate ( reproductively isolated ) segments of the population will accumulate genetic differences . The longer they are separated , the more likely it will be that they will be unable to interbreed if united . This is observed . The result is the establishment of separate species .
Rosie O'Donnell publicly stated that she felt anyone who owned a gun should be sent to prison . However she has armed bodyguards to protect herself and her children . Talk about a hypocritical sow .
Actually he wasnt or I would n't have used that example .
Actually I believe life begins at conception , that that life matters and abortion ends that life . I also believe mama comes first and until we can seriously address the issues faced by pregnant women rather than demonizing them that they will abort whether it 's legal or not . I also believe that there are times when abortion is appropriate and necessary .
How often to you poke your nose into monkey genitals in order to know that ?
Well that 's true under one condition : that there is such thing as a random mutation that creates a new , beneficial body part or function . I 'm not sure this has ever been established as fact . ( How does science go about proving randomness in a mutation , anyway ? ... it seems to me that one must accept that mutations are random by faith . ) `` It is our contention that if random is given a serious and crucial interpretation from a probabilistic point of view , the randomness postulate is highly implausible and that an adequate scientific theory of evolution must await the discovery and elucidation of new natural laws . `` *Murray Eden , `` Inadequacies of Neo-Darwinian Evolution as Scientific Theory , '' in Mathematical Challenges to the Neo-Darwinian Theory of Evolution ( 1967 ) , p. 109 . This still means a population containing a range of variants that natural selection can act on , preserving some epigenetic alterations as opposed to others . but if the variation is nonrandom , it does n't matter : selection 's role , like I said above , would be doing nothing more than eliminating the weaklings . According to ToE , selection is a creative force of evolution , guiding the direction of evolution . Gould : The central logic of Darwinism requires that natural selection not merely operate , but that it be the creative force of evolutionary change . Selection wins its role as a creative force because the other component of evolutionary mechanics  the forces that produce the raw material of genetic variation  are random , in the special sense of not inherently directed toward adaptation. That is , if local environments change and smaller organisms are now at an advantage , genetic variation does not produce more small individuals , thus imparting a direction to evolutionary change from the level of variation itself . Variation continues to occurat random ,  in a broad spectrum about the average size . Selection must impart direction  and be the creative force of evolution  by differentially preserving those random variants yielding smaller than average phenotypes .
Great site ! I know I 'll refer to it in the future . Thanks .
I 'm sorry , this is pretty damn funny , coming from a pro-life person
No . I never mentioned grades . You brought that one up . I 'm saying that having guns on school campus is n't a good plan due to the high level of emotions in the area .
I suspect that haste had little to do with the suckiness of your definition . * In re : your rhetorical questions as to whether creationism is religion or if it is science . Actually , the courts of the U.S. have clearly stated that creationism is religion and is not science . That is the basis for the exclusion of the teaching of creationism from public school science classes . Laws that have forbidden the teaching of evolutionary biology or required the teaching of creationism , whether alone or in `` balance '' with evolutionary biology , are violations of the establishment clause of the 1st Amendment . See : ( Epperson v. Arkansas , 393 U.S. 97 [ 1968 ] ) , ( McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education , 529 F. Supp 1255 [ 1982 ] ) , and ( Edwards v. Aguillard , 482 U.S. 578 [ 1987 ] )
How the heck is that `` dishonest '' ? A church 's opinion was quoted . Nobody said they were `` anti-gay '' . WHERE is the `` dishonesty '' ? You 're developing a tendency to label anything you disagree with as `` dishonest '' ...
Well , I am sure that if you gave a piece of petrified wood to a scientist , they would be able to find out the difference between the old stuff , and the man made stuff .
Do you mean like Piltdown Man ? It was displayed there for 40 years . `` The Eoanthropus dawsoni , or Piltdown Man , was on display at the Natural History Museum in London for 40 years . It was removed when advanced dating techniques not only showed that the bones were only a few hundred years old , but that some of them were n't even human . '' http : //www.mentalfloss.com/press_oklahoman2.htm Do you guarantee that all of the other displays at the Museum are true ? No , of course not . Many other things there said to be 'true ' are only 'true ' in a transient sense of the word ( that only science seems to use ) http : //www.clarku.edu/~piltdown/map_ ... klywiener.html Suggests that Piltdown Man had good science behind it , at the time . Never-the-less the Natural History Museum provides many examples of artistic licence , such as the 'human-like ' hand given to a restoration of Australopithecus , displayed at the museum . `` Shattering the Myths of Darwinism '' , p205
Because all you ever do is accuse them of being a phony ( a.k.a . atheist ) as soon as they reveal that their theological beliefs do n't precisely match yours .

I 'm perfect .
So thanks to this candid statement we can throw the usual nit-picking of the science points 1-16 out the window and get the crux of the issue . Creationists can not tolerate humanism . Attacking evolution is a good way of attacking humanism or anything that takes our minds outside of the boundaries of a literal reading ( and interpretation ) of the Bible . Now thats nice and succinct . Would any creationists care to comment on why they are not upfront on this fundemental issue more often ? Why is `` humanism '' so problematic ? Other comments are most welcome of course .
Oh , yeah , the show went into this . They did n't really talk about T. rex that much at all . But they were pretty sure that the feathered dinosaurs must have been `` warm-blooded '' or somewhere toward truly warm blooded . There are still some animals today that are n't all the way ( but dinos , or some dinos , could have been all the way , who knows ? ) http : //coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/i ... /coldwarm.html
Because the Heller ruling did nothing to dissolve the slippery slope argument .
Because it 's simply too obviously true ?
Thank you for your criticism . : D
If Obama gets elected he will walk straight into the worse financial crisis in the states for decades . Within weeks Russia , North Korea and Iran will test his resolve ( China will wait to see what he does ) . This will keep him busy for a while . The last thing that he will want to do will be to address controversial issues like gun control or abortion . This will come in his second term or never !
Who said anything about `` redefining '' it ? I said you would still HAVE YOUR `` traditional marriage '' according to YOUR chosen religion .
An unfertilized egg or sperm alone will not grow up into a person . So it does NOT have that potential at all .
Well , yeah , if science has n't provided an explanation for a phenomenon , then all we can do is shrug and submit grant proposals .
Well ! I guess that just showed you guys . It seems that HeavenBound thinks that having a closed mind is a bad thing . And yet ,
You started off with criticizing gun banning , but now you seem to be criticizing tough punishments for criminals . A May 2006 article in the Cape Times said that `` National law currently provides for a sentence of 25 years for illegal firearm possession . '' http : //www.capetimes.co.za/index.php ... icleId=3230121 So if the death penalty is the punishment for illegal gun possession then I suppose the law must have changed recently . I wonder if the people who claim that we do n't need more gun laws but just tougher punishments for people who break current gun laws would support such a penalty .
Well , how else were they supposed to reproduce ?
Is n't this just saying that you ca n't even put the moral belief of not putting you moral beleifs on people on to others . At which point the whole moral thing breaks down anyway .
You are welcome . The idea that one would learn science from scientists seemed somehow obvious to me . The idea is somehow more complex than I imagined . If I am sick I do not consult my plumber or my mechanic . On the other hand , I do n't consult a geologist if my car breaks down . Where else would you learn science but from scientists ? How do you propose to learn about biology but from biologists ? How else do you propose to learn about science without reading books and papers written by scientists ? So yes indeed . A `` detailed '' study of a topic requires reading some actual significant literature or actually taking a course at some university . I 'll give you a hint though . Evolutionary biology classes are upper division - you 'll need 18 to 20 semester hours in biology to get in the door . In my day that it also required a course in genetics - which required a course in zoology and a course in botany . I mean , how can you claim to have done a detailed study if you have n't read anything written by an evolutionary biologist or taken a single course in evolutionary biology ? It 's a bit like claiming that I have done a detailed study of christianity by reading Stephen King novels . The problem is that you made up your mind before you knew the facts . You only sought information from sources who would tell you what you wanted to hear . You do n't have the knowledge to judge the scientific validity of the information . And yet you claim that you have done a detailed study of the topic with an open mind . I 'll give you a hint . I spent a year , an hour a day , 5 days a week , studying the Bible with a Bible scholar ( PhD ) . We read it cover to cover . That does n't even begin to touch on my studies in philosophy and theology . To learn about Christianity and the Bible , I went to theologeans an Bible scholars - I did n't consult one plumber or even an evolutionary biologist . So please . Exactly how did you accomplish your detailed study of evolution without reading a single piece of evolutionary literature or taking a single course in biology ? I am baffled .
Intellignet design seems to have a large following . The fact that somebody believes in intellient design does not necessarily mean that they disagree with evolution . A lot of folks ( I would say the majority ) view it as evolution used as a vehicle for intellient design ( basically `` god planned it and made it all happen '' ) . The movement to teach YEC is non existant . Creationism does not necessarily=YEC . The YEC crowd is their own little clique of scientific illiterates . I have been on the local board of education for 2 years now and have never heard the phrase `` Young Earth Creationists '' in any official capacity , nor has anybody ever suggested that it be taught . I had no idea what a `` young earth creationist '' was until I read it on this board , 6 months ago . It is simply not an issue , and I am right in the middle of Kansas .
got ta start at square 1. it seems the best definition anybody came up with for God is `` the greatest possible being '' . this means a being that can do and know anything and everything that is POSSIBLE to do and know . this obviously means that God can not do the impossible if everybody can agree on this , then we could really work on acknowledging what God can do , and even if he can exist i would like to start by asserting that the `` greatest possible being '' DOES exist . this has been proven
I think what people fail to realise is that the state school board in kansas does nto have the same power as school boards in other states . In ks , our state schoolboard is a buch of twits who seem to want to make life difficult for local schoolbord memebrs who have to field calls from parents concerned about the action of the state board , and they have to be continually assured that it will not have any effect on their childs education at a local level ... ..nobody actually reads that **** anyway . You can point the following facts out to those who tell us we are XXXXXX in kansas who do not know how to run our schools : ACT Scores : Kansas has the 8th highest national scores ; the highest combination of scores and percentage of students tested . ( 2000 scores ) SAT Scores : Kansas has the 5th highest scores nationally . ( 1998 scores ) NAEP Reading Scores : National Assessment of Education Progress . Only one state had a higher average score and percentage of students at or above proficient level than Kansas for fourth grade ; only two states scored higher at eighth grade . There is a lot of stuff that pandion is saying `` you do n't learn in high school '' that my teachers tell me they are teaching . Then again , we also rank first when it comes to introducing college level curriculum to in our high schools . Maybe that is another reason that this is an issue brought up in kansas . Besides the fact that it is incredibly easy to get somethign in front of the school borad , the fact that we are covering more adcvanced curriculum might make this an isse . Youw ne tot the shawnee mission school district , which was THE highest ranked distict int he coutnry for 18 years running . Maybe we should mirror the KCMO school district , then there would not be these debates in Ks . I know a teacher in kansas city missouri ( a biology teacher no less ) who essentially says the same thing that pandion does ... .that they do not teach these things in high school . If we turned out dumber kids , and wrenched control away fro local schoolboards and parents , we could probably turn out kids that are as dumbn as california kids , or illinois kids , or maybe , with the addition of mandatory labotomies , we could turn out kids as dumb as washington DC kids . THEN , we would not have such debates , . I do n't know that they are as small a minority as you are trying to say here , but even if they were , they are in a position of power . So the media is n't blowing this out of proportion . It does n't matter if a group is a minority if they are in power . Should Iraq have not been in the news before the war because the minority was in power there ? A crude anology I know , but you get the point . [ /quote ]
I think the same about religion . Why should you get your way and tryannise women , and I not get mine ?
Translation ; `` Do what I say or I will kick your @ ss . '' Sounds a lot like the mafia . And you love this diety ?

I do n't believe Hell is a place either ( or even if I believe in hell to begin with ) , but tell me more about what you mean by this . It sounds interesting .
You 're a little confused about that . It 's all real DNA . Some of it just does n't code for anything . But some parts of non-coding DNA ( which you call `` junk '' ) has other functions besides coding for proteins .
Really ? The poster seems to be insinuating that people who express doubts suffer some kind of sanction . Could he/she please elaborate ?
So you plan to move out of N.Y.in a year or two , and own a gun ? why not now ? N.Y.laws are sticker than most , but not all.You want to teach your kids to shoot ? Better do it now , later on it will probably be harder . Well if you do n't think that gun control is the most important issue in the world and you totally agree that people should be able to own guns , but yet you have no problems with states making it mandatory for gun owners to have permits , thats almost a contradiction of terms for someone that says their pro gun . I may be wrong but is anyone saying or implying total gun freedom ? What we are saying is , to many laws on it no more . 35-40 years ago we did n't have all this B.S.about it , you wanted a gun you went and got one ( in other words very readily available ) Walk down the street with one and you did n't have a S.W.A.T.team on you . We have seen to many gun rights taken so yeah every time a new policy or amendment comes along we are antsy about it . So if you support every amendment made to the constitution pertaining to guns , than I submit your not to interested in owning a gun . And for the record : gun toting bandits ( out here we say bandito 's ) are jumping out of every ally { figuratively speaking } .But the pro-gunners know that if the anti-gunners had their way , only the bandito 's have guns .
I dunno . Do you think the Tooth Fairy will be happy with people drink-driving ? Any argument from a religious stand-point necessitates proving that said religion is true . Do that , and you 'll get a lot of respect from a lot of people .
And , the converse is true in the lower latitudes .
What do you mean `` my ultimate agenda '' ? I want regulation of the gun trade as there is regulation of the trade of every product with specific control laws that apply to each product . Does this mean a complete ban ? No . Let 's compare this to a drivers license . Yes I realize that 's not a product , but it is regulated similar to the way guns should be regulated . It varies from state to state , but there is typically a driver 's ed class , driving with an instructor , and a driving test . A person must pass all of these things before recieving a license . A person must also meet other qualifications such as vision requirements . Then , in my state , when a person recieves his or her license , it is only a provisional license , meaning that he or she can not drive between midnight and 5 a.m . This lasts for eighteen months unless there are any moving violations , in which case the period starts over . These are all reasonable restrictions . These ideas can be applied to gun control . There could be gun training and gun tests . Background information such as prior criminal activities should be checked . Guns should not be made available at unregulated events such as gun shows . These sort of regulations are also similar to those on prescription drugs . A person must have a prescription from a real doctor , and he or she can only purchase or pick up the medicine from certified locations . This is clearly not a fringe view since a large number of people support gun control . You may disagree with this view , but it clearly is not a fringe view . Nor is it a sign of mental instability . The constitutionality of gun control is clearly debatable . It 's not exactly simple . You ca n't ignore `` well regulate . '' Even GunCite , a pro gun website , says , `` 'To put in good order ' is the correct interpretation of well regulated , signifying a well disciplined , trained , and functioning militia . '' Disciplining , training . That sounds like controlling . And if it was such a simple constitutional issue , why has n't the Supreme Court made a difinitive ruling on it ? If anything , it has ruled in favor of gun control , saying in the Miller case that `` The Second Amendment must be interpreted and applied with a view to its purpose of rendering effective the Militia . '' Regardless , the constitutionality of a law does not make it wrong or right . Slavery was once allowed under the Constitution , but that did not make it wrong or right .
Indeed . The genetic code sure is interesting . Whatever the explanation for the origins of the code , whether intentional agency , only RV+NS , self-organization or a combination of these , the fact that these processes converged on a single , reasonably optimal code that is able to facilitate evolution makes it look like it was an inevitable result from the system . The system seems to be rigged and biased towards certain outcomes similar to the evolution of life .
I 'm not aware that the police used violence in arresting any of the people discussed in this case . Besides , I 'm not discussing personal morality here , I 'm discussing what should be legal , and what is practical in a society where not everyone shares the same moral views . Government is there to apply limits to what is permitted , based on the will of the people .
What difference does it make ? Do you only care about frequent killings and choose to ignore isolated incidents ? If so does n't that mean that innocent people dying only interests you when it 's in large enough numbers that you can try and exploit them for your own selfish agendas ?
And NOW we find out that Mexico 's overall per capita crime rate is less than countries like the UK , Canada and ours ? Maybe the problem is drugs and NOT the 2nd Amendment !
The 'teachings ' either have no substance , or are certainly not original . Demonstrate categorically just who is the Son of God , and why this figure commands worship and obeisance .
so do you think the Soviets , er -- silly me -- I mean Darwinists , will put 2 + 2 together and proclaim to the world that since one 's environment ( diet , environmental toxins , etc ) can cause disease that one could eliminate/control this disease by eliminating the environmental source that 's causing it ? I think this would explain why cancer is getting to be so wide-spread in society and why younger and younger people are developing it . The cause of disease has nothing to do with the genes themselves ... as Dr. Bruce Lipton says , `` It 's the environment , stupid . '' Of course if this little secret got out ( that people could cure themselves by changing their internal and/or external environments ) then Big medicine , including millions and millions of people would be without a paycheck . We ca n't have that . The sad thing though , as your article indicates , is disease does n't just end with the person who has it ... diseases often get carried forward into future generations , making children ( and their children ) more vulnerable .
A person going to Hell is a consequence of sin . God does n't want it , but he ca n't stop it .
Is that a threat ?
So if it can be operated by means other than human control , are you saying a dog can operate it , maybe a monkey , thats something we see everyday . You are trying to split hairs Penfold , for a gun to be fired weather robotically , or training a primate to fire one still requires human intervention , so stop acting stupid because you are not stupid .
Actually , it is n't .
Prove your assertion that he has called himself a conservative Christian rather than a conservative Republican OP . Support your clai if you can or stop trying to lump everyone on the right together .
And yet you `` and other women '' feel free to impose their version of reality on innocent lives .
Sorry , sometimes sarcasm is quite hard to read .
I agree , women are not child bearing cubicles thats only function in life is to have babys . What trouble 's me is that , if men had to go through what women did in pregnancy , the pro-life movement would be totally non-existant . Men are really not capable of being pro-life without being a hypocryte , as they have not experienced pregnancy . Why that is not true of the pro-choice side , is that we let the women choose , and she can choose both ways if she wishes . The pro-life movement involves force and blatant disregard for rights of the women , to the point of violation , yet the men have almost no knowledge of what it is like to get pregnant or have babies . Many pro-life men do know what raising a child is like , but they do not know what raising a child is like when you are a 14 year old girl with three kids already and no money . Yes , not all abortions go this way , but some do , and thats the point . You do n't know every women 's circumstances , and until you do , you are in no position to force her to abide by your morals , and thus harming her .
So basically you are saying that evolution is the one and only true explanation of how we came to be , and that it is okay for the schools to force students to accept this `` fact '' . That is why they are failing .
Because of the rare nature of fossilisation , we do n't expect to see perfect transitional lineages through millions and millions of years . I really do n't think there are any scientists that think there SHOULD be millions and millions of transitions , because of the nature of fossilisation . Science is like a detective story . If you wanted to solve a murder , for example , you take a look at the evidence . You have a gun , spent rounds , dead body etc . To convict someone of a murder , you need fingerprints , blood on clothes , DNA and such to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person you are accusing actually shot the deceased and you can convict WITHOUT an eye witness . It 's the same for science and the fossil record , because there is no-one around who directly observed animals undertaking large changes over time . But if you take a look at the fossil record , molecular biology , geological time etc , this is what it shows . From what we understand from the last 100 or so years of evidence and investigation , biological evolution is the best scientific explanation we have for the diversity of life on earth . 3 questions for Calligirl . For the 4th time . What would be YOUR definition of a transitional form ? When calculating the age of this earth , how precise do you expect or want scientists to get ? How many transitional fossils would you LIKE to see in what period of time ? I really do n't think this will progress if you ca n't tell us what it is you would like to see .
Read to the very end of the verse . `` If you are not pleased with her , let her go wherever she wishes . You must not sell her or treat her as a slave , since you have dishonored her . ''
So basically , you 're saying you know they have a legal criteria for what constitutes civil rights , and in the same section you say you are n't a lawyer , and that you ca n't track it down . Interesting . Since you are n't backing it up and essentially admit that you ca n't , then your claim will be taken for what little it 's worth .
Ok , now show your evidence . If you have any , that is .
do you have proof of such a statement ? And what does this have to do with writing an article ? What a ridiculous comeback . You do n't know your evolutionary theory .
A little of both . Japan is known for allowing its police officers to physically and mentally torture suspects and deny them legal counsel if they determine that such counsel will interfere with their interrogation . Suspects are n't allowed to read confessions before signing them either . Is that what Penfold really wants ?
Way to make a controversial , unsupported assertion , Winston !
What a crock . I find myself loving when you go on and on so that I can continue to wail on you with the Truth Stick of No Mercy & # 8482 ; . It 's usually you who is responsible for shutting yourself up .
So the argument there seems to be that gun crime has been rising despite the strict gun laws of England . The statistics show both a rise and fall in gun crime : `` In the year ending 31 March 2005 provisional figures show a : `` 16 % reduction in the use of handguns 9 % reduction in robberies involving firearms 6 % reduction in serious injuries from firearms offences Despite these figures , the number of overall offences involving firearms has been increasing each year since 1997/98 . And crime involving imitation weapons was up 55 % in 2004-05 compared to the previous year . ( Source : Crime in England and Wales 2004/2005 ) `` Also of concern is a rise in the number of young people carrying real or imitation firearms in an attempt to boost their image or from a mistaken idea about self-protection . '' http : //www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-v ... ime/gun-crime/ In addition , the rise in gun crime may be mostly due to the big rise in the number of replica and air guns being used in crime : `` Imitation weapons were used in 3,332 offences in 2004/05 , an increase of more than half ( 55 % ) from 2003/04 ... .Ball-bearing ( BB ) guns are easy to purchase and often look like real weapons ... .Anti-firearms campaigners would like to see much tighter controls for all other types of weapons , including an outright ban on the production , sale , and possession of BB guns , airguns , and replica guns ... .The police say that in 2003 replica firearms were used in an estimated 60 % of robberies and four out of five of all firearms offences . Nearly three quarters ( 72 % ) of firearms seized by the Metropolitan Police Service in 2003 under Operation Trident , set up to tackle gun crime within Londons black communities , were replicas , air guns , or starter pistols .

Evolution explains the examples abilities to adapt . Without it , youre in the hole .
Been saying that ever since the first time I heard about creationsism .
Considering your previous comment , that is n't you . Once again , that opinion is based upon who you read .
Here 's what I was recalling :
One reason for conversion is that they do practice many religions . Jesus said He is the only way to God . I believe that , so how can I just turn a blind eye when people follow so many different religions ? I would not be following the commands of my Lord .
As much as it pains me I 'm going to agree with Mathew here . If you own a private business then you should be able to hire and fire people for whatever reason you want . If a private company only wants to employ one gender that should be their choice . If a private company only wanted to employ people choosing a gay lifestyle , I would support their right to do so . I also support a persons right to not use businesses who have hiring practices they do n't agree with . Note : I do n't include gov't in this , the rules are and should be different for government .
Thats not the point . The Pro-lifers advocate force , just like the slave advocates did . The pro-choicers advocate freedom and choice , just like the abolitionists .
Is n't the point pretty obvious- that exposure to a gun can raise testosterone levels and trigger violent and aggressive thoughts and actions ?
I know this is an old posting , but I thought I would add to it . I have built several 1911 clones . Press forge the frame ( and slide , sometimes ) , then mill the parts . I use a CNC mill ( about $ 750,000 ) . A lot fo guys , though , use a $ 300 minimill from harbor freight . A setup for press forging the parts ( press forging is the better modern alternative to drop forging ) will set you back less than $ 200 , if you are a good scrounger . Gun building is probably a more common hobby than you might think . It is hard to tell exactly how many people are doing it , because a homebuilt gun requires no registration , permit to build , or any of that other XXXX ( unless you are building an NFA firearm , which is a machine gun ) . There is even a yahoo group about building your own gun . Fro the faint of heart ( those who do n't want to forge or cast theri own reciver/frame ) there are a bunch of places that will sell you an 80 % finished reciever , which does n't count as a firearm from a legal viewpoint . I always buy my barrels since it is too much work to do the rifling . In a pinch , it could be done , it just would n't be a competition grade barrel . Of course , most firearms you buy do n't come with a stock competition grade barrel .
And yet the US still has a much higher gun crime rate despite having a very high incarceration rate compared to other developed nations with a lot less gun violence . Get a clue .
It 's one of many viable paths , when combined with others , helps us to discover the workings of the physical universe . Unless , I 'm reading this wrong , and your statement means that the `` debate '' about evolution vs. creationism is n't a path for inquiry into the workings of the universe ... In which case , I would suggest that debate is a healthy way to help us all crystallize what we believe , which in turn can lead to greater discovery , indirectly .
It 's not a human being it 's a clump of uninvited cells . If it 's not a parasite ( as you claim ) then it would n't need the woman to survive
For those that argue over the pretense of `` marriage is a religious institution '' , I do n't know why they do n't push SOLELY for what governmental involvement of `` civil unions '' . After all , if the government has a hand in the institution of marriage , it 's not just a `` religious institution '' . Moreover , those fighting against gay marriage are doing so SOLELY in the governmental arena . If a gay couple gets married in their church , that 's entirely legal in 50 states with no attempts to make it illegal . So it kind of undermines the pretense of `` religious '' concerns when people SOLELY try to prevent GOVERNMENTAL recognition of gay unions .
And you believe that to be what ? You really need to just say who/what you think the Creator is to save us from having to make all these clarification posts .
And anyone who thinks this will be seen as an XXXXX and close-minded .
How about this explanation - you 're reading WAAAAAY too much into your precious Bible .
So your only link to gay rights and polygamy is a statement put out by a gay rights conference 30 years ago that does not EXPLAIN a link to polygamy , but shows it 's support for it ? Hn ... I 'm with Justine on this one . This is a bit of a stretch . It would be like me implying that your support for `` traditional marriage '' also supports spousal abuse just because marriages in the past allowed for wife beatings .
NOt true , California 's ammendments are not doing as well as other states did . You are talking about a very liberal state . If it is decided that marriage is allowed by the courts , then you are talking about taking away rights people have been granted by the courts . I just do n't think that will happen in Calf . much too liberal .
To be honest i think that the risks are equal they are no higher in childbirth than they are in termination there are no qaurentees in either .
Which , to my mind , is the more proper way to do things . Having the people decide on legislative matters seems alot like having a commitee of your neighbors decide on the proper way to perform your heart surgery . Too many states make it far too easy to get an issue on the ballot , and alot of very stupid laws and constituional amendments have resulted . Take a look at California politics if you want some examples .
The big unobservable , untestable one .
The AR-15 has over 100 parts in its assembly . Under the language of the Brady II bill , if it had passed , anyone wishing to assemble their own AR-15 would be required to acquire an arsenal license just for one gun . A notice to all supporters of gun control : We 're no longer compromising , we 're not the ones who have to . From now on it 's up to you to justify , in an intelligent and sophisticated manner , exactly how your proposals qualify as `` reasonable '' and `` common sense '' and how they `` do n't infringe on the Second Amendment '' .
Science pigeonholes God into a constrictive box , not me . Where have I ever attributed to God a limitation ? You 're getting as bad as your helper OC .
Ah.. hehe . That makes more sense Allthough i sincerely doubt that atheism as in `` rejection of the existance of god ( s ) '' is a modern invention . Allthough I guess that it is becoming more widespread than it has been in several thousands of years ...
Man , these guys ca n't even get into the science before they 're outright lying ...
Well read this link , http : //www.realwomenca.com/newslette ... article_1.html Why take my word for it when you can read it for yourself from professionals , professors , mental health studies , etc . This link also disclaims the links you have listed . Finding flaws in their studies . So thats my source , and thats my stand .
Not really . If someone posts an article without a disclaimer , do you think that they do n't support that article 's findings ?
Oh no an open minded church that does n't hate ? GASP ! And sorry but the bible has many interpretations as is clearly seen in the WIDE and VAST amount of differing denominations . Just because their not closes binded right wing bigots does n't mean you can grill them cause their interpretation is different ...
It has n't been proven that the Second Amendment is solely about tyrannical governments and not about dealing with violent criminals .
And as I said , Herbert Spencer 's ideas predate Darwin 's . Meanwhile , Dawkins writings on religion are irrelevant to whether evolution is good biology .
Thanks , my friend , as you can see , Jito completely ignored the substance of my argument as it applies to the current american culture , as she responded to how it would apply to her personal life 's credo . A more dishonest way of avoiding the meat of my argument could n't be formed except by a manipulative , insincere and philosophical coward of jitobear 's caliber . That 's why there 's nothing she wrote that 's worth responding to . As usual she has n't actually responded to anything I said . Why must these leftists twist what we say as they ignore the actual substance of it ?
Thanks ! There 's a petrified forest in Mississippi also . I do n't know how long it took to produce the petrification and expose the pieces , but I 'll find out next trip . I 'm curious how the YECs could use this in an argument since the process described could hardly occur in nature . Are they going to argue that all the petrified woods could have been formed within the 6000 year life of the earth ? Likely , the use of argon was simply to preclude the presence of oxygen . Other inert gases could have done the same .
And what is an inheritance ? Proverbs 13:13 he who feareth the commandment shall be rewarded . 14 The law of the wise is a fountain of life . 15 Good understanding giveth favor 16 Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge 17 a faithful ambassador is health 18 but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured . 19 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul 20 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise 21 but to the righteous good shall be paid . What inheritance should a good man leave to his children 's children ? Solomon was n't talking of money , but of God 's law . In Solomon 's view , the wicked can have their money , the true reward goes to the righteous . Why this should contrast with selling your luxuries and giving to the poor I 'm not sure .
What do you want to bet that the cops in that town are still encouraged to pursue murder suspects ?
What do you mean by this ? Could we not have the law treat under-18 capital offenders on an individual basis , determining whether the individual offenders in the individual cases were sufficiently developed ? Also , what would you say to the response that our current law provides that juveniles are sufficiently developed enough to have the responsibility , without parental involvement , to decide whether to obtain an abortion ? Is it not a conflict to say juveniles should not be eligible for the death penalty because they are not morally developed enough , but at the same time say juveniles are morally developed enough to decide whether to obtain an abortion without involving their parents ?
No , this is more of an ethical stand point . A fetus is incapable of feeling outraged or offended by being aborted then why is it an outrage by others to begin with ? The only party that stakes out a vital rule in condemning abortion is the fetus ... and unfortunately for that minority the fetus is a neutral party . However clinical signs of life do define us as a living person . Not conception . So no living people is being aborted ... at least in the majority of abortion cases .
I do n't think people like you are prepared for it , but I 'm not prepared to put up with people like you , and I get by somehow . Would it be good for society ? What society ? What are you talking about ?
Actually , there is no evidence to support creationism , which is based on the mythology of bronze age , nomadic herdsmen . Thus , the creationism v. evolution debate becomes an effort by creationists to discredit evolution rather than an effort to offer evidence for creationism . The reason is simple - there is no evidence that supports creationism . On the other hand , it is intentional ignorance to claim that the earth is only 6,000 years old , that there was a universal flood about 4500 years ago , or that the millions of species in the world today evolved from a few thousand species at most at rates no evolutionary biologist would even consider possible . Creationists deny evolution and then offer hyperevolution when they realize that their position is impossible .
I accept your apology with appreciation . I am sorry if I jumped the gun . Perhaps I am too suspicious . I will adjust my attitude .
So reading and literature are n't to be taught ? I love it . More stupid , paranoid parents for me to mock mock mock . They are sooo part of a great big problem . A problem that sees my kid getting threatened and bullied - so I feel totally justified in my mocking . Frankly , there are days I would like to kick them in the teeth .
And the answer is : we do n't know . Maybe it came from nowhere . Maybe it was created . We do n't know .
Translation : `` Shut up , I 'm right ! ''
I do n't get why either side thinks it matters much . There is evidence that many , many behaviors we see have genetic roots ; including behaviors that are unacceptable to society . It is not like something being genetic necessarily matters one iota in terms of the morality the behavior associated with it . So it 's just as strange that some feel proving gay-is-genetic will matter as it is strange that some feel that disproving it will matter . The moral issue of homosexual relations will go on regardless of the genetic debate , because quite frankly , one is not dependent on the other .
And what would make them separate species ? How about wolves and dogs , separate species ? How about Great Danes and Chihuahuas ? They can not interbreed under any circumstances ( even artificially - the fetus is n't viable ) .
Yea an explanation would be nice ... ..I do n't know that I 've had anything deleted on here before -- ( it could have happened without me knowing it ) -- but I have no idea why that was deleted . If there was something specific I said , the post should have been snipped , not deleted altogether .
This decision was not solely based on self , but then , I really do n't give a if you want to call me selfish - the facts speak for themselves .
BREAKING NEWS : SHOOTING IN DALLAS OFFICE TOWER - CTnow Ah , the good old gun-crazy US of A .
F -- k'in A ! right ! I do n't want some damn MAN deciding what 's going to be legal for my body . They have NO experience with the female anatomy except what they manage to bag , they should n't be allowed to decide for us . They have no idea what pregnancy is like , the damage it does to our bodies and our minds , and they do n't have to pay to support a child that we were forced to accept at knifepoint . Where is the logic is violating women a second time ? Where 's the justification for it ? Does n't the life of the unintended mother account for anything at all ? Do you men have any idea of the dangerous precdent you 'd be setting up with a total ban on abortion ? Women who have been raped and essentially told `` You WILL have this child , you WILL carry it to term , or you WILL go to prison ! '' would likely commit suicide as a result , meaning that TWO lives are gon na be lost .
Perhaps this throws light on the question of whether T.rex was warm-bloodied or cold-bloodied . The possibility ( if confirmed ) of a feathered T.rex seems to indicate that they were warm-bloodied creatures that required insulation in a cool climate ? ? ?
So what generates morphology ?
A perfect example of why Christian fundamentalismm and evolution ca n't co-exist . If God is wrong , then the Bible is wrong . Evolution contradicts the Bible , plain and simple .
It 's a lot more than what you 've come up with . What evidence do you have that indicates the Iraq population was n't heavily armed ? As for the Taliban , you 're confusing Afghanistan with Iraq .
http : //www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/he ... 4hospital.html But a fetus in the womb is far more important than the lives and health of these women .
But creation is n't a theory and it 's definitely not science . And science is n't based on assumptions and extrapolations . Perhaps you should take a science course . Science is based on observation , hypothesis , prediction , and testing .
Before saying more , I 'd just like to comment on the polite tone of your contribution - free from the asperities that often entertain but seldom enlighten these debates . Now I must ask you to furnish reasons for your claim that `` evolution is a theory that has disguised itself as science '' .
** This is the best response you 've got ! ? ! What a loser ! !
That 's your argument ? `` Just surrender your guns now , you can still get them illegally later on ? '' That 's the dumbest argument I 've heard yet since Galileo 's argument of `` Just go ahead and register your guns now , if the police want them they 'll confiscate them whether they 're registered or not . '' Also , in this sentence you just admitted that gun bans are useless . You said that people could easily acquire bans after they were banned . So you 're admitting what Great Britain did was a useless tactic that ca n't have any beneficial results .
No , that example dealt with how goverment should deal with it . Does the ocean abide to your right to life as you drown ? Does the avalanche abide to your right to liberty as you are trapped ? Does the pack of hyenas abide to your right to property as they rob you of food ? An inalienable right can only be removed by God . Therefore everything BUT God must respect and abide to it . How can a right that is clearly not abided to be inalienable ?
What makes heteros think they have that right ?
Most doctors will not perform an abortion this late without threat to the mother .
It does n't matter whether it is religous or not . The odds of anyboy being fired over such a thing are slim to none . Morning after pills can not possibly make up eough of any given pharmacys revenue to make it worth the expense of replacing a skilled employee .
Someone who does evil things is n't simply not doing good things , he is specifically doing evil . Evil is not the absence of good .
So , what is the current treatment and how effective is it ? Obviously it is more COST effective . We dont know what the current treatment is , or how effective it is , because what you posted here is a one sided opinion piece masquerading as a news article , and you ate it up .
And you think that killing your baby does n't cause any emotional and/or physical pain ?
Unfortunately , Michael Moore is a XXXXX . While a thousand gun control laws could n't prevent 9-11 , if there were n't ANY gun control laws , 9-11 would surely have been preventable . But , Michael Moore , being a XXXXX , would never be able to draw such a logical conclusion . It is n't `` liberal '' enough for his tastes .
But what are you aborting ? You ca n't abort something that has n't started yet . Simply not allowing yourself to become pregnant by whatever means ( abstinence , condoms , pills etc . ) ends in the same result , you not becoming pregnant . Not allowing an unwanted fertilized egg to implant into your womb is hardly an abortion or `` murder '' .
Most of them happening in the inner cities of Illinois , New York and California - states where the restricted access of firearms is supposedly designed to keep acts like these from happening . Who 's the real traitor in this case ; Obama for not passing your gun control package ? Or the black guys that feel the need to kill their fellow black men for whatever reason motivates them ?
The dead ones ca n't , and things like Cystic Fibrosis or Severe Combined Immunodeficiency are going to kill you easily before you reach sexual maturity without medical care . Genetic disease - kills people - dead people do n't have babies The rest of natural selection fits in as lesser versions of that , healthy animals have more children and more of those survive . Hungry and unhealthy ones are going to have fewer , and likely fewer healthy ones . The cycle continues .
So what ? Why should the woman be forced to care for this child against her will ?
Actually , we have a pretty good idea of how life populates islands . And yes , it is pretty much by chance that things get carried to islands by any of several means . Your question/statement about two things happening exactly the same way does n't seem to make sense .
Sure you do n't want to visit RI in Sept .
Why do n't you point out exactly where I said anything about a `` die-hard Christian '' ? ? ? ? ? ? Creationism has nothing to to with Christianity , and it 's proponents tend to be some of the worst representatives .
My point in starting the thread is not merely that Christians fall short of their aspirations . No ... .this is worse . Because this particular U.S . Senator , an avowed conservative Christian , has actively worked to restrict the rights of others to marry , supposedly in the name of `` protecting '' or `` defending '' marriage , while at the same time undermining his own marriage . He makes a pretense , for political gain I suspect , of `` defending marriage '' by playing to people 's anti-gay prejudices while himself undermining marriage in his real life . That 's hypocrisy , and it 's dishonesty .
Come on , now . You 're talking about a city where the dead vote in every election .
And that would make you the one that IS advocating the murder of our future generation .
I would like to hear a viable reason why they should be registered . The Canadian system has shown us it is money badly spent . It 's completely useless . I really does nothing to solve crime because for the most part , law abiding citizens would be the only ones registering their firearms .
Once again the enemies of freedom have backhandedly slipped under the radar with nonsensical gun legislation designed to make criminals out of law abiding citizens ... To obey the law is to break the law ... .
Ahh , another , not of this country trying to stir the pot . At least you are honest and portend to know little of what our Constitution is or does as for it 's role in American government .
The lutheran ceremony is pretty cool just change a few words to gender nutral . Also the Cathedral of hope http : //www.cathedralofhope.com in dallas and the MCC in general has some very nice Holy union ceremonies
Quote Mining . You got to love it . Always fascinating when stuff is dishonestly taken out of context . Normally , we see this from creationists , but you are by no means the first prolifer who has engaged in this practice . But lets look at it
I think that if Montalban is anything , he is opportunistic . Someone ( Ungerdunn I think ) pointed out to him that the phrase , `` survival of the fittest '' reduces to a tautology . As seems to be his bent , Montalban generalized that fact to claim that somehow evolution is a tautology . As I mentioned in a previous post , without further criterion , `` survival of the fittest '' is a tautology . But Darwin did offer further criterion in chapter after chapter years before he acquiesced to use the phrase . Certainly Montalban has read `` Origin '' since he quotes it . How is it that he missed chapter 2 ? How is it that he failed to understand Darwin 's meaning in chapter 1 ? But I will concede that `` Origin '' is not an easy read . Understanding requires a command of English beyond the ordinary , as well as an understanding of biological science at a graduate level . Darwin was not addressing a popular audience , even though his book became popular . Darwin was addressing the naturalist of his day - what came to be called biologists in our day . English grammar and usage has evolved since Darwin 's day and biology has advanced . When one considers the importance to evolutionary theory of what Darwin said ( even without the misunderstandings of the uneducated ) , it is a matter of historical significance only . Darwin 's theories have been supported or falsified many times over . For the most part , his theories have been supported . He was wrong on some minor points . Essentially , a quote from Darwin without reference to some meaningful publication since is quite meaningless .
So taking peoples rights away is an american value ? I think I will push for legislation to make cancer surgery illegal . After all cancer cells are human life too and with modern medical tech they could become a human being also .
One point I would like to make is that rockets are not legal to own , unless they are demil-ed , and the same goes for tanks and aircraft . They are called Destructive Devices under the NFA , and are regulated heavily .
So religion must be systematically abandoned and eradicated , not completely , just enough to be out of the public and political realm , leaving atheism as king . Its not my pet theory that evolutionists are saying that , its a fact that they are saying that .
Really ? Prove it with absolutely undeniable evidence which cosmologists will defend as irrefutable , if you can . Now let the excuses fly as you admit that nothing in science is absolute , that all we can do is make observations and extrapolate possible outcomes from them until new observations arise which either confirm or refute those previously accepted observations .
This is obviously incorrect since Earth and Mars are were created only 6,000 years ago . And how did they know that Mars would be so close this year ? I have other questions too . How do they know that Pluto has a 249 year orbit of the sun since it was n't discovered until 1930 . No one has seen it orbit the sun yet . How did they know that it would actually come closer to the sun than Neptune in 1979 and move forther away again in 1999 ? They told me that when I was young . But no one had ever seen it . It was just speculation - a scientific theory , right ? ?
Excellent observation ! ( and , for the record ... I actually agree that man 's impact upon the planet has had some affect on global temperatures ... . I just do n't agree that we have a crisis to deal with as a consequence )
Actually , according to your use of the word `` person , '' she is . A significant percentage of fertilized eggs fail to implant and are instead passed . How sad ( and typical ) that you have n't bothered to educate yourself about these things .
No one really dragged anyone , marc . I was doing what is called `` making a joke . '' You need a sense of humor to understand this . The idea behind the humor was that it seems that in 2008 any person or institution that does not understand that evolution is a fact is indeed backward in their thinking . In that they finally recognized a commonly accepted fact so late , it would seem they were hitherto reluctant . Hence the `` kicking and screaming '' reference . Sheesh , if you have to explain it ...
Yeah , yeah we can all do math . Why do you even bother ? You said statistics is just a game . -VOR Take it seriously .
Oh but you forgot the rest of my secret plan . Just like Hitler , first you take the guns , then you send them to 'jail ' . A jail with 'showers ' and 'ovens ' . The most important part of the plan is make sure anti-gunners do n't have guns . Which ofcourse is not a problem .
LOL ! By that logic children entering a school with substandard English skills are just as much a threat to others as armed children entering a school with no training in firearms .
I 'm new to this idea that science has over-ruled Creation . Please explain .
In a situation where you have to pick who dies there is no winner . You default to some standard which can be the highest chance of living ( save the life you can ) . Lucky this rarely happens ... if ever ( normally both will die in this kind of scenario ) .
Yes they have . Are you denying that conservatives and religious-right advocates have not been trying to ban gay marrige ?
Penfold beat me to it .
Well , a pretty complex sort of machine , not at all like the kind ( so far ) intelligently designed by humans . And even if we do in the future invent machines that mimic life , that 's all they 'd be : mimics .
Well let 's deal with one thing at a time . The NEJM study about Washington D.C. concluded that banning handguns saved 47 lives each year . The study did n't conclude that it was just a `` curious relationship in the numbers . '' Go back to that thread and read the study . If you 're looking for evidence that is absolutely without any degree of uncertainty then you wo n't find it . You ca n't prove things to a 100 % certainty with statistics . What you can do is show what is probably true and what is probably not true . Even in court you 're not expected to prove that someone is guilty to a 100 % certainty . You 're expected to prove that they are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt .
Well , I DUNNO ? ! ? ! Did god do it ! ? ! ? ? ! ? ! Of course dinosaurs exist . There are fossils proved to be millions of years old , by real scientists . Why is it so hard for you to accept the way the universe was made ? Why are you so afraid of logic ?
That seems unlikely . He gets banned everywhere he goes with his multiple names . He 's not very good at hiding his identity and not very good at controlling his temper when dealing with the sort of creation believing XXXXXX that you get frequenting these boards ( I ca n't say I blame him on the latter point ) . Look around the web though and you will find him elsewhere ...
So given that there are cases where both dies ... we just have to give up the mother 's right to live over a fetus ( which will die ) ? What if the mother is n't physically ready to have a baby . In the case of a young female ( I 'm talking age of 9 and younger , cause there are cases of young kids having their periods ) being raped , does n't she a `` baby '' ( and I say baby , because she is still at an age where a parent would consider her their youngin ) ... have the right to live ? For me , if I knew my child was raped and is in no way ready for a child of her own , physically or mentally ... I would rather her not risk her life to try and bring that fetus into the world . Abortion should be pro-choice .
If God transported them then there is nothing to discuss because then all evidence is out the window . If it was supernatural , he could have also created everything 5 minutes ago with intact memories .
Not too bad so far , if we overlook the word arrangement of a 13 year old valley girl , spoken in the voice of a gay 21 year old college student . So far I 'm fooled , but suspicious . Moving on ;
The woman drinks fruit juice and the baby moves like crazy . This is a dancer in the womb ...
a deity with all this power , yet not necessarily credited with the creation of the universe ( or any other task suitable for an all-powerful , all-knowing God ) ? so what has this God done for us to assume he has any power at all ?
I see , when you say `` I 'm not an expert '' do you mean you are n't a climate scientist or do you mean you do n't have the scientific knowledge to discuss this ?
Though I am jumping into the discussion here and have not followed it from the beginning , I need to address yours points . I get the impression that you view women as having a responsibility over their offspring from the point of conception on - i.e . not only in late term . I would contest this . Up to around the beginning of the third trimester , the embryo / fetus is nothing but a developing body with `` nobody home '' - i.e . no mental existence ( no thoughts , no emotions , no sense of self , no feelings of pain , no ability to experience their environment - nothing ) . I do not see any reason to have forced responsibility over such a living mindless body . As at the end of life when the mind can be gone from accident or illness , it is not worth keeping the empty living body artificially alive . It is the person who effectively resides in the body ( through mental brain function or belief in a soul ) who we value - not the body itself . From discussions with those on the pro-life side , it seems clear that the thing that is valued in the embryo / early fetus is not as much what it currently IS but what it WILL BECOME . What it currently IS is only valued because it is on its way to becoming something / someone that we do value . The hypothetical question to test this was how much is such a life valued if it suddenly stopped growing so that it would never reach the stage of lifeform that has emotions , thoughts , feelings of pain , etc . Apparently , its value dropped significantly ( at least that was the answer for those not afraid of anwering that question ) . However , once there is `` somebody home '' in that body , then I would agree that you now have another person whose rights should be taken into account . Biologically , neurologically speaking , such mental functions ca n't start before around the beginning of the third trimester . So , I support more clearly legally restricting third trimester abortion rights to the limited exceptions ( mother 's life , significant risk to health , mercy killing deformed fetuses , etc . ) . Then it makes sense to speak of an `` other '' to whom one has responsibilities . One last point . I have heard a few pro-life advocates make the same arguement you do that pro-choice supporters make their arguements simply out of a `` defense rationalization '' , where you think they really do agree that they are doing wrong . You do n't realize that they actually generally do believe all of what they say . As a general rule of thumb , I tend to think that most people believe what they say . However , many people have holes or inconsistencies in their thinking that one can highlight if one can tell what those holes or inconsistencies are . I have found that the best way to discover such holes and inconsistencies in reasoning is to see what type of questions people make an effort at avoiding to answer . Where the pro-life camp is concerned , I find that a major hole in their reasoning is to highlight what the embryo / early fetus is AT THAT MOMENT , independent of what it will become in the future . This has highlighted that it is only valued by what it WILL BECOME , not for what it currently IS . As for the extreme pro-choice side that would allow abortions at all times for any reason ( note : they represent a minority of the pro-choice side ) , then they get very uncomfortable when you question them about the difference in a fetus one day from birth vs a newborn baby and force them to answer the question of whether or not they would allow a birth-minus-one-day abortion for any reason . So , instead of jumping to wrong assumptions about the reasoning of pro-choice supporters , search for holes in logic and reasoning that you can exploit . That would be far more effective than your false assumptions that they are harboring guilt .
Oh , dear . I seem to have lost you again . 'Peer ' just means a group of people holding the same biases .
Iuris , there is something , I want to say something Zenlike in this statement -- but I am not sure .
So-called `` Partial Birth '' Abortions are so rare as to be negligible . This ban was just a small step onto taking away a woman 's right to choice . If it were a `` born baby '' then they would n't have to perform the abortion . It would be able to survive in a respirator . There you go again misusing a legal term . You are the sick one for using emotional arguements and ignoring the facts .
Actually , the only people who I hear talk about `` sub-human '' are creationists . There is the possibility that certain Australian fossils may have descended from H. erectus fossils from Indonesia . And why would a fossil make an `` evolutionist '' nervous ? The idea is really , really dumb .
That is a non sequitur .
Actually it 's all men .
I see . So what you are saying is that you are unsure about evolution and wish to explore it . Great . Then start with one of those unreasonable and dumb arguments and present it . Why are you more reasonable and not so dumb ? It 's easy to do what you have done . I can claim that invisible pink unicorns push the moon across the sky . I can claim that you are unreasonable and dumb because you disagree with me . But it is meaningless unless I am willing to show that I have a pair and can step up and show why I am right . Do you have a pair ?
I believe the current number is around 24,000 for those three groups . But anyways , if the ark only took kinds , rather than species , then that 's an awful lot of speciation occuring very rapidly .
I 've asked this question and many others you may see me post , in a number of other forums . I 've recieved similar arguments , about a country not deciding to invade us . No Particular country was ever mentioned , However , if possible , I would like to belatedly clarify that I am asking this question in the context of the time we are now living in , as opposed to any other time . ( I 'm not sure if I made that at all clear in the post that started the thread . ) ( I take it that this question has been asked before in this forum , rather recently , I assume ? ? ? If not in an initial thread post , then perhaps within another thread . )
You gather information from other forums , then use it as bait on yet another forum ? Exactly how many forums do you belong to ? I would hope you would n't be too surprised that others sometimes ignore you . Is this your main activity in life ?
Whatever , people lying by saying that they lost their jobs because they said they believe in Intelligent Design ? Good ? Bad ? Utterly predictable ? http : //www.expelledexposed.com/index.php/the-truth

Actually , I 'm not looking for shootouts at all with the criminal element . But what is crazy in my opinion , is admitting that there are holes in the system that allow criminals to get automatic weapons illegally , and you see the solution as banning automatic weapons from being purchased by law abiding citizens rather than screaming for the holes in the system to be fixed so the criminals ca n't get them . It seems to me that you have an anti-gun agenda and will use any flaw in the system as an excuse to ban all guns for all people . Is that a fair assessment of where you stand ?
hi Chris in FLA , GOOD point ! However , I take exception with claim that things that are NOT proven ARE true . If I claim that you are being dishonest , but provide no proof , does that mean that my claim is true ? regards , Pete
I did n't mention evolution in this topic . You did .
I do n't believe that . Give me some proof . Besides , one does not have to smoke marijuana to get high .
Well , either the real or imaginary Phyllis implied those things in the post under discussion .
Carla 's silence is deafening .
So much for being on the ignore list ! Unfortunately for the religious Darwin-deniers , the reason red blood cells survive without genes is that genes have programmed them to do it . They are dead-end machines , essentially limited lifetime bags of haemoglobin with some basic metabolism , forever incapable of replicating , and serving their genome by remote control . Most cells , however , depend on their genome to maintain the expression of the proteins they need to survive and function . Species evolve because the sequence and organisation of genes evolves . It does n't take a vast amount of genetic change to evolve one species from another , but it does take genetic change , and molecular geneticists are currently mapping the sort of changes needed to alter rates and timing of gene expression . I realise inveterate Darwin-deniers are n't intellectually capable of understanding molecular genetics , but the evidence for this view is rock solid .
Well , I suppose creationists would object to careful definition of terms and the assiduous distinguishing of fact from non-fact , would n't they ? It runs counter to all they hold dear .
YES , of course , they could not actually hunt , since that would be illegal , possibly a felony , whihc could lead to forfeiture of your rights .
Under interracial marriage , no black person was prohibited from marrying either . Should people have been satisfied with interracial couples being classified as `` civil unions '' ? Today , we recognize that racism is wrong . Yet some people still persist with homophobia . They fail to have a historical context on the real meaning of the methodology they recommend .
Actually Montalban , there is a federal ordinance requiring protestors to stay at least thirty feet from the clinic 's property . Were they allowed to go inside and talk to the women ? Of course not . Most of the rabid anti-abortionists , ( the ones that show up outside the clinic with their disgusting signs and propaganda , shrieking at the women , throwing rotten fruit and worse at them ) have absolutely no right to speak to these women , as their contact with them could be at the least disturbing and at the worst violent and dangerous . Thankful though I am for the ordinance , it is not enough , and in some cases , it is not enforced . There are cases of the police `` looking the other way '' because they agree with the protestors . In my opinion , these protestors should be arrested and prosecuted for harassment , assault , unlawful assembly , and anything else we can pin on them . Yes , in america the first ammendment gives you the right to peaceful assembly and protest , and that right should be protected . But with any other protest , the organisers have to get the proper permits , and police have to be on hand in case anything gets unruly . The protests that occur outside a clinic are neither lawful , nor peaceful .
Really ? Have you ever heard of population genetics ? Do you know what Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is ? Do you actually think that you are so bright that you have insight that generations of biologists and mathematicians do n't . Population genetics is exactly the calculations of how mutatiions spread through populations .
No need . I 'm not exactly a rocket scientist myself .
And who is the 'WE ' that we trust ? The scientists or the theologians , who disagree with each other ? I am curious for it on my own account.. and not willing just to accept someone 's authority saying it happened one way or another .
Of course they did n't see it walk , it 's a different genus altogether .
Note that at the very beginning it said `` allegations '' , as in alleged . Alleged is n't the same thing as hard and provable evidence . So this is nothing more than supposition , theory , hearsay , musings , etc . Come back when you 've got some hard evidence !
Please explain to me how radiometric dating is based on the presupposition that there is no God . You 're telling me that if there was/is a God the results of radiometric dating change ? Abiogenesis is not scientific theory , and for good reason . Like you said it just has no evidence . That 's why it is considered a hypothesis . It is one of many including creation , which was taught in my public high school . I have no problem with this , but the problem becomes when it is taught as a fact or as a valid alternative to evolution . As long as the truth is taught , that there is really no proof for either abiogenesis or creation , I 'm fine . But this debate is whether or not Intelligent Design should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution .
OH ! And I just finished breakfast ... Can anyone say , `` Fly By ! ''
If transitional species is a large issue to overcome , I will post my rather lengthy explanation of the lack of transitional species , but perhaps it should suffice to say that we have found some evidence of transitional species , and even if we had not , the lack of transitional species provides no evidence of creationism .
Actually , it has . The last time I checked , well still have gay marriages in Massachusetts . As a matter of fact , it seems that it is difficult for most politicians to be elcted in the state without being supportive of marriage equality .
Oh really ... biology : a branch of knowledge that deals with living organisms and vital processes I do n't see the synonym `` evolution '' anywhere in that definition . Some biologists may study evolution , but biology is NOT evolution .
So did you read his mind to determine exactly why he bolded that particular set of words ? You are the first mind reader I have encountered here . And considering your disdain and rejection of science from cosmology to biology what does it matter if something is terrible science . According to you all science should be terrible . Why do you attempt to use a tool which you reject as being useful ?
You mean that hole that has been observed and proven , repeatedly ? Climate Change is a controversy in the same way as the earth being broadly spherical is a controversy . There 's a group of nutters who think the earth is flat ; does n't mean there is any reason to believe it is .
So you 're saying that the ones who 're eligible to carry a gun , those who 're 21 or older , never been convicted of a crime , undergo fingerprinting , pay hundreds of dollars , attend an eight hour course held by the police , pass a firearms safety class , and weight three months to finally get their permit , would intentionally use it as an excuse to murder a teacher over a trivial matter like an unfavorable grade ? Would n't it just be easier , as well as more likely , for an emotionally disturbed student to just illegally bring a gun to school and kill their teacher , rather than waiting for a legal alternative to commit murder and go to prison anyway ?

As I pointed out , you do n't understand what either evolution or natural selection are . Evolution is a change in the relative frequencies in inheritable characteristics in a population over generations . If the number of long haired animals became more frequent in the population , then evolution has occurred . Natural selection may ( or may not ) be the mechanism that caused the change .
No need to infer diddly . They asked people what they wanted and socialized medicine was n't it .

First off , I think NATO had a pretty good point . What makes you think that every person shot was a pure victim ? Second , is that why crime rates have gone down in DC after Heller vs DC and why they went down after Florida Shall Issue laws were reinstated ? I 'm guessing thats also why New York City and Chicago have such low crime rates , right ?

Actually , there 's no question .
So , you consider a so called theory which allows a 10 billion year gap out of an alleged potential 10 to 20 billion year age for the occurrence to be the most credible theory ? And is actually supported by evidence ? If they have any evidence , why the 10 billion year gap for wiggle room ? No wonder you accept evolution as a rational possibility . The fact is , they have no credible evidence at all as the big bang is nothing more than a deduction based on theoretical mathematical equations which can neither be confirmed or verified . Just read the link and consider the factors cosmologists must consider before even doing the math required to come up with an age . Now consider how skewed the outcome must be if they are incorrectly interpreting even one aspect of the info they are relying on for the equations which result in an age . Any errors in those results and the out equations are useless . Thus , the 10 billion year gap in their cosmological guessing game . How Old is the Universe ? Now consider the creator of the big bang theory itself . Edwin Hubble proposed the big bang as a possible beginning of the Universe based on the perceived expansion of the universe from a tiny central singularity back in 1929 . Since then it has become the holy grail of the scientific community in explaining how Time and Space began . http : //www.umich.edu/~gs265/bigbang.htm This theory is made up of nothing more than the imaginings of a young cosmologist back in 1929 yet has been adopted as a rational theory by the scientific community as if they are a bunch of lemmings who will grasp at any explanation which does n't claim that God did it .
No , that is just sin in general
There are those people out there who are very educated and believe that it is rediculous that greenhouse gases are causing the increase in tempurature right now . It can be shown that the world was cooler 4000 years ago and that in itself indicates that there is some sort of cycle the Earth 's tempurature goes through over time . So there is evidence that the increase in temp is based on a natural cycle and not greenhouse gases . I do n't particularly know if it is true or not but it is something to consider .

You throw personal insults more than I do . So when will YOU grow up ?
Well , it was n't just a footnote that Lott supposedly lost . It was all his raw data to support his claim that 98 % of defensive gun uses do n't involve the firing of the weapon . And Lott did lie because changed his story about who conducted the story . `` When Lott cited the statistic peripherally on page three of his book , he attributed it to 'national surveys . ' In the second edition , he changed the citation to 'a national survey that I conducted . ' He has also incorrectly attributed the figure to newspaper polls and Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck . '' http : //www.townhall.com/columnists/m ... 20030205.shtml So was it a newspaper poll ? Did Kleck conduct it ? Now Lott claims he did it . If true , he must have been lying when he said that others conducted the study . `` He has forgotten the names of the students who allegedly helped with the survey and who supposedly dialed thousands of survey respondents long-distance from their own dorm rooms using survey software Lott ca n't identify or produce . '' Interesting how he ca n't remember anyone who helped him . `` Lott now admits he used a fake persona , 'Mary Rosh , ' to post voluminous defenses of his work over the Internet . 'Rosh ' gushed that Lott was 'the best professor that I ever had . ' She/he also penned an effusive review of 'More Guns , Less Crime ' on Amazon.com : `` It was very interesting reading and Lott writes very well . '' ( Lott claims that one of his sons posted the review in 'Rosh 's ' name . ) Just last week , 'Rosh ' complained on a blog comment board : `` Critics such as Lambert and Lindgren ought to slink away and hide . '' `` By itself , there is nothing wrong with using a pseudonym . But Lott 's invention of Mary Rosh to praise his own research and blast other scholars is beyond creepy . And it shows his extensive willingness to deceive to protect and promote his work . '' http : //www.townhall.com/columnists/m ... 20030205.shtml
Bad guy vs bad guy is included to be sure but remember , 43 % of the people in the study had no criminal record .
Oh I understand plenty . What you want is a system where a person is held responsible for crimes that they did n't commit . You want `` guilty by association '' extended to the point of ridiculousness where anybody who even met the criminal even once can be held as an accomplice .
that 's right , i do n't want ANOTHER parental figure to tell me what to do , when to do it , and how to do it .
Have you lost your mind ? I got no idea what you are talking about .
Besides asking what you mean by `` proof '' and what `` proof '' will be acceptable , I would also like to know what you mean by transitional . I can actually do better than show you a transitional fossil . I 'll show you a living transitional between two species . Go to almost any body of water in northern North America in the summer , or along the coasts of southern North America in the winter and look for birds like this . http : //www.martinreid.com/Image % 20files/HEGU18B.jpg There you go . The American herring gull ( Larus argentatus smithsonianus ) A transitional between two species . These birds range to the east across Greenland , Iceland , and into northern Europe . It looks about the same in Europe . http : //www.birdguides.com/html/vidli ... 015a001_j2.jpg They also range to the west from Alaska into Siberia , across Siberia and Russia all the way to northern Europe . But as you go further and further west their appearance begins to change . But there is never a place where neighboring populations can not and do not interbreed . But in northern Europe the populations from the west look a bit different . http : //www.birdguides.com/html/vidli ... 018a001_j2.jpg That 's the Lesser black-backed gull ( L. fuscus ) . Even though it shares the same range as the herring gull it does not interbreed with herring gulls . So here is one large population that has become two different species at the extremes of its range , and those extremes overlap . So the American herring gull is a transitional between the Herring gull and the Lesser black-backed gull . It is even thought that the original population from which all of these birds descended lived in North America .
Old habits die hard and dogs do n't pay attention to clocks !
The deceived one is you Brady . How many of those alleged lives taken by gun violence were police shootings ? How many by gang memebrs killing other gang members ? Where did you come up with your figures Brady , VPC your namesake group ? They are thoroughly discredited as you should realize by now . How many are suicides ? The prevention models for these are different in case you were unaware . You fail to even consider how many of those lives were taken by criminals in the commission of a crime . Yet you would render us helpless to them in your quest for a non hostile working environment . Show exactly where in the constitution and Bill of Rights the wording for gun control . Here is a clue , they are n't there . If you were truely concerned about loss of innocent life then you would be supporting laws to keep the violent criminal away from society . Instead they are free after many arrests and convictions to prey upon a society that you would render helpless . Why Brady ?
Actually , they do n't . I have never heard a biologist talking about `` mutations creating information '' .

How the hell can you narrow it down to three ? The competition in the entire top ten is fierce .
Gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in .
I understand that the position is commonly called `` Pro-life . '' However , pro-life should not just concern abortion . Pro-life should be about safe sex , peace , stem cell research , exercise , healthy eating and pollution control . As of yet , I 've never seen a Pro-life rally against obesity -- which kills more than any abortion clinic . It truly is `` Anti-Abortion '' and some can argue that it is `` Anti-Choice . '' The reason it 's not call anti-anything is because the prefix `` anti '' implies a negative , and all of our connotations make it a bad thing . No one wants to be anti-choice . And seriously , other than people who directly profit from it , who is `` pro-death ? '' As for the original post , it seems that story is more about some African women not knowing how to deliver babies , or prevent them .
And as their populations grew over thousands of years , civilizations seperate out and independent nations form , laws are set up , and some prosper while others wallow in poverty , how long do you think it will take until people begin to kill each other on your peaceful planets ? Nice dream , but real life does not work like that .
hmm . really , I think it is . and so does the pope .
Again , if it were only that simple . I do n't have the `` obligation to respect the choices '' of those who infringe upon the rights of another . Rapists make a `` choice . '' Murderers make a choice , molesters make a choice ... Are you `` obligated to respect their choices , '' Chester ? Maybe in the sense that they are free to make `` choices . '' You are . On that we will agree . But I expect we do n't always agree on what the consequences should be for some of the choices people make .
What else can you expect from a place like California ?
HEY ! ! We agree on something .
Would make , that is . However , not all members of the population are able to breed . Should we make this a thread for posting examples of natural selection ? That might be fun . An example : rats are often a problem . The solution ? Introduce rat poison . Unfortunately , some rats are immune to the poison . You should have guessed it- those rats reproduce , and the others do n't ( as much ) . Another : elephants use their tusks on predators and for ritual purposes ( attracting mates ) . Some elephants lack tusks or have shorter tusks . However , when poachers kill the elephants with the biggest tusks , the elephants with smaller tusks ( or no tusks ) reproduce more .
Just claim hyperevolution so that the millions of species today ( about 5 million named - estimates as high as 30 million ) can evolve from the few `` kinds '' that were able to be on the ark , around 16,000 by most creationist claims .
Except in the Dred Scott case the court was n't trying to determine whether slavery was a collective or individual right , or what the constitution applied to in regard to slavery .
Well here is a christian who supports abortion . I personally HAVE had an abortion . I had it several years , and while it was an extremely hard and emotional decision , I chose what was best for me . I was engaged ( now married ) , and both my then-fiance and I were on birth control ( I was on the pill and he used condoms ) . Unfortunately , despite those precautions , I became pregnant . We are n't that rich , and both of us our still finishing up our college degrees and are under enormous student loan burden . He supported my decision to abort as neither of us would have anywhere near the time or money to support a baby ( hence our use of contraception ) , and neither of us have taken a full job in our fields yet to be able to provide that money to pay for the loans let alone a child . I think this is one of the many circumstances in which abortion is absolutely justifiable , especially because I think that except for rare circumstances , abortion should be allowed up to the third trimester ( the exceptions would be if the woman 's life was in danger , etc . for a later abortion ) . As to God not supporting abortion ? Rubbish . If you 'd like I could give you verses in which he not only supported abortions , but ordered forced abortions through his people ( that is if you take the OT as literally true )
Just ca n't satisify `` them thar ' Moralizers . '' I remember the election of 1960 , and how many were worried about JFK taking his `` orders from Rome . '' Maybe that is why we are a land of laws , not of men .
My first line of defense for up to 300 yards is an M4 ( specops m16 ) flattop with an ACOG scope and tritium backup sights , 14.5 barrel with a 1/7 twist with mccluek ( sp ) muzzle brake to make it the legal 16 inches . foward pistol grip and a surefire light mounted to my knights RASII . I keep 45 grains in the clips so they frange and not penatrate walls . I keep a second clip with 77gr noslers in a mag-cinched clip for longer range shots . I use a long range Shephered scope on my .308 chambered m14 for shotting zombies out to 1000 yards . And to compliment my defensive ability I keep a romanian AK in my bugout bag with a surefire light and an OKO red dot scope for quick egress when reliability is of most importance and close range firefight is likley . ( this in not to mention the plethora of pistoles and handguns I keep for home defense also ) . THe m4 is 1.5 MOA , The M14 ( m1a ) is sub MOA , and the AK is a typical 3-4moa . BTW . I have had military and civilian training in all of these weapons I also keep a well trained Caucasian Mountain dog roaming the house at night so if anyone where to make it inside I doubt there would be anything left of him by the time I got there ... Preparedness my friends ... Now VoR probably keeps his Rechargable phone next to his bed and a whistle around his wifes neck and a fancy pug roaming the house ... Dear Mr. Criminal , Which house would you like to break into . SIncerely , 1 constitutional rights violator and 1 law abiding citizen .
A sign like that would hardly be nessecary where I live . We have very restrictive gun-laws and hardly anyone owns a gun . And no , people does not discipline themselves . You might claim I have to much trust in the government , I would claim you have to much trust in your fellow man . When you give freedom to the people you give freedom to criminals too . I don´t trust guns to only be used in 'selfdefense ' . I want my government to uphold justice and to protect me from criminals . That´s one of their purposes . And that is impossible without a certain amount of control over the citizens .
Being in the minority or in the majority is irrelevant . Belief has no bearing on reality .
Actually , Simone , if you spend more time on their website and research a little deeper , you will find that they are also `` right wing wingnuts '' but they happen to want `` sensible '' gun policies in order to eliminate violence ( clearly delineated from war ) with the use of guns in all countries . Essentially they are the ones you are griping about and stereotyping . Provide a decent basis of argument besides a stereotype please .

That statement exposes your ludicrousy . First , you say you 're against killing children who do n't have a chance . Then you say the death of the Kurds and the WTC mean nothing to you . What chance did the children in the gassed Kurdish village have ? What chance did the children in the WTC Day Care Center have ?
Yes , you are missing something . How come age does n't start at conception ? How come when babies are born they are n't 9 months old instead of , well , seconds old .
So , does this mean Creation Science is different from creationism ?

http : //www.nytimes.com/2009/03/03/science/03angi.html . Ive had three children , which gave me an opportunity to observe intimately the development of infants . Also , I worked with emotionally unstable children aged 3 and older , and observed what a delightful species the three-year-olds are . At that point , infants have progressed from the largely self-involved awareness of the 24-month infant as the developing human deals with the problem of separateness and , as a result , issues a robust declaration of independence . No ! No ! No !  are the bywords of a two-year-old . No ! I wont ! And you cant make me ! 
But again , that requires a YEC to contradict their belief in the flood . As earlier stated , previous YECs have gone into the field , looked at the data and evidence and abandoned YEC as it makes absolutely no sense . YEC 'science ' is not used in hydrocarbon production .

No - but then the feral child illustration was intended to highlight the significance of human social 'DNA ' to humans , not to imply that it can civilize any old species . However , you raise a good point which I can turn to my advantage : let 's replace the dogs in your reversed scenario with , say , chimps . Can they learn table manners and use silverware , learn to use the toilet or bathe themselves ? Yes . I 've seen a bonobo prepare a boil-in-the-bag meal . I consider my point concerning the role of social DNA in distinguishing human from animal pretty much made
Yes . That 's it .

Freethought Today , November 2008
Very well , I accept your challenge .
Darwin spent 20 years after his voyage on the Beagle piling on the evidence for his theory and developing it further before the first Origin publication . He took hundreds of samples of birds from different parts of the world as evidence . He was an avid insect collector - he used those to support his theory . He conducted experiments in his greenhouse . Fossils displayed at the London Natural History Museum were used as evidence for his theory . THAT is how one collects evidence for a theory , not by just inferring that animals and plants are here , so they must have had a designer . There has not been a single piece of evidence for ID that I am aware of - from what I 've seen , supporters of ID merely attempt to debunk Darwin 's theory - hardly evidence . ID advocates use the eye as evidence for something that 's so complex that it could n't have evolved . In fact , we have a very good idea of how the eye evolved , we can not only see it happen among fetus ' , but there are plenty of animals alive today that have inferior or primative eyes . Again , this is not evidence for ID , saying 'The eye is complicated , God must have done it '' . Have you ever read the first edition of Origin of Species ? It 's completely semantic free . You dont even need to know anything about science or biology to understand it . And I rarely hear evolutionists use terms like `` designed for '' . It 's much more terms such as `` evolved for '' or `` adapted to fit '' . But even so , nature has blindly designed organisms to better suit their environment , so terminology in this case matters not .
... and 8 beers are imo worse than one joint . People tend not to smoke as many 'doses ' of pot as they drink 'doses ' of alcohol .
Oh ... so humans all must have the same bone structure ? Kind of like pigmies and Kenyans look so similar . I 'll prove to you on a future post how Neandertals developed their traits -- including their bone structures through a nonrandom mechanism .
So what if overriding other instincts is an instinc ? ( and there you go with natural again , why are human instincts not natural instincts ? ) Pretty much everything we do is instinctual .
But you specified that you were about to define biological evolution and then gave a definition that does n't apply . It really does n't matter that you mentioned `` biology '' in the second definition , you had already stated that your first definition also applied .
Your technicality bs is not needed here ... granted you have only made 20 posts or so .
Yes . The better question is , did it happen just like in Genises ? I do n't think so .
Oh but I wish the -5.3 won world series games for the Yankees was the truest information you could get in baseball . That would make me so happy . So would the Red Sox winning the 1000000 , and the Kansas City Royals winning 2 .
Actually there is one other point of view . The `` Do n't Care What the Bible Says '' one .
Just so we 're clear here , your idea of `` proving your point '' that I 'm dishonest is to call me dishonest . Yeah , not quite how it works outside of Archie-land . Sorry .
I think it depends on what they were charged with . Rapist-no child molester-no Basically most or all crimes of violence-no Possession of pot-o.k . your basic chicken # # # # stuff .
See above . Whether a couple is or is n't monogomous is not for you to determine or worry about . And speak for yourself if you do n't mind . This member of the American public 's mental health is just fine thank you very much . If gay marriage impacts YOU that much , well that sounds like your problem .
While that may be true for some - perhaps even many - I was just responding to the OP . That said , I think it foolish to claim/believe that the bible is all wrong . I consider myself an atheist , but I fully recognize - and expect - that much , perhaps even most of the events mentioned in the bible actually occurred . I do , however , also realize that the books of the bible were written at a much different time , that even real events were likely embellished , in some cases to the point of absurdity ( knocking down walls with great shouts and the like ... ) . Although I do not and will not pretend to be a biblical scholar or historian of any sort , it seems to me that the bible could be seen as a biased , mythology-laden chronicle of the history of a particular group of people . Interesting historically , but not very reliable as a guide to the true events of the time , and even less so for a guide to moral behavior and describing a Universe-creating Deity .
Way back when I was an undergraduate my professor of evolutionary biology told us about a careless zoo keeper that put polar bears and brown bears in the same pen during a remodeling . The result was a litter of hybrid offspring . It seems that polar bears and brown bears are perfectly interfertile . Not only that , it has been shown that the offspring are also interfertile with either species . DNA analysis has been able to distinguish brown bears from polar bears except in the case of the brown bears of the ABC islands . They are indistinguishable from polar bears . And yet , even if a brown bear where white or a polar bear were brown , they are so obviously different in morphology that they would be classified as separate species . The differences go far beyond color .
Depends on the usage . Generally , it just refers to the Theory of Evolution or a change in allele frequencies in a population .
The article is saying that it was genetic changes . Changes in genes encoding certain transcription factors is what caused changes in the expression of other genes .
Very well put .
NO I mean every word of what I type . If they institute these rules I will back off gay claim to marriage and accept that marriage is about children . As long as they continue to let 70 and 80 year olds get married marriage is not about children and there is no reason to exclude gay people . I would also add one more lisencing rule 8 No one may have children with out a marriage lisence .
A modern court requires signed affidavits or sworn testimony . These five hundred people remain unnamed and carry on with their lives as if it never happened . How would a modern court view the hearsay of 500 witnesses and no resultant effect of the allegation ?
haha , good question .
This is just ridiculous . The argument does n't require the connection to be natural or artificial . Whether it is one or the other makes no difference in terms of the morality . If the point is irrelevant , the objection is irrelevant .
I don ; t really know anything about british gun control in colonial india , and do n't really see it 's relevance , since colonial india is gone . I DO know that this had nothing to do with the British refusal to conscript indians into the British Army . This was directed at the disarming of the Indian Army under british rule . The indian citizens were never actually disarmed under British rule , just the army . During WWI , indians were allowed to volunteer for the British army ( the British knew it was a bad idea to conscript men from colonies ) .
Well , as we can see from other recent posts , your reading comprehension is below high school level . I do n't get it . Why do folks think lying enhances their POV ?
How about a sin tax of $ 100 dollars each time you log on and $ 10 dollars a word for each time you speak one ? It 's fair because it would help pay for all the lying propaganda damage you do to society . Rights come with responsibilities . On guns , no can do . SCOTUS has ruled many times that a right freely stated in the Constitution can not be compelled to purchase a license nor a fee to exercise . NEXT !
It is pretty bizzare . There are plenty of groups out there that will reach whatever `` conclusion '' you pay them to reach . Why he did n't cite one of them instead of an easily checkable source that says the opposite of what he says they do is beyond me .
They 're going after retailers selling ones that do n't . Duh !
Sickle cell trait confers malarial resistance , a phenotypic benefit . I 'm not going to go charging off finding more examples if you 're just going to stick your fingers in your ears and pretend you ca n't hear me .
Oh but that 's just too good to resist ... . Ill just mention one word : Mexicans ... .
Well of course it 's about petitions that would lead to amendments . What else would it be about ? Nevertheless it is still a voting process . That 's how amendments are done . What I 'm asking is , does this bill mean that ANY issue that could come up as an amendment would be illegal ? And if not , ( the more important question ) how would they determine what constitutes civil rights . ( Which you did n't answer , but rather basically said 'I do n't know but rest assured they do ' ( to paraphrase ) . Get it now ? Anyway , on further review , I believe that the bills only apply to whatever falls under the catagory of 'civil rights ' , however the heck that is to be determined !
Yes , there are a lot of us that have been waiting . I 'm sure the delay will have been worthwhile though .
Typical ... dragging science down to the level of religion !

OH GOODY ! Another meaningless quote .
So if I did find a vender , then what would you say ? Why do we prevent the importation of weapons grade plutonium ? Should n't that be protected under the second amendment ? Why does n't the government allow people to produce nucleur weapons ? If the government suddenly stopped all production of guns except those that were sold to the Department of defense , would it suddenly make this arguement moot ?
Well Nozz . I hear Canada or Mexico are looking for a few good ( did I say good ? ) men . Kind of a dirty trick to pull on them though .
The ATF declared both .30 cal M2 AP and 5.56mm M855 Ball ( w/steel penetrator ) to be `` non-AP '' rounds . For those of you that have a problem with law abiding citizens having and using `` AP '' ammo ... .wake up ! We ARE law abiding so what are you worried about ... ..or do you think I do n't `` need '' it ? If so..who are you to tell me what I `` need '' ? I have a rifle match next month ... I think I 'll go load up some AP for it since AP tends to shoot better in my M1 than regular Ball . : D
yes , and i suppose an idea of perfection can exist , in a thinker 's mind , and subjective to the thinker 's standards of perfection . i could also point out that an imperfect thinker , with no reference or standard of `` objective '' perfection , is incapable of having a perfect idea of anything . therefore the argument falls apart at the first premise , since an `` idea of perfection '' can not exist , unless the thinker himself is perfect , which would make him God by his own definition .
So students do n't deserve their constitutional rights ?
It 's not funny when you realize what he was talking about in the first place : Strata . Your lack of education is showing .
So you 'd ask on these issues even if you did n't know if they had signed it ?
Apes are sentient ... guess your theory is out the window . Either that or Apes need to be freed from the zoo .
And you have been refuted time after time . Lies , damn lies and statistics is a starting point . Its the false idea of the more powerless you render yourself the safer you will be . I bet you strongly believe its possible to pick up a turd by the clean end .
The Supreme Court has declared that the Second Amendment is n't about hunting , so this argument is dead and moot . I 'd also suggest that you and this article author do a little research and get with the times . The AR-15 has officially been adopted as the hunting rifle of the 21st century . Remington now makes a version , the R-15 , marketed exclusively toward hunters .
I think she is supposed to either scratch at him with her keys , or spray them with hairspray . I am sure we will se a lot more pages like the above linked in the near future . Now that Lotts research has been given the green light by the NAS , in fact , being the only body of research with which they found NO issues ( oddly enough , the anti gunners research was FULL of holes ) , there is nothing left to attack him on , and his work has been vindicated . So , lacking any real material with which to attack his actual work , the anti gunners are essentially stepping back and calling him a `` dummy head '' . In todays modern political/academic environment , what higher form of flattery can there possibly be than charachter assasination ? It is what they fall back on when they find your argument to be irrefutable . The NAS study was supposed to be `` their study '' . Instead the findings basically run that anti gun researchers are mostly liars who use HIGHLY questionable methodology , pro gun researchers are refreshingly honest , and at the end of the day , the pro gunners have won the war of statistics . It is over , there is really no point to debating it anymore . We have seen the most scritinized review of the available data EVER , and the antigunners have had the wind knocked out of their sails . Until some new data becomes available , I am pretty much done debating the statistical aspects . You want to call Lott a cross dressing dummyhead who was more than a little creepy as far as his defense of his work ? go ahead . The fact remains that despite the anti gunners best efforts ( which currnetly seems to be Donohue and Ayres ) , his work has been vindicated . Now , if there is any anti gunner out there who dares argue history in regards to this , lets go ! As Bryan pointed out in another thread , the antis generally seem to feel weakest in their argument when it comes to history , while the pro gunners seem to feel weakest when it comes to the social costs of gun ownership . GOOD NEWS for the pro gunners , we are now strongest in not only history , but the social aspects of gun control as well . We now know for sure that the antis gunners are living in lala land . Their argument is completely unsupportable .
The first problem would be finding a country where there has been a sucessful gun ban . As far as I know , every country on the planet experiences some violence related gun use , even the ones with draconian gun control laws . Even in te Soviet Union , where posession of illegal firearms could potentially lead to a death sentence , there was still shootings .
So Simone , if the shooter had instead driven his Toyota Prius into a crowd , killing many as a result , would you call for banning Toyota Priuses ?
Actually , they are genetic . Our cells have receptors which are triggered by exposure to pathogens ; that 's how we `` learn '' to fight off a disease . And not everyone has the same receptors , which ones you posses is a genetic trait . It 's one of the reasons that Native Americans were so vulnerable to European diseases , they had n't evolved the receptors that would have enabled them to build up defences against the diseases the Europeans had lived with for generations . If your hypothesis was correct we would n't see different populations having different reactions to the same disease .
Facts to support your denial are not in evidence .
If you could come up with a disproof of it , you would be assured of a Nobel prize and fame far into the future .
Then you are probably a bit older than I . My mother was 45 in 1963 , the year I entered the Army . My mother will be 86 next month and we have a party planned with her older sister , nieces , grand nephews , grandchildren , and great grand children . I am so sorry for your early loss . My father died at 73 from complications after a `` successful '' surgery . It was still difficult .
Well , if intelligent design can come up with evidence , and a way to TEST it , rather than just saying 'This is too complicated , an intelligence must have done it ' , then maybe scientists would take it seriously .
Same place . Australia . That , after 5 or 6 thousand illegal guns were just handed in during the last in a series of never-ending amnesties .
Well of course . This spiritually dead church which exists to serve Man , but not God , must compromise biblical principles in order to attempt to preserve membership in an ever expanding secular humanist society . Just remember that no matter how many churches abandon the spiritual truths outlined in Gods Word in these last days , it does nothing to diminish or nullify that truth .
After God had `` created '' the lights , that means when the lights ca n't pass through an non-transparet object , there 's a shadow and gone `` darKness '' , but the `` one '' who wrote the bible should be God but seemed did n't know this phenomenon , that `` writer '' said : God had to `` divide '' the light from darkness . That prove : - the writer was just someone who did n't have that scientific knowledge in the old days . Do you agree ? ? ?
Again , why would `` some of the worlds greatest minds working on and devising ways to keep it afloat so that the vast majority of the population can continue to be snow-blinded ? ''
I know that . It was not my intention to show that a deity does not exist ; I wanted to refute the fundamentalist interpretation ( again ) .
Yes , many people I feel are that arrogant .
Ca n't say .
A minor point , but your opening question is confined to `` during pregnancy '' and your concluding scenario is confined to childcare . The baby has no need of breast milk or a substitute formula until it is a breathing human . In that case , the mother ( at least in the USA ) is obligated to feed it , whether she uses her own milk or a substitute . I do not understand the interest in things before the 14th Amendment . ************************* The 14th Amendment : Section 1 . All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside . No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . Section 2 . Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers , counting the whole number of persons in each State , excluding Indians not taxed . But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States , Representatives in Congress , the Executive and Judicial officers of a State , or the members of the Legislature thereof , is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State , being twenty-one years of age , ( See Note 15 ) and citizens of the United States , or in any way abridged , except for participation in rebellion , or other crime , the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State . Section 3 . No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress , or elector of President and Vice President , or hold any office , civil or military , under the United States , or under any State , who , having previously taken an oath , as a member of Congress , or as an officer of the United States , or as a member of any State legislature , or as an executive or judicial officer of any State , to support the Constitution of the United States , shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same , or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof . But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House , remove such disability . Section 4 . The validity of the public debt of the United States , authorized by law , including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion , shall not be questioned . But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States , or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave ; but all such debts , obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void . Section 5 . The Congress shall have power to enforce , by appropriate legislation , the provisions of this article . ************************** This has little to do with a mother 's obligations and rights regarding her children . It does prohibit states from denying rights , but it says nothing of a mother 's milk . States do have laws against deliberately starving children .
No , you obviously are not reading the arguments in their contexts . I never said you should believe anything . I simply pointed out that Cali 's statement about MOST Christians believing in a literal Genesis was false . That was my only point .
Yes . The US Constitution is secularist , but it 's not atheistic .
And I will fight on it until you can open your eyes to the needs of living and view women as real live people , too .
So know we are breaking it down to whether the loss of life is deliberate . The restaurant bombing . We thought Saddam was there . We KNEW civilians were there . We dropped four 2000lb bunker buster bombs on/around the restaurant . We KNEW that civilians would be killed . We knew that by pressing the button , the bomb would be dropped and people would die . Compare that to the manufacturers . They make products that people use in their daily lifes . There is n't a button somewhere in the cigarette maker 's office that kills a smoker when he decides it 's time for them to die .

And he 's out ! By the way , why did you say `` strike III '' and not `` strike 3 '' ?
You have this habit of making sweeping claims with little to no substantiation . And even if we were to completely ignore LeVay altogether , there is MOUNDS of other evidence showing a genetic cause . Like I keep pointing out , but nobody on your side of the fence seems to realize , NARTH 's OWN CITED REFERENCES say there is a genetic cause !
Yes , Joe , I agree . Does this new class apply to the new straight couples as well ?
Because it was reported that every U.S. medical association was against the ban . My only source was MSNBC .
You say you can not see it from the gay perspective , then you speak from that perspective as a gay man . This is confusing . As a heterosexual , if you are one , would you give up those rights and let gays have the rights ?
Oh - so you do n't want to force me through pregnancy at any cost to me ? You will let me make what decision is best for me ? You will actually realize that I am in the best position to know ?
How many cases have there been of a person having their personal firearm taken right out of their hands by a criminal , never to be seen again ?
so is it better to be murdered by a knife than a gun ? final thought , you are advacating removing hundrides of millions of dollers of property from millions of legal gun owners , becouse of thousandes of scum bags .
Those are removed from the gene pool by natural selection . The other mutations stay in the pool . Pandion : we are making progress- he admits that mutations can be helpful .
I have posted responses to Demon38s earlier post . I have offered DNA findings as evidence to begin with . It is not my evidence , but scientific evidence . That is the only evidence that I will provide in this discussion . I think there is ample evidence to cause scientists to rethink their theories , evidence that they do not want to accept because it puts certain hypothesis they have advanced in a poor light .
You mean you can choose how you accept it ?
Nothing ... . they both have to live with the shame of killing their baby .
By the way , I do believe that natural selection was accepted before Darwin . It was believed that natural selection killed the `` freaks '' and ensured that a population of organisms stayed the same ; in other words , I think I recall that it was originally believed that natural selection kept populations from changing . It was Darwin who understood that natural selection would actually lead to changes in the species . Creationists have always had a problem with how to fit so many animals in the ark . The modern creationists now propose that Noah only took a few `` kinds '' onto the ark , and after the flood these few kinds evolved into the diversity we see today . Ironically , creationists have to accept Darwin 's theory to solve an important problem that they had , and they do n't even give Darwin the credit for this .
Yes that would solve the problem would n't it , worked the first time around , I say that because we ( U.S. ) are compared to the wild west . But be they whites , Blacks , Reds , or pi** purple shoot a few that try to detain or threaten you , yeah I think they will back off unless they are prepared to go to war .
Ha ! That is classic ! So Nihilism proves God ? ? ?

Why not ? Why should n't they be given at least closer to equal weight ? The baby is going to be as real and genuine of a person as the mother ; the only difference is that the baby is a few years behind . You 're talking about a difference of time .
Even if they work together sometimes , the times that they do n't is enough to make your claims nonsense . Apparently you have never watched a pride of lions , or a pack of wolves or coyotes eat . The strongest eat first . When food is scarce , some may not survive .
Something that would let you become a better hunter or escape from hunters is `` completely useless '' ? I do n't think so . Even so , how is `` completely useless '' a deteriment to evolution ? Our fingernails are `` completely useless '' and yet we still have them . Nipples on men are `` completely useless '' but are still present none the less .
Peppered moths simply emerged from the egg according to background ... their `` evolution '' had nothing to do with random mutations or natural selection . Butterflies exhibit the same ability ... they can emerge with specific wing variations/markings according to predators and other environmental influences . There is no selection . http : //ourfcs.friendscentral.org/mot ... yphenism1.html ( see bottom picture ) http : //unisci.com/stories/20021/0313021.htm The authors note that what 's not known about wing patterns in butterflies are the genetic mechanisms that result in the great variety of patterns that exist and an understanding of how those mechanisms have evolved through time yea ... no kidding .
You know what ? I do n't care if it ties the hands the police behinds their backs , puts a ball gag in their mouth and a bag over their heads , and dumps them by the side of the road like garbage ! We do n't live in a police state . The powers of the police must come second to the rights of the people . Otherwise you 're basically saying that the police should have the power to carry out warrantless searches of your home and private property , without reasonable suspicion and without justification . Under your standard the police should be allowed to break down your door in the middle of the night , destroy your home in their quest for evidence of some wrongdoing , and if they find nothing then you have no legal recourse over the destruction of private property . The police work for we the people . Our taxes pay their salaries . They should n't be allowed to exercise total control over us . Such standards creates a nation of fear and distrust that breeds resentment for authority , and is the leading cause of the creation of cop killers .
Good points IMHO . I think you are holding your own here . But I want to read your views on how your detailed analyses can make a real difference . There are many with pre-conceived notions about evolution they learned in high-school , so changing opinions is not easy . Your ideas would really be a help here . Thanks
Surely the theory of evolution can not predict whether a species is extinct or not ! I thought that crocodiles and alligators were in about the same state as they were millions of years ago and that was because thier habitat did not require them to change therefore the odd slight mutations that gain the advantage and lead to change was of no advantage . If the coelacanth 's habitat was no condusive to change then the same would apply .
Oh give it a rest ... Just because you have the attention span of a lemur does not mean I am posting `` propaganda '' Kelvin will vouch for the depth I have contributed in the past ... So if you are so willing to violate my civil rights will YOU be coming to get my guns or will you be sending someone elses child to do your nazi dirty work ?
This must comfort you .
So let 's just kill them and be done with it . Is that what you 're saying ?
It needs to come with life to make life meaningful . To have no control of your body - like rape , like an abusive relationship . I would rather be dead than go through it again .
Rofl What were they supposed to do if they stayed in the egg longer with more time to feed off of it ? Shrink ?
Not to be totally dependant and the systems of another body to keep it alive . Take a fetus out of the womb ( That is during the period which most abortions are carried out ) and it will die . Plus if the mother dies the fetus will as well . A baby does n't depend on its mother 's body to function . It can do that itself .
You keep claiming that , but you never reference it . Id like to see sources and names . Just because evolutionary sources do n't claim to be engaging in a PR exercise does n't mean they are n't doing it . There is plenty of evidence of it , even if they do n't honestly admit it .
Excuse me , I stand corrected . For 'pretend ' please substitute 'wrongly believe ' .
Oh , I do n't know about that . March of the Penguins was a box office success ANF an Oscar winner for best documentary . Calling any of Moore 's movies `` a documentary '' requires one to employ some artistic license with the term and some slight of hand .
Anyone else laugh out loud when they read this ? supersport- Maybe I 've missed it , but have you ever bothered to explain what you think scientists ' motives are behind this absurd and overly complex conspiracy you 've made up ?

Just because you say it doesnt mean it is true either .
If you define a fetus as a child , as AMD seems to by his/her statement , then yes , it does fit the definition .
Again your failure to understand what science is and how it works . Whatever your apostle tells you , science ca n't deny that something you may have seen is true . It can deny that it is n't science if it can not be explained by naturalistic observation . Most especially , if the observation ca n't be repeated by another , then it is n't science . Science can make no assertion as to what you saw . You may think it is wonderful , but LSD had that effect . How strange that you think that your emotions are scientific . Actually , it 's sad .
Because it works . How much money is pumped into microchip design and production ? IBM engineers must be so corrupt ; the temptation to lie about quantum theory so they can pretend to offer faster processors must be overwhelming ! And do n't get me started on the evolutionary algorithms they use - clear evidence of atheist bias and lying . As if evolution could design better microchips ! Research based on evolutionary theory is well funded because there 's massive potential for return on investment . Who funds ICR ? If you 're so keen to follow the money , at least do it consistently .
Why so many claims in opposition ? I make a single claim , that can be refuted through logic , if it 's fallacy . But the claim is correct . This new claim is an interesting one that I have seen others use . I 'll tell you on what basis . Based on reason . To hold that nothing can be known for certain , is ultimately reduced to absurd unintelligble nonsense . I 'll start a thread about this claim , it 's a hot topic to be sure !
See above . I wo n't bother trying to de-quote-mine until you can provide evidnece that variation is directed .
Simone , I salute you in knowing what a Jesuit is . Have you read the article I supplied ( keeping in mind that it is written by a Protestant researcher who is not a Jesuit ) ? Can you refute its points ?
Yes , the flow of illegal guns may go both ways . But the article says that 90 % of illegal guns seized by Mexican authorities come from the US . And these assault weapons are easily converted into machine guns . Gadgets that accomplish such a purpose are sold at gun shows . From the previously quoted article : `` When asked if he had any of the deadlier automatics , he led a reporter to a nearby table . `` There , James Ramey of Little Rock , Ark. , was selling Hellfire and Autoburst trigger activation devices , $ 30 gadgets that turn any assault rifle into a rat-a-tatting machine gun . '' I think much of the problem could be solved by extending the Brady background check to all gun sales . It does n't make sense not to . It 's kind of like the law requiring people to get a doctor 's prescription to purchase certain kinds of drugs but then having a `` drug show '' where people can purchase any kind of prescription drug without a doctor 's prescription .
Oh man . That is what the article first article says too ! Shotguns for £50 : study reveals weapons culture
This thread started with a challenge to God 's omnipotence . It had nothing to do with omniscience . Our definition of omnipotent is `` having virtually unlimited authority or influence . That appears to rule out the ability to do every conceivable task , uncluding those that are illogical . It does not diminish the power of God .
So suddenly , being supervised by not one , but two law-abiding qualified ( in one case an instructor ! ) adults is not safe ? Who administered the training and qualifications of the instructor ? Who drew up the regulations which allowed this to happen ? Who pays lip service to `` safety '' in the use of their deadly toys ? We constantly hear that only criminals with guns are a threat , and the law-abiding gun owner is a paragon of rational safe behaviour . This is all too obviously not so .
Define evil . The concept of evil is very subjective . If something is truly evil , then there must be an absolute concept of evil . But you will never come to agreement with everyone else in the world as to what makes something truly evil or good . What is your standard for determining what is evil ? Regarding the post above ... Hmmm ... Have you ever seen the planet Pluto ? How about Saturn ? Have you ever measured the sun with your own hands ? Have you ever walked completely around the earth to show that it was a sphere ( roughly ) ? The point is , there are many things that we accept as true because all known evidence suggests that it is true and no known evidence suggests that it is not true . Such is the case with evolution . Yes , the process of evolution has been observed and recorded by individuals . Just because YOU ( general you ) have n't witnessed it personally does not mean that you must accept it on faith alone . You could set up your own experiment or set out to study it for yourself and observe firsthand how it happens . But some people choose to learn from other people 's experience and accept the research of others .

Nor will there be economic upheaval if there is n't ( though there will probably be some regardless soon ) . Honestly though , do you think you would care more if it were blacks or jews being killed rather than feti and embryos ? I 'd certainly hope so ... if you condemn abortion clinic bombers you are setting a certain double standard . I just do n't think that a potential person can ever outweigh the wants and needs of an existing one , and 99 % of the time pro-lifers agree . Soon as you realise that its not actually 'babies ' being aborted then its a lot harder I think to hold a universally pro-choice opinion
How informative .
Because I do n't want women to have surgery and go through the stigma of it , or the trauma of a unwanted pregnancy . Because I do n't want women to have health problems in pregnancy .
This one certainly seems to be out of context , as reading a mere 2 verses farther yields the statement that `` [ Menahem ] did what was evil in the sight of the Lord . Are you then suggesting that what Menahem did was wrong ? I would agree . And so , apparently , does God .
So what ? Some of the greatest crimes in history have been led by people of faith . Take the Crusades for one , the religious knights killed every last man , women , and child in Jerusalem . It does n't discredit Christianity does it ?
Actually , the fact that children of gay parents are no more likely to be gay than children of straight parents directly refutes the original article . Children of gay parents have only one gender , which the original article pointed to as a cause for homosexuality . If NARTH 's article pretends to talk about the impact of a missing gender , then Charliegone 's article directly refutes .
Thanks , Clive , you 're a good sport . Of course I ca n't agree with the XXXXX part . Rash , unwise , unknowledgeable , maybe , but not fools .
So ? Is n't that exactly what we would want : people who conduct legal business instead of illegal business ? That means less crime , even if organized crime is still into other things . Making a drug illicit effectively creates another market for organized crime . Look at alcohol and prohibition . Alcohol was a huge market for organized crime back in prohibition days . How many mobsters or gangs still have distilleries ? They only people who operate illegal distilleries nowadays are indepedant brewers in rural areas . When you can get a wide variety of quality-controlled drugs at a licensed store down the road , no one wants to pay prohibition prices to get goods of uncertain purity or quality . Organized crime goes elsewhere to seek massive profits . I think marijuana is an easy case , its blatantly obvious that most of the harm done by pot on our society comes from associated crime : drug deals gone bad or turf wars , money put into organized crime 's hands , otherwise law-abiding citizens put in jail or given criminal records . More dangerous and addictive drugs are a harder sell , I think . Drug education is broken . Often , drug education is distorted to over-emphasize the dangers of drugs , which mystifies the drug , often increases their allure and destroys confidence in the source of information because the information is obviously biased and incomplete . With or without legalization , I believe the best solution to drug abuse is preventative : quality information and education . Reduction of poverty would do a lot to curb drug abuse ( and drug-related crime ) as well . Also , marijuana use in the Netherlands actually went down after legalization , as did alcohol consumption post-prohibition in the US back in the 30 's . I would have to hunt a bit around for references for those facts , though , but those facts show that you ca n't with certainty expect drug use to increase after legalization .
I know you think I was acting emotional with my post and it really is hard to tell whether someone is being emotional over a forum since it is so impersonal . What I can say is that posting about the Bible has become a mere formality to me and not the emotional debate it used to be . However , I believe it is necessary to eliminate the Bible from debates of this sort by discrediting it right away . Then at least we can focus on real solutions based on what is real instead of what some weirdo wrote thousands of years ago .
Actually I really do n't depend on the entertainment industry to give me a realistic picture of anything . I highly recommend you do n't , either . What I know about gay people is from knowing gay people .
Actually , the whole basis for modern science depends on the assumption that the universe was made by a rational creator . Dr Stanley Jaki has documented how the scientific method was still-born in all cultures apart from the Judeo-Christian culture in Europe ( Science and Creation ( Edinburgh and London : Scottish Academic Press , 1974 ) ) . An orderly universe makes perfect sense if it was made by an orderly Creator . But if there is no creator , or if Zeus and his gang were in charge , why should there be any order at all ? Loren Eiseley stated ( Loren Eiseley : Darwin 's Century : Evolution and the Men who Discovered It , Doubleday , Anchor , New York ( 1961 ) : The philosophy of experimental science began its discoveries and made use of its methods in the faith , not the knowledge , that it was dealing with a rational universe controlled by a creator who did not act upon whim nor interfere with the forces He had set in operation It is surely one of the curious paradoxes of history that science , which professionally has little to do with faith , owes its origins to an act of faith that the universe can be rationally interpreted , and that science today is sustained by that assumption. C.S . Lewis also pointed out that even our ability to reason would be called into question if atheistic evolution were true ( God in the Dock ( Grand Rapids , MI : Eerdmans , 1970 ) pp . 52-53 ) : If the solar system was brought about by an accidental collision , then the appearance of organic life on this planet was also an accident , and the whole evolution of Man was an accident too . If so , then all our thought processes are mere accidentsthe accidental by-product of the movement of atoms . And this holds for the materialists and astronomers as well as for anyone else 's . But if their thoughtsi.e . of Materialism and Astronomyare merely accidental by-products , why should we believe them to be true ? I see no reason for believing that one accident should be able to give a correct account of all the other accidents. Further more , on what basis can we study the world in any coherent way and come to sensible conclusions about it ?
You have any examples of that ? Shooting people for throwing rocks and eggs at houses that is .
Actually the room , straps , and table are all multi-use . And the drugs only cost Texas $ 86.08 per execution as of 2002 .
And your point was demonstrated to be specious using your own source . To contain strawmen even as you claimed it to be a strawman .
Probably the same reason why John Kerry wo n't disclose his medical and senate attendance records . She is not going to be punished now for aborting a kid 30 years ago .
Very true , especially since when someone asks `` is there a God '' they are most likely really asking `` does the God in which I believe exist ''
So why can not juvenile crimes which would otherwise be death penalty eligible be treated on a case-by-case basis ? Under the theory of variable neurophysiological development , we could suppose that some individuals under 18 will have a fully developed moral understanding , and also some individuals 18 and over who do not .
Wrong and right . Evolution is both a verified phenomenon and a biological Theory .
More like the wrong side of the issues , ever in search of more money with the health insurance industry , I 'd say . Off the blood of your fellow Americans . Shoot down sounds appropriate though .
My outburst was meant to show that even a seven year bombardment of religious propaganda can be ineffective if no reasons whatever are advanced for reaching the conclusions that the theists desire . Theology is a bogus `` study '' of infinite pretensions and of an unknowable `` reality '' . Yet I would n't describe atheism as a religion : essentially it 's a disbelief in the existence of God because there is no good reason for doing so and there are good reasons not to .
You know , that sounds exactly what you are doing . I guess you are as foolish as they are .
See above . A lock can create doubt about the ease of entry into a residence . Many criminals move from door to door until they find one that is unlocked , rather than drawing undue attention by smashing one in .
Shh shhh it 's ok mellow mellow mellow . Relax you have managed to go from legalizing gay marriage to a collapse of our legal system and the downfall of man 's ability to reason and govern himself in two paragraphs . Maybe gay people would like to enjoy some of the happiness you get from your marriage and same as you that happiness is worth the oppressiveness incurred as a result . You may have more in common with gay people than you think .
You make an excellent point , Shooter . While I do n't feel the `` voter referendum '' idea should be abolished completely , there should be limits as to what should and should not ever be put to a simple majority vote , which I feel is like a state being able to cancel out the republican ( little `` r '' ) concept upon which our country is wisely based and revert to mob rule . Whatever the majority of a state 's populace 's preferences or prejudices , they should NOT be allowed to put up for majority vote issues that openly contradict that state 's constitution , as interpreted by those they elected in the first place . ( I 'm speaking California here . I know in some states their Supreme Court judges are appointed -- nevertheless , those that appoint them are elected . ) If they want to vote in new judges , fine . New legislature , fine . But once they 've voted them in , I do n't feel they should be able to go around , gather a few hundred thou signatures , put on the ballot an initiative to negate the rulings , and spend scads of money ( mostly from out of state , yet ! ) to go `` booga booga '' to lie to , mislead and frighten people to overrule the decisions of the people whose legal knowlege and wisdom they voted to abide by in the first place . This voter initiative thing , at least in my state , is seriously flawed .
I believe the Bible is correct in every detail . The difference is how those who read them choose to interpret their meaning . You , for instance , look at a verse that says the earth can not be moved and take that to mean that the Bible says that the earth does not move PERIOD . I believe that that means that God is powerful enough to keep the earth from simply `` flying out '' of its orbit and rocketing off into space somewhere . Yes , I proudly `` cling '' to the idea that a flood covered the mountains . I believe fully in the ENTIRE Bible ( unlike some people ) and I DO NOT `` pick and choose '' what I believe .
Really , I think it he or she is .
Agreed . That is why a sensible interpretation , of new data , is so important !
It would be more accurate to say that evolution has selected for reproduction and death over immortality and self-repair - if the latter is even possible .
so if for instance enough people think that to exterminate the Jews is good , then it has to be good ? the rule of the mob rules right ?
No . According to current cosmology , hydrogen atoms were able to form about 3 minutes after the big bang when the background radiation fell to a level below that of the binding energy of atomic nuclei . During this period the synthesis of several light nuclei occurred - hydrogen , deuterium ( heavy hydrogen ) , helium , and lithium . In fact , we do n't know what caused the big bang . Our physics does n't seem to apply to conditions before about 10^-43 sec after the big bang . There is some speculation about quantum events , but nothing solid yet . When the big bang was first proposed by a Jesuit priest , Einstein rejected it . Einstein `` believed '' in a steady state universe . Only after Hubble demonstrated that the universe was expanding did Einstein accept the idea of a point origin for the universe . The Pope called the big bang the moment of creation .
and
So strange ! I am an Atheist , yet I must defer to the 25th Chapter of Matthew in the New Testament , verses 35-36 , the reference of Christianity :
He was refering to the result of Heller vs. DC , because the bill repealed stated that a child can not own a firearm . As expected , he was parroting Brady propaganda . However , the Brady campaign either did n't know , or ( more likely ) ignored the fact that all must follow federal law . They said `` Aww , well they 're repealing a local law that forbids children from owning guns ! ! `` while they ignored the federal law that does that .
Ha , that is just an idiotic perspective . We 'd have no laws ( and many important ones ) if you ca n't make a bill that does n't affect you . Sorry Civil Rights legislation !
Ever notice that the examples used to illustrate gay unions are usually males ? I 'm guessing that the typical male fantasy is still `` ok. '' Sometimes it 's just better to be a gal !
I know what your `` point '' was . I also know what you ACTUALLY ASKED originally . You asked : `` Hey hypocrite , have you asked yourself how many millions of dollars every single pro-gay church spends each year promoting homosexual causes , including gay marriage and lobbying federal and State Governments directly in support of homosexual causes ? I think we 're still waiting on an answer ...
I think it goes something like that . Scientists have tried to repeat what they believe happened , but to no success . Anyway , atheistic evolution says that there is no intelligence , the scientists who were trying to repeat what may have happened have intelligence and they made many such measurements to try and create life from lifeless chemicals - in other words , the experiment was already logically flawed !
WOW , and you claim to be a teacher ? No matter our kids have the lowest scores in the World . Did n't you know that it was the democratic south that started the civil war to fight against the abolition of slavery ? And did n't you know that it was the democratic party that fought hardest against the 1964 civil rights act ? Until Johnson finally submitted a watered down bill compared to the Republican bill due to political and public pressure ?
Little late on the uptake here , but why is this the wrong thread ? I 'm familiar with the crime debate area , and there is a lot of crime debated here and the why with alls and this qualify 's , a sword rather than a gun is all .
You 're debating something that is no longer an option . You 're arguing on the grounds of debunked precedent , as if the previous interpretations of the Second Amendment are somehow still viable . Well they are n't anymore , arguing old standing is no longer going to be an option for you or anyone else . All of your previous arguments have been eliminated from the equation . It 's time to either evolve to meet the changing landscape , or go extinct like the dinosaurs .
So you are saying that despite the majority of the public opposing gay marriage , opposing it may be the wrong direction ? Good for you . You 're getting it .
Except that your picture is balderdash . I presume that you mean beetle , since a Beatle is one of the fab four . The wingless beetles of which you speak actually have wings . You seem to speak from ignorance of science while you accuse others of speaking of ignorance of creationism . Let me explain . When disected , the beetles of which you speak have fully formed wings under the fused wing covers ( which are themselves modified wings in beetles ) . It seems that time , in an evolutionary sense , has not been sufficent to make your `` wingless '' beetles wingless . Since the wing covers are fused , the underlying wings are useless . In another environment that would not be an advantage.This makes perfect sense in an evolutionary scenario . Wingless ( or fused wing cover ) beetles in my back yard get snapped up by the anole and the geckos . But the winds in my yard are rarely more than can be handled by any insect ( only once in over 20 years - huricane Alicia ) . And when that is the case , they go to ground and hang on . By the way , mutations do n't happen by natural selection . The very statement is utter nonsese . You are demonstrating your ignorance of biological science . Mutations ( of various types ) are changes in the genetic makeup of an individual . If those changes are in gonads that produce gametes , then they may be passed on to offspring . Mutations are one source of genetic variability in a population . It is that variability that is acted upon by other evolutionary mechanisms to change a population over time . Both mutation and natural selection are mechanisms of evolution . Mutation increases genetic variability , while natural selection tends to reduce it . There are other mechanisms ( sexual selection ( - ) , gene flow ( + ) , recombination ( + ) , genetic drift ( - ) ) . The very statement , `` mutation by natural selection '' shows ignorance of the subject . Please try to inform yourself of the topic before you speak in the future . I do n't mean to be unfriendly , but you have accused others of being ignorant of creationism when they were actually more informed than you . I presume that you are willing to admit your own ignorance of evolutionary biology .
You seem to think one example is the norm .
In the past 85 years , dating has drastically improved . You 're falsely saying that scientists have readjusted the date because it suits their timeline , rather then noticing that dating has improved and new techniques have been used on virtually every piece we have today . Learn to use Oczzam 's razor .
Apparently not . I live in Utah and every public school has a building on the grounds called the seminary . In seminary class they teach of all things the book of Mormon . A Mormon is basically a financial Christian with a whole other book of incredibly stupid poop in it . These Mormons are as lost a people as you will ever find , totally immersed in a cult fantasy world . So its not surprising .
But that 's not even how `` creation science '' , or any religiously motivated science works . There is no checking involved - what I mean by that is that answers are always ad hoc . It does n't matter if there is a better explanation available that does not involve mythology and superstition , if observations can be made to fit the religious scenario , it is evidence . Again , there is no checking of facts , i.e. , no testing , and of course , no predictions .
You mean Intelligent Design , and straight forward logical , rational , common sense arguments that require reason to move to the next step , instead of ideological consensus ... huh ? go figure ... Proponents of ID usually do n't argue religiosity or scripture , they let the empirical evidence prove it , funny ... that is what true science has always done . Verify the obvious , not ignore it in favor of some mindless postulations [ oddly ] convenient to how someone wants to live their life ; amazing how that works out ...
You do realise that by your definition , identical twins are the same 'life ' ? You do also realise that a freshly fertilised egg does not meet the standard criteria for judging whether something is alive ?
This may be true for a case that has n't already been decided . It 's a good argument for doing away with the death penalty and their expensive trials . However , his trial is over . Now that we 've been through the expensive trial , we 've yet to go through the expensive appeals after the sentencing . After we get through that , if he still retains the death penalty , it 's a lot cheaper to kill him than to keep him up 'til he dies in prison . The latest estimate I 've heard for keeping a prisoner alive is between 50 and 75 thousand dollars a year . He 's taking up space in a perfectly good cell . He 's using up perfectly good oxygen , food , clothing , heating and cooling energy , medical attention , etc . He should be killed straight away . Henry VIII would have no problem with lopping off his head ! Neither would I .
depends on your definition of `` human being . ''
So ? Life is cheap . You ca n't change that , the least you can do is profit from it . And people call me a leftist ! That 's a hardcore capitalist view .
Also keep in mind that some changes can happen quickly if you select for a quality that 's already present in the population . Something like beak size will following a bell curve . Most beaks close to average size , some larger than average , some smaller . If pressures change so that those with below average beak size gain some advantage than they can exploit it instantly . From the word go they will be eating better and be more healthy than their big beaked cousins , and so more likely to breed successfully come next breeding season . And if the little beakers are the most successful breeders than we would expect to see alot of little beaks in the next generation . Basically , the genetic variety is already present in the population , so exploiting that variety can happen quickly .
HOLY SH*T , marc . You 're doing EXACTLY WHAT THE REVIEW SAYS YOU PEOPLE DO . You 're making the claim without giving any explanation . `` OMG TEH SCEINCES IS ATHIESTIC BECUZ THEY JUST AER ! ! '' Thanks for making it extremely clear . Refuting a point by demonstrating it is n't very effective . Seriously , how disconnected from reality does one have to be in order to do something like this ?
Whenever you say , `` tsk tsk tsk '' , I know you got nothin ' .
Smaller budget for law enforcment.. Stop the so-called war on drugs . Disband the DEA , the BATFE , Have the FBI do these things on a very minor scale . REPEAL LAWS FOR MALA IN PROHIBITA CRIMES ! Shift the responsibility to the individual . REALEASE NON VIOLENT DRUG OFFENDERS ! Liberty encompases all people in all passions even if we disprove of thier PERSONAL behavior .
`` Probably '' is that your feelings on the subject or A scientifically supported statement .
What purpose does that serve with NCIS checks ?

Certainly ... just like how the makers of Expelled have repeatedly refused to publish the interviews in full . It 's not just that PZ and Dawkins object to the content of the movie -- the makers of Expelled do n't want them to be able to object in the first place . It 's always been their favorite argument against PZ to dangle over the head of his criticisms the fact that he has n't even seen the movie . They ca n't pull that one on Dawkins anymore , which is to their disadvantage , but fortunately they managed to spot PZ before it was too late .
And this is a terrific breakthrough . My partner and I are coveered by my company 's health insurance , and the state of Connecticut honors our Civil Union . That being said , I still have to pay tax on my partner 's health insurance as imputed income because the federal government refuses to acknowledge our union . So it has to be marriage . Full and without exception . Civil Unions are not enough when we are treated differently under the law .
Oh , boy ... here you come with your anti-religious bigotry rhetoric , who mentioned one thing about religiosity ? C'mon Simone ... let 's coddle those little bats of common sense back under the belfry of reason where they are supposed to roost ... They did n't need laws against it back then because peopel had more human dignity and respect for human life ... and they responded within the realm of decency and basic propriety . It is a shame we actually have to go there ...
Here 's an analogy Marc9000 : Ridiculously Absurd Comment User : Refutation Marc9000 : AtHeIsT !
Species may die out , but they may also evolve into new forms- without reproduction there is no possibility of continuity over even short periods of earth time , with it there is .
Since when does the word `` access '' get translated into `` must perform '' ? Women should have access to all medical diagnostic tests that can help them throughout their pregnancy . They should have access to sonagrams , CAT Scans , EKGs , EEGs , MRIs , blood tests , X-rays , etc. , None of these are forced procedures or tests now . While I have n't read the actual text of the legislation , I would find it unfathomable that any legislator would force a woman into a medical procedure .
You 're saying that if we track the causes of these diseases back to their source its sugar . You are then saying that modern humans have adapted to a high sugar diet by having smaller skulls , because if you eat a very sugar rich diet over a prolonged period of time you will suffer from degenerative diseases that cause the brain to shrink . The next generation responds to their parents degenerative disease by being born with a smaller skull ?
Of course throughout the whole Genome Project , although they have searched high and low for the gay gene , and they know where to look , they ca n't seem to find it . But I would n't deny that some chemical screw up in the fetal stage of development might not impact the sexual proclivities in some human beings . But so what if that is true ? According to the bible , the sin nature affects all aspects of our lives from diseases to the aging process to unnatural proclivities to sins such as rape , murder , adultery , homosexuality , incest , susceptibility to sex , alcohol and drug addiction , and innumerable other activities of the flesh which declare that we are seriously flawed due to our fall from grace which was brought about by our original sin of rebellion against God by disobeying Him via Adam and Eve . So there exists no consensus at all which declares that the liberal/secular humanist interpretation of reality is in any way correct . But that does n't stop your side from claiming victory as the correct interpreters of the non-evidence .
I 'd like to see some proof of this .
... ... now you 're just making stuff up .
Wouldnt it be wonderful if every woman in the world didnt have to be so alone , without a single helping hand , when she becomes a mother ?
In that case , your idea is already falsified , because there are too many intermediate fossils to count .
I am sure you meant `` mediate '' instead of `` medicate '' ? Or , is OSU a medical school ? Or , did you know the man was off his meds ? Exactly what does your rant mean other than you are so frustrated if you hear of a shooting in a Republic of over 3 million it drives you batty ? How many kids drowned in 5 gallon buckets between your two posts ? How many in car wrecks ? How many from blunt objects or knives ? Actually , death by guns is far down the list so why is it you go bananas when you hear of a shooting even if someone is killed or not ? You do understand there are justifiable shootings also ?
The vast majority of scientists do not believe in Creationism , and all those people you listed who say there are only 2 varients evolution or creationism -- they are't anthropological or theological experts . All they know is their westernized view . Their opinions have no reflection on Biology in that sense . THey should stick to Biology . There is only 1 true way -- that 's evolution . THe other 's are wishful thinking , whether they be the primordial flood , the divine parrot , or magic god who made people from dust .
Because the usual source of anti-gun statements on the 18th and 19th century tended to come from those who sought to keep indians and blacks unarmed and `` in their place '' by depriving them of arms .
There is no evidence in your eyes . There is tremendous evidence that the universe and everything in it was designed , even Darwin admitted that was the impression the evidence gave . Of course as an atheist he had to believe differently regardless of how absurd the story was . If particles to people was presented as a senario instead of science we would have no argument .
Again , how so ? If you can grip a tree with a birds foot and climb it while your preadator ca n't would be a great advantage . Likewise , a predator who can climb trees and get at the food sources up there would have a advantage over your competition . Ostriches and other flightless birds seem to get along just fine with their feet . Why would you say they were suffering from a detriment ?
Primitive and immature as compared to what or whom ?
The memo is real , nobody has ever been able to disprove it . Handgun Control Inc. ( the people who later became the Brady Campaign ) have claimed that the memo is a hoax and that what was released has never been their official position . However them simply stating this , is no different than Obama making a statement on national news , and then several months later saying `` I never said that '' and trying to reverse his position . Until it can be proven beyond doubt as being untrue and simple propaganda , the memo is real and explains in detail exactly what the gun control groups are after .
And , check out this YouTube presentation : Daily Kos : We need 10 million views of this YouTube by next week
Of course an explanation of artificial selection would talk about purpose . I 'm not sure how that is meaningful to the discussion . And of course , mention of eugenics is irrelevant to natural selection .
That was the point , Neanderthals have larger brains than humans , how have larger brains than 'earlier fossil humans ' if we 're going to use your terms . A switch to a more sugary diet ca n't explain brain sizes changing in both directions .
`` Sturm Gewehr '' ( pronounced-sturm ge-vare ) : D
I think bringing `` emotions '' into the question of whether God exists or not tends to cloud the issue a bit . Is n't the essence of atheism a rational enquiry which concludes that in the absence of any credible evidence , there is no reason to believe in God ? An emotional attachment to `` non-belief '' would be irrelevant ( and irrational ) .
That is exactly what I am saying . By no means do I condone big government saving the economy by any means , defense spending or anything resembling a modern New Deal . What may suprise you here is that I am afraid of people with guns ! Especially a large well equiped military . A large well equiped military can have politcal power unto itself . It is a large credit to our professional officer corps that we do n't have a miitary coup every few years . I just wish the rest of our government had the same discipline . Then I could entertain the idea of socialism . When the state has political power , it never gives it back . Before I get flamed , I am not advocating a military junta as form of government for the United States .
Nope mutations happen to individual cells . And hypermutation takes place and appears to be controlled at the level of individual cells also . You need to stick to the facts here .
From your source which indeed does have its own slippery slope built in . `` Another problem with estimating the number of gun laws is agreeing on a definition of just what is to be included . For example , many local laws prohibit carrying or firing guns in public places . Inclusion of such laws would certainly inflate national estimates of the number of gun laws . '' And here comes tada one of the slippery slopes . `` But if one considers only laws that control the manufacture , design , sale , purchase , or possession of gunsthe cluster of laws many probably imagine as constituting gun-control lawsthe number of local laws will be much smaller . With most gun laws containing numerous , interrelated subparts , there is also no clear rule for defining what should count as a separate law . '' And yet another . `` In short , no matter how the 20,000- gun-law figure was initially derived , the overwhelming trend toward preemption of local laws is likely to have substantially reduced the total . Even a very liberal interpretation of what should count as a separate law would leave the total well short of 20,000 . '' Yea right ! `` In our view , the discovery that there may be as few as 300 major statewide laws that fit our definition of a gun-control statute ( with some states having as few as one or two such laws ) yields a far more appropriate figure for public-policy discussion . '' In other words we do n't really have a clue here but we 'll call it short so we win . Nice try though .
If the foetus is aborted , that IS taking responsibility for one 's actions . leaving it for someone else to take care of is irresponsible .
How utterly stupid and untrue .
No , you probably wo n't be able to .
You are arguing from US law , I am arguing from Australian law . I think I needed to state this at the beginning . I have not heard of a US court case where a woman sued a hospital for bringing her back to life 'against her will ' . Though in America , anything is possible The oath of a doctor is to save a life . A woman who OD'ed would need to be saved .
So you really do believe that organisms `` are equipped with a means of making small errors that allow natural selection '' turn a reptile to a bird and a monkey into a man ? To be `` equipped '' means there is a design feature . You are betraying your belief system . The errors can only be arbitrary and random and the organism is not equipped to function in any predetermined fashion . In the following example that you provided : What is the context of the word 'truncated ' ? The way I read it - it is talking about a truncated string of code or something . What was truncated ? ... *more than 100 LPL gene mutations have been identified , the majority of which cause loss of enzymatic function . In contrast to this , the naturally occurring LPLS447X variant is associated with increased lipolytic function and an anti-atherogenic lipid profile and can therefore be regarded as a gain-of-function mutation . This notion combined with the facts that 20 % of the general population carries this prematurely truncated LPL ... *
Oh jeez , not the Ica stones ... http : //skepdic.com/icastones.html
Nope , I do n't deal in fiction and hyperbole ; I just deal in facts unlike the gun grabbers you support with wild off the wall claims they ca n't prove and neither can you prove your `` theory '' , you are far removed from reality .
You can try , but it wo n't be legal .
So what if the author is n't arguing against gun control ? At last , there is indication that England has taken a step in the right direction and realized that taking all guns away from everybody is n't the answer to crime .
Correct . This is a story of survival .
And perhaps you have overlooked the issue of abortion relating to crime . Who knows if were actually aborting future murderers ? Are n't you for crime prevention ?
But science classes are for teaching science and ID has not shown that it is science . There is no evidence and no research has been done yet . It has been around for more than a dozen years and we are still waiting for any actual research to be done .
And we have been down this road . Person can mean a living human ... which the embryo is . So like human , you can have person mean the organism itself .
Well then it sounds like you do n't even know what a SM is seeing as the 3rd one is the main one that people like you bring up when debating this isse .
Yes , brains in a vat , the Matrix , and Last Thursdayism are unprovable . That is why science has been so successful - it only deals with naturalistic explanations for naturalistic phenomena . An unconstrained supernatural force can provide an answer for anything ( fossils in the ground , complexity in organisms , etc . ) but will provide an explanation for nothing . Science is in the business of providing explanations - philosophy is down the hall and on your left .
Looks like dancing in the blood of innocents to me .
Actually , my wife and I discuss evolution all the time . She 's an evolutionary biologist . She did feel as if she had some duty to watch the show , just to stay on top of the sorts of things being said . She just has a low tolerance for willful stupidity . Which I totally understand .
This is actually humorous coming from you who has absolutely no concept that you are a spiritual being , or the extra dimension of yourself which that reality means to you . In other words antonia , It is the epitome of self deceit to lie to oneself about who they are . And you define that darkness which is the great lie you represent so completely .
and my wife is also a lot more likely to be overpowered if she has to close to with in a couple of feet of an invader , than if she can stay 15 or 20 feet back .
Well the blame falls to the county for issuing illegal marriage licenses . Such is the price for acting outside the law .
So let 's see ... it 's already illegal for an ex-con to be in possession of any kind of a firearm , and you 're saying that the banning of particular cosmetic features on a firearm would have somehow stopped this from happening ? How come you have n't gotten back to me about the North Hollywood Shootout of 1997 ? Why have n't you confronted the fact that the AWB did nothing to stop two criminals armed with AK-47s from holding the entire California police force at bay ? I do n't know who 's stupider , you or Galileo . What you 're suggesting is like trying to stop bank robberies by banning the wearing of ski masks .
Yeah , so if on my math test , I put `` The answer is 7 because my god says so '' and the teacher marks it wrong , he 's the XXXXX ?
BWWWWAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ! Are you trying to be deceptive or is it that you really did n't understand what you read ? It 's really pretty simple . The first link does not suggest that man arose in China . It is a discussion of a primate fossil . While humans are primates , all primates are not necessarily humans . The article discusses a primate fossil , the oldest yet discovered . It does not claim that mankind arose in China . Your second link leads to a discussion of well known human fossils from the middle pleistocene or later . None of them are as old at the Australopithecine fossils of Africa . Maybe you did n't read you own links , but I do n't see any claim of the origin of mankind in China . The claim is that early hominids ( Homo erectus ) migrated to China from Africa . The oldest H. erectus fossils are found in Africa and it would therefore seem that that is the origin of the species .
But the embryo is a mere clump of flesh inside of a woman 's body . Science proves it . It has no sign of intelligence , it is merely cells at this stage . Therefore , it can not be referred to as another person , or neighbor , and is no where near comparable to a human . Choices that harm another should be illegal , but choices regarding your own personal liberty and freedom should be made by the individual . Not the government .
While the current cannon was 'accepted ' by the late second century , there were numerous other 'gospels ' that existed by then , and were eliminated at the 4th century time frame . Most of those copies were destroyed , but some have been unearthed .
Ok , so are you saying that nucleotides are n't individually selectable ? Is that it ? Well , actually , they are . No , I 'm not saying that they are passed down separately or anything . Please do n't write your rebuttal before reading this post . What I 'm saying is that one nucleotide can make a difference in whether an organism survives or does not survive . For example , let 's consider penguins and the Galapagos . Now , it is a well known fact that the Galapagos were formed relatively recently . Before then , it is generally accepted that penguins were in Antarctica only . In Antarctica , penguins had plenty of feathers , enough to die when they progressed to the tropics . However , penguins also had variation in their feathers , so when a current brought them to the Galapagos , they quickly started to evolve . The few nucleotides that controlled feather thickness made a large difference to the survival of the penguins . In this case , they were important enough to make a difference easily . The DNA was inherited as a single unit , but some single units had single parts that made a difference .
The poster claimed no direct evidence for evolution had been observed . Just plain wrong . I gave you a `` new '' body part . A tail that can grasp .
80 % of all crimes are caused by one million violent gang members . Why are we allowing them to roam the streets freely ?
Well , there certainly is here with these cats , because they 're not actually inheriting a trait ; the symptoms are being independently induced in all the cats , parents and offspring , by denying them all particular nutrients .
Ah , the extra biblical myths make life so interesting . It 's full of # # # # , but it 's interesting never the less . What people wo n't do so they can justify their beliefs .
Actually , it does no such thing . It merely means a secular moralist must justify moral codes on the basis of their intrinsic rationality and real world consequences , rather than appealing to a deity as an arbitrary authority . Since all the scriptures of the world have been written by people , this moral authority represents nothing more than their personal opinions about what they think their god wants .
So evolution is anti-Biblical ? Yet at other times , your interchangeability allows you to say that evolution is not atheistic . Your clear interchangeability is what really causes me problems , but I can handle it .
I agree . That was the most pathetic , dishonest and downright idotic commentary on communism/socialism I 've ever encountered . I have a VERY hard time believing that someone could actually post that with a straight face . Good one Comrade Brian . Waxy
People like this guy , and Henry Hyde , Newt Gingrich , Robert Livingston , and so many others happen to be right wing republicans ... .is n't that peculiar ?
You really have a strange definition of faith . Scientific laws require reproducible results ( patterns ) . That 's how they got to be laws . I believe that the acceleration due to the gravity of the earth will have the same value tomorrow that it had yesterday because there is no indication that this pattern will change . It 's not because of faith , or at least certainly not due to the kind of faith required to believe in the supernatural . Your definition of faith sounds like an exercise in solipsim . I ca n't prove you are a human and not a computer so I have to have faith that you really are a human ( despite all the patterns I have built up in my brain over time . )
Although I 'm not keen on them describing things as living fossils ( the term is misleading ) the possibilities and implications of this are fascinating . I 'd be interested to see the paper if anyone has a PDF . It would seem to suggest that the origins of this particular molecule go back to the Ordovician at least , prior to the reptile/mammal split . Anyway , thought people might be interested
I believe Jesus is a role model for the human race . I believe he is a very powerful idea . But what I do NOT believe is that there was some dude with a beard running around Israel healing the blind and preaching about his God . So , in a sense , I do n't believe Jesus was a literal person in the ancient world , but more of a fable . Like Harry Potter is today .
Because ... ..
Over 100 Million dead in Germany , Russia and China .
It would n't . Altering any of the fundamental universal constants changes them all . We would n't be considering some small change here and small change there . The universe probably would n't exist in any form .
This is poor example . Focusing on saving lives over burying the dead does n't do anything to trump personal autonomy .
But mentally handicapped children are worth less than the rest of us ? You have to explain why some zygotes are inviolate and others are able to be aborted morally .
Seriously ? Well , I come here hoping for something resembling an intelligent discussion . Every once in a while I get one . Most of the time it 's just ramblings like Benjamin 's here . I was kind of hoping that by ignoring the trolls the stupid to interesting ratio might go down . Do you really enjoy the kind of `` debates '' that posts like this inevitably start ?
How would gay marriage undermine heterosexual marriage ?
Because of ? Hardly . I feel it does change the morality of it , but it is not the sole criteria .
So , are you saying that all athiest are evil and on the verge of self destruction ?
It is difficult to reconcile evolution with Christianity - as far as I see . Evolution excludes God .
Just do n't drop it in the shower !
Diversionary tactic . The point is that it 's harder to kill with the other weapons mentioned .
And when are we to expect the birth of the religion of dogs ? and of dolphins ? of whales and lions ?
Scientists at CSHL uncover new RNA processing mechanism and a class of previously unknown small RNAs
What you mean is that we should pretend that creationism has some sort of legitimate basis in reality ? The definitions were accurate . It would be different if someone could actually offer a scientific theory of creation . How about some evidence to support the `` theory . '' By the way , I 'm still waiting for you to tell us about how the definition of evolution has changed . What you really meant was the creationists had invented bogus definitions so that they could lump all of science under `` evolution , '' was n't it ?
I 'll give you that one ... only because I think by then women will be able to place their fertilized ovums in banks . But then again they said the same thing about robot servants and flying cars too !
So ?
Thanks , Christianity worships a blood thirsty God who is too wicked and morally bankrupt to worship . It is below me and I can not take authority from such a moral midget .
Your argument is moot . The Iraq population was n't heavily armed , only the Taliban and soldiers .
but they are still used , as long as the person itiis pointed at do n't know it is a bb gun it works too .
What I 'm saying is , if the police are going to abandon you , and the law prohibits you from protecting yourself with deadly force , what defense do you have should somebody decide that they 're going to victimize you ? Exactly what kind of qualifications are you going by in declaring a nation `` developed '' if the government is unable to protect you , and they 've actually made it a crime to try and protect yourself during your time of need ?
His point was criticism of people managing the numbers of their population with abortion . It also addresses the intentional overpopulation for the purpose of overwhelming declining populations .
Hmmm ... This is interesting ... If I am not mistaken , you are stating that [ you believe ] at least some physical creatures that occupy mass in the physical realm are actually part of a non-material realm . On what basis do you make this assertion ?
The fact that it 's the truth is why I keep repeating it .
The difference , Eddie is simply this . If the Constitution needs to be changed , the founders instigated a means to do so . Said means is doubly hard as to make sure what is done , has been given much thought and study . The plan afoot today by the Gun Grabbers is to incrementally usurp the rights of free men , until , the fait accompli has been established . If the Right to Keep and Bear Arms , or any of the other rights guaranteed by the Constitution are to be abridged , they must ne done so by legal means , i.e . constitutional amendment .
The guy sounds like he 's trying to make a political argument out of this so he can sell more books .
Hello , Nu Leader . Nor was the peppered moth example ever meant to `` prove '' evolution . One important part of the theory of evolution is the hypothesis that natural selection is the major driving force behind it . So , the peppered moth observations were meant to show that natural selection can have a significant effect on the relative frequency of genotypes . Incidentally , I am interested in your comment that natural selection is consistent with creationism . It was Darwin who first proposed that natural selection can be the major force driving the evolution of species . Creationists pretty much tried to discredit natural selection for over a century . It was only after scientific evidence was presented that showed decisively that natural selection was , indeed , a major contributor to evolution that creationists were finally forced to accept it . I would be interested in know who was the first creationist to finally accept that natural selection is a real phenomenon , and when they accepted it .
See above regarding the nature of proof . What other plausible explanation is there ? We have transitional fossils from so many strata between so many species , genetic markers in extant species indicating common ancestry - all life on earth dances to the common-descent beat . Yet you want us to make a special exception for humans , despite the exact same consillience between fossil evidence , genetic evidence , everything . You want us to hold in abeyance the conclusion that we share a common ancestor with the other apes , yet you can provide no remotely plausible alternative explanation . There comes a point where a thing not only looks like a duck and quacks like a duck , but swims , lays eggs , gets gang-raped by drakes and has 'DUCK ' tattooed on it in large , friendly letters . At which point , continuing to insist that there 's no proof it 's a duck is starting to sound just a little bit silly .
No , they are the same . God diliberately kept information fro them because He knew they would not understand , just like you would deliberately keep information not pertinent to you children because they will not understand . How we came about was n't as pertinent as why and who , so thats what He told us . It could kinda be like the stork . You know your kids wo n't understand ( and do n't yet need to ) about sex and child birth , so when your five year old comes up and asks where do babies come from SOME parents ( not all , I know I wo n't , but SOME do ) say that the stork brings babies . They put a myth in place of a fact that the children do n't need to know . Furthermore , even if God did explain evolution , if the men He explained it to did n't understand . Which they probably would n't have seeing as they had no sense of time , biology , genetics , or even basic anatomy ( all pertinent to evolution ) then they would have transcribed something VERY different . If God told them `` In the beginning I created the Heavens and the Earth in the first billion years , I said let there be light and I caused a tiny powerful ball of matter with an enormous mass to explode and with that came the heavens and the Earth . At first the Earth w '' Lets see primitive man wouldnt have understood 'billion years ' 'tiny ball of matter with an enormous mass ' 'explode . ' So what do we have left . `` In the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth , He said Let there be Light and there was . '' I know that is n't the Bible verse , but do you see my point . Even if God did n't as you say 'diliberately ' ( which in my opinion implies malice , but you may use that word in reference to God if you wish to do so ) keep the information from us . In the minds of man it could have been simplified enormously to a point of mythological proportions . A modern day example would be the theory of relativity . Have you ever had it explained to you . I have . It is extremely complicated and few people REALLY understand it . Anyway , when my father explained it to me when I was about 16 , we talked about it for several hours ( literally ) and through all his complicated explanations and answers to my questions , my brain pretty much reduced it to `` As you approach the speed of light time slows down compared to things not going that fast . But that does not mean when you slow back down you will not return to their same 'time . ' Time IS relative . '' Now I still do n't understand how time is relative or how time would slow down as you reach the speed of light , or even how you would return to their same 'time . ' I can simply regurgitate the facts . Man back then would n't have understand evolution so it would have been simplified similarly . Simplify it to just the facts , ignore the how and put it into a time frame that you can understand and thats good enough .
So , everyone who dies in a stabbing/beating/shooting is just , stupid ? Maybe they wanted to die ? Trust me , if there were alternatives to getting killed I do n't think many people would die of crime .
1 ) `` false impression by stating that a Christian Pastor believes that bigotry blocked Gay Marriage . '' 2 ) `` Had the title said , pro-gay pastor believes bigotry blocked gay marriage '' The only difference here being that you would want to label him as `` pro-gay '' and exclude `` Christian '' . By the same token , should we remove `` Christian '' and replace it `` anti-gay '' from any pastor that speaks against homosexuality ? Naw . Of course not . There is nothing dishonest about acknowledging he is a Christian . His statements should make it clear that he is pro-gay . Your dispute is pointless ...
Take the high road Ethmi , prove him wrong with the legislation itself . Bill number , name , text of the legislation , a link , etc . anything to prove it 's there and that he 's wrong .

You deserve to get insulted for the follwoing reasons : You post the same garbage at several forums You start thread after thread with the regurgiposted garbage at forum after forum You refuse to even try to understand the answers you are given , and when given answers , just ask more questions until the answerer grows tired of playing games You abandon threads only to start new ones on the same topics later Lather , rinse , repeat You do not want discussion . You do not want answers . YOu do not want to try to understand the things you read - look at your caterpiller color debacle . Your 'mission ' is to overwhgelm with volume because you know you lose on details . Trying to discuss things with you is like a hamster on a treadmill - it goes round and round and you end up right where you began . For crying outy loud , at CARM you have started yet another thread linking to the same Bruce Lipton website you did a couple of months ago , making the same basic claims as you did then .
In any private sale there is no paper record . As some others point out here , when you register to purchase a gun at a licensed dealer , the only information that the federal government recieves is the stuff for your background check , which must be destroyed . What these folks DONT realise , is that all firearms transfers made by licensed dealers are required bt BATF regulation to be recorded in the dealer `` bound book '' of firearm transfers . Federal law says they are required to keep these books forever , or if they fail to renew their FFL , they are required to send the bound book to the ATF . Also by federal law , they are required to make that bound book available to the ATF at any time , without a warrant , in order to facilitate the tracing of firearms . A nationwide datebase of firearm owners is already HERE . It is just fragmented into a bunch of smaller parts and kept by gun dealers instead of in a central database . All it would take is a trip o each gun stor , and they would have a list of everybody who has bought a gun from a licensed dealer . As far as police tracking black market guns , it does n't seem to work now , and I fai to see how they are going to do any better at it int he future . YOu are talking about something that can only really be detected by direct examination . A crate full of guns and a crate full of drill bits looks the same to an X ray . Guns don ; t have a specific odor that dogs can be trained to detect .
No . I will never allow `` the people of the country '' to tell me what is best for my my life or my health . To quote Jane Austen in Pride and Prejudice . `` I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . ''
Because activist judges in Mass made law instead of interpreting it and rammed it down the throats of the people and you can pretty much thank them for getting President Bush reelected ... ... ... ..
That 's the atheist worldview . And if you were a teacher , you could say that to students and the ACLU would n't sue .
Hello , Let me see , N.O.W . that 80 % Lesbian Lot ( by their own count and definition ) , continue to whine about women not being given 'equal rights ' , all the while , 51 % of the population ( that 's women ) own the MAJORITY of the wealth , represent the greatest number of teachers , have more rights on college campuses than their male counterparts , have more legal rights than men , are given legal custody of children-even when they are drug addicts/drunks/abusers , and are overwhelmingly the recipients of alimony ( regardless of their being no children in the marriage ) . Ah yes , the 'poor victims ' of all that male power . Women start professional careers later than men , yet demand the same amount of pay that their male counterparts , get , having spent years in the corporate trenches to achieve their status and pay grades . Women continue to whine about how they are victimized by men in the USA , despite the facts to the contrary . N.O.W . has n't bothered a peep about all the Muslim women in the world being beaten , maimed , and murdered , on a daily basis ; they 're too busy complaining that some unsuspecting woman heard a 'sexist ' joke while passing by a male counterpart 's office ( one guy telling another guy a joke ) . Yes indeed , poor 'oppressed ' American women . Whiners the lot of them ; never happy and wanting to make everyone around them just as unhappy . The bottom line is this : there is nothing between a woman 's legs , which is worth putting up with that , which is between her nose and her chin . And you can quote me on that ! Keep up the whining , I 'm sure the Muslim woman being beaten to death , clitorectomies being performed with rusted razor blades , and noses being cut off , wo n't bother you a bit ; you 've got a man in the office whom you wish to undermine , or a corporation you wish to sue , for some slight against your 'womanhood .

so you think it would be ok to fire people for being secular atheists ?
This is not what hospitals do with biomedical waste . They incinerate it . If these people are really doing this I can '' t imagine who the buyer is , and they are breaking many many laws .
Well , if my plane is already doomed as you say then what difference would it make ? Do n't you think this poll is leading ? It 's designed to give the answer that you want .
You should make opinions basedon God , not the way other people act . People can be right and still have annoying attitude .
Let 's see your best one ( 1 ) example . In the meantime , you can revel in this : What does the Bible say about abortion ? And if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she has a miscarriage , yet there is no further injury , he shall surely be fined as the womans husband may demand of him ; and he shall pay as the judges decide . But if there is further injury , then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life. ( Exodus 21:22-23 ) Straight from the Jewish Torah , God immediately affirms the value of human life in a mothers womb . Next , a divinely appointed prophet from the womb : Jeremiah 1:5  Before I formed you in the womb I knew you , before you were born I set you apart ; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations. Psalm 139:13  For you created my inmost being ; you knit me together in my mothers womb. Of course , the question here is : What divine insight does the pro-abortion crowd think they have to where they can destroy in a mothers womb that which God is somehow instrumental in creating ? That was a future prophet to the nations in the womb . But the pro-infanticide crowd wants to pretend that instead of a baby with a divine plan , its nothing more than an unviable tissue mass . Well , God is not fooled , and neither are we . Finally , every time you see another child playing and laughing , every time you see a boy or girl graduate , get married , have their own child , and so on , I hope you see that innocent little baby you had ripped from your body . I recommend you ask God / Christ to forgive you .
You mean a redneck U is banning guns ? XXX ?
I know very little about evolution , but I think that the half ape thing stems from the misconception that some people have that evolution means that humans are decended from apes , so our ancestor would be a half man/half ape . Instead , I believe that biologists think that apes and humans share a common ancestor , but our evolutionary paths diververged long ago . Please anyone feel free to argue/correct me , since I said , I am by no means an expert on evolution .
Yikes ! ! The phobes were right about same-sex marriage leading to polygamy ! ! ! : -P
So if a story in the bible is proven to be true , like the fact that there is enough water in the ice caps , and the atmosphere to cover the highest mountains , then these `` myths '' would become less rediculous ? Or would there be a logical explanation other than a higher life form did it ? Mayabe a crazy man built a big boat at the right time and happened to have two of each animal at the time ? But that would be crazy talk . Wouldnt it ?
So it 's just a coincidence that nations that ban guns like England have much lower levels of gun violence and murder than the US ? That 's kind of hard to believe . NYC was so effective in reducing crime that the mayor of NYC was invited to Mexico City to help them reduce crime there . So I do n't think the possibility that gun control has been effective in cities like NYC can be ruled out . You may be confusing cause and effect . You would n't walk into a hospital and declare that because there are a lot of sick people in a hospital that hospitals do n't help people get better . That website starts off with the rumor that there are over 20,000 gun laws . Although this claim has been repeated numerous times by anti gun-control activists , has anybody been able to verify this claim ? A recent study that counted the number of gun laws found `` only 300 relevant federal and state laws regarding the manufacture , design , sale , purchase , or possession of guns . '' http : //releases.usnewswire.com/GetRelease.asp ? id=12007 Another reason not to put too must trust in biased websites that cherry pick the facts .
A direct reply to a post on this thread . Youd better have your morning coffee .
And those who respect themselves and others do n't need that book of morality .
We can not prove the existence of God for , by definition , he dwells in a reality outside our own . Similarly , I can not prove the existence of a Flying Shoe in Hyperspace , nor can I disprove it , but I can prove that the Flying Shoe does not exist in our world because it exists , by definition , in Hyperspace . I can make up anything I want and say it exists in another universe . A round square , a colorless green idea that sleeps furiously , you name it .
So what 's wrong with the lineages provided ? Define `` melding '' .
Because you know the peer review process is biased . Anything submitted for peer review with a recognizable name like Dembski or Behe will be automatically rejected before the first word is read . The scientific communitys problems are just that big .
Reading Difficulties , huh ? There 's a cure for that . It 's called school . Perhaps you should go there ... ..
Thanks for clearing that up Mutz . I 've always known that putting every living species on the earth in one boat is a heckuva lot easier to believe than those foolish fossils . I 'm just gald someone else said it .
That crime fighting tool senario you just described is REALLY REALLY spooky . They way our justice system works is : 1 ) crime is commited 2 ) suspects are considered 3 ) evidence against one suspect builds and is arrested 4 ) suspect is given a fair trial with all the evidence present to a judge and jurry . In our system of justice , collection of evidence is PROHIBITED by the 4th Amendment without probable cause . There is no crime , thus no exuse to collect evidence . Citizens are also protected by giving any evidence against thier will by the 5th Amendment . This collected evidence will be used against suspects without thier permission . The crime fighting tool you just described violates 2 rights in one sweep . That is a very scary power given to police .
You are a known anti-gun supporter , should we really be surprised at your presidential choice . Funny thing is , you are going to get screwed just like the rest of us if Obama wins . He might try to take our guns away , but your rights that are important to you wont be very far behind .
Oh , THANK YOU MATT ! You just effectively shot down every argument I had in the 'indoctrinate our children ' thread . See if I stick up for YOU publicly anymore . btw ... it 's s-e-d-u-c-e
How many of the 14 were actually killed ?
Sooooo ? What do you think about the Senator 's stance on guns ? and her concealed hangun ?
No . Evolution is a scientific study of the evidence of how life changes . Evolutionary theory offers falsifiable explanations of how that works . Creationism is religious in that it is based on no evidence . It is based on mythology .
I disagree , I need you to show me what part of reason is BASED on faith of a rational creator , based on evidence ( includes things that are self-evident ) . Unless you want me to accept your claim on faith ! ! -Mach
What part of.. 'On the other hand , not one acceptable reason for individuals owning guns is mentioned . ' are you having trouble with ? Only a gullible fool , such as yourself , would lend blind allegiance , and obedience , to a 'world ' body that seeks to usurp the sovereignty of individual nations . That 's why you are indeed a LIBERAL .
I 'm talking about the woman , of course . The fetus does not have a positive right to suck nutrients out of the woman 's body against her will .
But again , the cost is worth it , just as it is with straight couples , as it will benefit gay couples in the same ways . It will mean better employee health and job satisfaction and increased productivity for the gay employees just as it will for the straight employees .
And , Master Shake , why is it precisely that you are having problems with `` women 's issues '' ?
But we were n't discussing either monkies or hell . One can only wonder at your thought processes that makes such irrelevant and disconnected thoughts pop up .
What ? You did a poll ?
This explains it Archangel http : //www.landoverbaptist.org/news0 ... yingdinos.html I do not understand how the marsupials and monotremes either suvived the flood or if they where taken on ark how they got back over 10000 miles to Australia across the ocean . Unless noah dropped them off . That must have been some powerful motor he had on the arc to beable to travel over 10000 miles and back in 40 days . Then there are the tortasis , lizards and birds on the galapagos , what about the turkeys , and buffalos in north america ? Unless ofcorse you now want to make the argument that God saved the animals in certain places or there was more then one noah . One noah on each continent . Then again that is not biblical is it ?
Thanks for the link , Emclean .
Well , gee , there 've been so many posts on this thread already ... My first post genius .
Simone , are you so out of it that you ca n't comprehend that I said exactly that in my post ? Note the bolded if you will .
You are missing the entire point ( again ) . Why do you feel ashamed ? Because you know that what you did is bad . I have heard from a great Australian war hero , one of our remaining ANZACs soliders ( recently passed away I think ) that we he stabbed the enemy soldier with the spike thing on the end of their gun ( WWI era ) and he saw him die that it was `` the worst feeling that a human can possibly endure '' . He said that that image will haunt him for the rest of his life . He knows that he did something wrong , but it was a war , and unfortuantely that kind of thing will happen . You are way off the plot . But let us continue .
Note that only male offspring are mentioned . The modern oath supports pro-choice more , imo .
Wrong and wrong .
Actually , there are three different definitions of biological evolution . Each of them is understood by biologists in its context without any need to elaborate . Each of these definitions are , of course , distinct and separate from other definitions of the word . For example , your definition # 1 is n't one of those definitions . Even though you begin with a claim about honest definitions of biological evolution , your first definitions is n't one of them . It is , in fact , more like the Victorian definition of the word than what it has come to mean today , and certainly not relevant to any biological definition . Your definition # 1 is the reason that Darwin objected when the term was applied to his theories . It is n't what Darwin had in mind and it is n't what a biologist or anyone who understands biology means , even today . Either you do n't know what you are talking about ( most likely ) or you are trying to raise a straw man ( dishonest ) . Of course , any fool can see that your definition # 2 is circular . Stating that evolution is an evolutionary process does n't actually define anything . While you object to embedding some undefined metaphysical postulate in a definition , you apparently do n't have an objection to embedding the word itself in its own definition . Would you like to learn about the meanings that biologists assign to the word evolution ?
And why should I care ?
Really ? What book is that , because I have seen no quotes or links to any source of any info at all from you anywhere above on this page . So once again accipiter , what in the world are you referring to ? You and the obvious child oughta get along fine since you both offer nothing more substantial than personal attacks which are based on your own warped beliefs and corrupted interpretations of that which you disagree with . Here 's my original post again , I challenge you to explain how these alleged stone age sheep herders whom you scoff at and mock described contemporary living creatures which paleontologists today identify as dinosaurs , from skeletal remains ?
The right to have a choice IS a legal issue . We do n't live in russia Women in this country have the same rights as men .
Yes it would have , because it would imply that God needed help to create us .
New York mayor Bloomberg broke the law by sending undercover agents on sting operations outside of his state of jurisdiction to get the evidence necessary to sue 19 out of state licensed firearms dealers . What he did was illegal , and the ATF threatened to tear him a new one if he did n't stop it . Bloomberg broke the law for his own personal crusade . Are you happy about that ? Or are you going to take the chicken way out and claim that a public official must be allowed to break the law to address crime in his territory ?
Too broad a generalization . I 'm sure most people who believe in evolution do n't chant `` god of the gaps '' .
Does the baby mentally exist ? Is it a person ? I need more info .

Could you perhaps define `` teleology '' as you understand it and say why you believe there is teleology in the universe ?
What about other 'rational ' alternatives to your version of evolution ; such as that postulated by ID theorists ?
And there is that disingenuousness on display ! The dissenting Justices would never propose the use of a alternate , subjectively interpreted standard of scrutiny to be applied for any other right deemed `` individual '' expressly secured by a provision of the Bill of Rights ( Stevens especially and even for rights NOT enumerated ) . The dissents refuse to consider the incongruousness of saying that , `` based on our precedent and todays opinions , to which . . . the entire Court subscribes '' the 2nd Amendment , `` protects an individual righti.e. , one that is separately possessed , and may be separately enforced '' and then argue that , `` When each word in the text is given full effect , the Amendment is most naturally read to secure to the people a right to use and possess arms in conjunction with service in a well-regulated militia . '' Say what ? ? ? ? The leftist dissenters , while acknowledging the Court 's history of unwavering `` individual right '' conclusions , revert to their old statist ( but invalid ) theories when explaining their unconstitutional , philosophically bankrupt positions .
Genesis 1:12 `` The land produced vegetation : plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds . '' Genesis 1:21 `` So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems , according to their kinds , and every winged bird according to its kind . '' Genesis 1:25 `` God made the wild animals according to their kinds , the livestock according to their kinds , and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds . '' Genesis 2:21-23 `` So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep ; and while he was sleeping , he took one of the man 's ribs and closed up the place with flesh . Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man , and he brought her to the man . The man said , `` This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh ; she shall be called 'woman , ' for she was taken out of man . '' How do you explain these verses ?
I 'm sorry , I did n't mean to imply that because you are male , you should n't have an opinion.. I just meant that how can you know so much about what a woman should do if you will never be in that kind of situation ? I do understand that biologically a fetus is a human being . I 've never contested that . I do n't necessarily agree with abortion in all cases , at all.. I do know that sometimes it medically becomes the only realistic option to the mother . ( I 've been through that ) . But in cases where the woman uses what I think are trivial reasons , such as they do n't want to lose their figure , or they have to much to do before they have a child , I do n't agree with it . A lot of my aquaintances have done it for those reasons , and that seems really irresponsible to me ... In my opinion , it should be made an option for medical reasons , not the little trivial reasons like my friends used.. but even then to me it does n't seem right ... After what I just went through , I got a first hand look at how horrible it really is , and even though I knew that medically that was the only choice , morally and emotionally it still does n't seem like it should have been that way . Maybe it 's because I did n't want to do it , but knew I had to , as opposed to someone choosing to have it done , but I almost wish it had n't been an option , because then you do n't have to make that choice . It 's a very hard thing to deal with , no matter what the reasons behind it , and knowing you ca n't change it.. but I do know if something like this happens again , it wo n't be an option to me , no matter how many doctors tell me otherwise . Again , I do apologize for the misunderstanding.. I did n't mean to say it that way , and yes I think men have rights and should have opinions too !
Actually Batman did carry and use a gun in the early comics , and he also killed the villains sometimes .
Nonsense . Name the holes and what parts are conjecture ? The parts that are conjecture are never , ever taught in a high school biology class . There is n't time . Only major points are covered about which there is no doubt .
Well , you know what happens when they try to eliminate waste . The opponents start screaming that the government is `` rationing '' health care . In any case the inclusion of the 40 million uninsured wil be financed mostly by waste elimination . At least it is a start . The status quo is untenable . The essential point here is that the universal healthcare systems in Europe , Japan and Canada deliver MORE healthcare for less money . It is not the case that in Canada , healtcare is in short supply because the government is rationing it . They are ahead of us in all metrics except waiting time for non-essential surgery . One example is the waiting time in emergency rooms as some of us have actually experienced . We may not be able to achieve the same efficiency overnight but we have to stop putting our head in the sand .
** Our darwinist-descriptor word of the day -- '' hebetudinous '' .
But in all reality an embryo is inside a uterus , living solely through a placenta and a two month old baby is not . That is a significant difference . One may argue how significant , but it is silly to say the only difference is time .
Ironic , since your `` Out of China '' post was basically the same as this post . You even claim you had no debate point , you were just posting `` information '' . It was n't until you claimed that evolution relied on those two mutual theories that we proceeded to debate . Maybe this young 13 year old christian is just following in your golden footsteps ... you might give them a little leeway if you , yourself , do this as well . Or are you above the rules of the average forum participant ? Hmmm . -Mach
The question is : To what degree do wars cull out particular genes as opposed to ideas ? Another thing to consider is not who is getting killed , but who is being born . Unless , something is done about the niche , it will just get filled again by whoever was decimated . Compare : Germans ( hypothetically ) settling in the Ukraine versus the US bombing of Hiroshima ( which was not then settled by the US ) . Consistent genetic pressure is really key .
So then , you think that the threat of criminalizing abortion will decrease sexual activity . In earlied posts you condemned wome 's `` lust '' . We gather that you think sexuality is a BAD thing . Why ? Are you the avatar of either Saul of Tarsus or Augustine of Hippo ?
Now there is some persuasive debating .
And that refutes what I said ... .. How ? Come up with your own original material for a change .
Oh dear ; where do I even start ? Ok , look , the ToE does n't say that the possibility was ever there for random mutation to suddenly make wings appear out of nowhere . It just does n't . The evolution of something as complex as a wing proceeds by a lot of intermediate steps , each one of them being useful , or at least associated with something useful . We do n't see humans or dogs or alligators suddenly sprouting wings because that would require massive wholesale genomic , and probably epigenetic , change . What we do see are more mundane , less drastic variations which can accumulate over time . It 's tempting to think `` wings evolving from arms ; huh , what about the millions of years when they were neither ; how could they have been 'fittest ' ? '' The mistake there is in visualising a straightforward morph from 'then ' to 'now ' , as if the organism knew where it was headed . A better way to imagine it is via an intermediate stage where the arms were still useful as arms , but also conferred an aerodynamic advantage , such as we see in flying squirrels today . If the original purpose of the arms later becomes less important , those features can atrophy while improved aerodynamic qualities remain strongly selected . The divergence of mice and bats is likely to have followed just such a pattern ; who knows , in another ten million years we might see descendents of flying squirrels that are as adept in the air as bats are today . So in a sense , 'flying squirrels ' are your answer . I ca n't guarantee they 'll evolve more and more wing-like structures over the next few million years , but it 's possible .

if God , even a non-biblical God , existed , then would you say that he would have always existed ? wouldnt this God be the same and consistent throughout eternity ? so far , we agree that the existence of a documented/biblical God can not be proven . an undocumented/non-biblical God has never even been encountered , not even in the last 5000 years when the other Gods were being written about . if this God had the ability to make himself known at his perogative , why would he not do so until now ? and if he doesnt show himself/make his existence known now why would he wait until later ? we could extrapolate this forever , and this undocumented/non-biblical God would never `` choose to '' manifest . therefore , the existence of such a God can never be proven the same applies for 3. if such a God never `` decides to '' manifest his presence , then even if he exists it would be of absolutely no consequence to mankind at all

What are you talking about ? Please define information . What does `` new '' information have to do with natural selection or evolution ? Evolution is NOT defined by evolutionary biologists as an increase in information . So I ask again , please define information in a meaningful way as it applies to DNA and the genome of an organism .
Oh I quite agree . Unfortunately , not everyone is able to see it as such . I was admitting to those who do n't that it does appear that God confirms their homosexual prejudices . To back Traveler up however , I do n't buy the 'closet case ' answer myself . People who are racist are n't secretly scared they are black , equally homophobes are n't necessarily closet homosexuals . Unfortunately such irrational prejudices just exist .

Well , no , it does n't . That 's sort of the point of the article I linked to . No organismic response , no hypermutable state ( apart from one coincidentally arising in a minority of the adaptive population ) , no EAM . L & amp ; D , as an experiment , had its limitations , namely the lethality of the selective environment . What the article I linked to demonstrates is that Cairns & amp ; Foster also has limitations . Most of the time , it should be remembered , the C & amp ; F methodology yields the same results as L & amp ; D ; the circumstances yielding the anomalous results that were a temporary shot-in-the-arm for Lamarckism were very particular . The bacteria had to possess a leaky allele that still operated at a low efficiency , and that functionality had to be just barely inhibited by scavenger cells . C & amp ; F still did something useful : it highlighted the potential importance of amplification mutagenesis , where genes that do a slightly useful job accumulate under selection , increasing the chances that a more successful variant of the gene will arise within any given population . I 'll check out the other experiment you mention ; thanks for clearing that up .
YES ! ! Go South Dakota ! !

Some creationists would probably think he 's a genius . Unfortunately for him , that 's not exactly something to brag about . This example was used on IIDB and shows the dichotomy with which SS 's views conflict with reality : Polar bears are birthed in temperate climates all the time , thanks to zoos . Do they revert back to the fur color of a brown bear ? No . Instead , SS finds a picture of dirty polar bear cubs and says , `` Look , brown ! '' Another good simple counterargument is that superspeed adaptation would prevent anything from dying due to extreme conditions at birth . Maybe SS would like to take his chihuahua to Antarctica to birthe its puppies and see if they even live , let alone look like Siberian huskies .
Sure we are . Creationism vs all the sciences ( including the biological Theory of Evolution ) and reality .
Go on .
Well then prove it to be BS .
No it 's not . There never was a Noahs ark . There was nothing to be found . The Jews ripped the story off from the Sumerian story of Gilgamesh . The bible contains nothing more than half-truths and comic-book science . If the entire Earth was covered by water as the `` story '' suggests , then where did all of that extra water go ? Oh wait that 's right , even though the Earth is a closed biosphere , according to delusional religious pawns like grizzly6626 the water must have been vacuumed up by space aliens for use on their own planet , or maybe noah snapped his fingers and it just magically disappeared . LOL grizzly6626 , if you were half as smart as you 'think ' you are then you 'd realize that if there were that much water covering the surface of the Earth then the atmosphere would have become inhabitable . Oops ... guess faith and fact do n't mix ? LOL Only a fool would believe what the the bible says about `` Noah was 600 years old when the floodwaters came on the earth . '' Here is a more simplistic explaination . Enjoy

You seem to have trouble creating working links . Here is a corrected link to your quote . Darwin , Charles . On the Origin of Species - 6th Edition . Chapter 1 - Variation Under Domestication . Do a find on , `` Hence it must be assumed '' to see the quote in context . Your intent might be misinterpreted by some who have not read `` Origin '' and are unfamiliar with Darwin thoughts . To the uninformed , your claim about what Darwin said could easily be misinterpreted to mean that even accidental changes to the environment by man that cause evolutionary change in populations is `` artificial selection . '' Of course , you could n't have meant that , since that is clearly not what Darwin was talking about . The context of the quote that you cite makes that clear . The whole context of the quote is in the chapter on Variation Under Domestication . Darwin does not discuss accidental changes to the environment in that chapter . That certainly would be more confusing than profitable in a chapter in which Darwin was attempting to explain the basics of his theory with examples from domestic animals , especially pigeons . It is abundantly clear that Darwin was referring to the selection by man of breeding stock since he remarks that in the domestication of a species man `` ... intentionally or by chance picked out ... '' characteristics . Of course , by use of the word `` chance '' , Darwin meant characteristics that existed in the individuals of the breeding stock that were selected for other reasons , i.e. , intentionally .
Uh , it is , is n't it ?
Well , to be `` scientific '' means that it must be falsifiable . Otherwise it is meaningless in a regime of methodological naturalism .
No Matthew , we all read it . The fact that you have specific targets in mind for your attacks changes nothing ; what everyone says still applies . Please , please , give up this appproach . You 're only hurting those you claim to want to help .

... The scandal in involving the Catholic priests ?
Well then , have at it . The theme of the day was weddings . Almost everything taught that day , except for this one story , was about heterosexual marriage . Go on , show us your argument against teaching kids about how this society organizes familes . Your opposition to this , homo- or heterosexual , is so obviously contrived . School is there to help socialize children and instruct them in how to be good members of this society , AND YOU KNOW IT . The idea that you would prefer them to ignore discussions of family -- while you simultaneously assert that this society rests on the family and tradition -- is ludicrous . Come on , jyoshu , you do n't have to argue this one ... we wo n't tell your supervisor .
But then , again , one 's body is more than merel proerty . certainly , you can prevent the use of your body even if it leads to death , and as such , if the mere property arguemnt was pertinent , we would be able to rstrict the use of property regardless . So the analogy does n't work .
Because the NY Times , CNN , ABC , Dan Rather , and Handgun Control are all atheist-lead and anti-Christianity . Yeah .
I think this is the crux of our disagreement . In my line of reasoning , I believe since criminals are obviously using firearms , the refusal to allow lawful citizens the same means of defense is unreasonable and unfair . Good people are required to `` bring a knife to a gunfight '' . ( i.e . disproportionate response ) While I believe that any law abiding citizen should be able to have access to the means to defend themselves , I think a reasonable compromise is possible between our two sides . How 's this : Instead of a complete ban , you concede that civilian gun ownership is a good thing and allow the reasonable ownership of handguns for personal protection . Instead of lassiz ' faire `` guns for all who want them '' , I 'll concede that a strict regimen of licencing and training/qualification for those who wish to purchase . ( In the U.K . Although this is reasonable , I 'm not going for it in the U.S . This would be a HUGE concession to government control here . ) A strict licencing/registration scheme would be allowing for MORE freedom in the U.K . It would be tightening a `` Nazi-like '' noose around our necks here in the U.S . If you are being burned at the stake , lethal injection sounds like a wonderful alternative . If you are walking down the sidewalk , it 's not quite as peachy .

Deliberate deception would be putting million year old dinosaur bones on a thousand year old planet . Even more deceiving would be putting vast amounts of oil here as well which takes millions of years to create . I would put the stars in the sky in the same category as this in terms of deception . The stars could be more of a cosmetic thing as far as God is concerned . He could have just added them to our sky without concern for whether it made sense or not . I personally would n't fault him for this .
Great way of twisting what I said . Would you like a Snickers bar ?
But we also do n't know that evolution is true - it is a belief system about the past that requires faith for it to have any reason . Your first part is already false ( proved above ) .

So the `` black codes '' of the South was n't enough evidence for you ? The neonazi organizations , even with Hitler long dead , are still a racist , white supremacist , kill any minority you do n't like , organization . Time has n't changed them one bit from one the original nazi party stood for . If time has n't changed the nazis , of the KKK , why would time change what gun control was all about ; keeping blacks from being able to be truly free ?

Wait , an ad hominem that even skews the stats ? You could at least compare monthly to monthly , or yearly to yearly . You could point out that his modifications decreased his energy consumption . You could tell us whether that number included time while renovations were taking place , if you even knew . You could clarify whether this compensates for natural gas , propane , or heating oil usage . You could explain whether the amount `` burned through '' is from the grid alone or also includes the non-impacting solar and geothermal contributions . But doing so would require not being a rightwing parrot .
Well , I did not choose to be heterosexual , I was born heterosexual . I can not see why it should be different for Gay people

this is totally false . the laws of logic being absolute does nothing to support a case for god . in fact , everything the bible tells us about god 's nature indicates that god is illogical , unpredictable , unreliable and irreplicable . this is totally the opposite of logic
** The darwinian notion has had no payoff . The fact of evolution , as descent with modification from one or a few common ancestors , predates darwin by hundreds of years , and is not the private property of materialism/mechanism/darwinism . The real `` payoffs come from 2 sources -- the understanding of inheritance that grew out of Mendel 's inheritance theory , and the concept of dynamic systemic 'adaptation ' , as opposed to passive particulate 'selection ' , in evoltion . Have to go now .

Yes , the article said it succinctly and I felt no real need to expand on it . Also , one extra point had to do with the second article on how he has been inflicted on the citizens of Johnson County despite their vote against him , which shows the pettiness of him and the Republican party .
You seem to forget we already tried this standard . And it 's for this reason that the 14th Amendment came into existence ; because allowing local communities to disregard the constitution on the basis that it did n't apply to them , was a massive failure and outright racist .
That is the premise of my question . On what basis can one claim that the Constitution makes this arbitrary designation with respect to the death penalty ? I simply do n't see any rational argument for it .
Let me pose a hypothetical question . Same scenario as yours above but instead there is a genetically normal zygote on one table or on the other table , there is a mentally retarded newborn baby ... which one will you choose if you had 2 seconds to choose ? You see life is existant at both stages , at the single cell and the newborn baby , but our view ( sometimes ignorance , sometimes selfishness ) is why we choose what we choose . So do tell me which one you will choose ?

I did n't say anything about anyone 'breaking the law . ' I 'm just showing you a different perspective of the events from a witness -- you know , giving you MORE information from which to draw conclusions . Or did you only WANT your information limited to one version of the story , mainly from the account of the one who got booted ? ? I think it was simply a private screening , and the people running the private screening did n't want them there . That 's their prerogative , as it was obviously a private screening and that 's the way it works . Again , read the comments on the blog I linked to as they include comments from people who were there , including more from Stuart and at least one by PZ Myers himself .
You have done it again .
Maybe you 'd be happier living in a moslem nation like Iran or with the Taliban .
I agree with you to some extent . First , the Mr. Hayes was convicted of this crime before the Lautenberg Amendment was passed . Secondly , Virginian law ( where the case originates from ) makes no distinction between a domestic relationship ( that which he was tried and convicted of ) and between the agressor . Quote majority ruling : A domestic relationship , although it must be established beyond a reasonable doubt in a §922 ( g ) ( 9 ) firearms possession prosecution , need not be a defining element of the predicate offense . Pp . 413 . Bulldung . If congress wanted to make it simpler they would have just said battery instead of domestic violence . How the heck they came up with that is beyond me . They basically expanded the meaning of the Lautenberg Amendment , which is a big NO NO ! I think that is what Justice Roberts was saying in his dissent . Quote Justice Roberts dissent : That reading does not require the specified domestic relationship in clause ( ii ) to be an element of the predicate misdemeanor statute . Individuals convicted under generic use-of-force statutes containing no reference to domestic violence would there-fore be subject to prosecution under §922 ( g ) ( 9 ) . ... . The majority also points out that interpreting commit-ted by to modify the use of force would render the wordcommitted superfluous . That may be so , but as shown , reading committed by to modify offense has its own flaws . All this goes to show that the statute is not an example of elegant syntax under either reading . The majority properly acknowledges that , under its view , the statutory language reflects less-than-meticulous drafting and syntactical awkwardness ,  and is not a model of the careful drafters art. Ante , at 6 , 12 , 13 . I am willing to acknowledge the same with respect to my reading . But I conclude from such reciprocal shortcomings that the text is at least ambiguous . Which is why this law needs to be rewritten . There is a lot more , but I find the majority decision hard to believe . It just does n't make sense ( well to me that is . ) BTW , this by no means I support Domestic Violent offenders , etc . On the contrary , I believe they should lose their gun rights if convicted of domestic violence , BUT , this decision is wrong . The pieces do not fit together . That is Mr. Hayes was convicted of battery , not domestic violence . The government screwed up , so he should be walking free right now .
You mean in the Bible alone . There are thousands of others .
A woman 's right to choose to keep her legs together is not in any way abridged by this bill . Ho , ho , f***ing ho .

LOL . Well that 's so nice of the copy who let you know . And that 's very interesting -- `` every time '' -- Archangel . How many times have you been stopped ? And for going how fast ? I 'm sure it was a lot more than 35 mph ! And you have the nerve to talk about `` responsibility '' or how this woman was a jerk ? Or to call me names ? Dearest , I never speed because I take my responsibilities as a citizen so seriously , and i have never received a speeding ticket . Were you driving under the influence as well ? How many lives did you put at risk , Archangel ? What pomposity ! What hypocrisy !

And as already shown ... `` Scientism , in the strong sense , is the self-annihilating view that only scientific claims are meaningful , which is not a scientific claim and hence , if true , not meaningful . '' http : //skepdic.com/scientism.html Scientism and Objectivism are from the sins of pride ; that man can know everything . It was the first sin ; the first temptation of Adam + EVe . There is no logic to the belief that man can know everything . How can it be believed when 'everything ' is not yet known ; there could be things found that man will never be able to determine what they are .

And they would be correct .
No . It 's not . Speciation has been observed . After two lines of organisms are separated for millions of years , they are no longer able to interbreed . Oh , I forgot . You think the earth is only a few thousand years old because your mythology that you believe by faith tells you that .

But I do n't see a problem . I do see a problem with proposing that God is something 'other ' , something special . I have a brain , which is a real physical object . I also have a mind , which is an abstract thing the true nature of which can not yet be ascertained , but I do not believe that it is the result of anything other than the fantastical complexity of the brain . If the physical structure of the universe is equivalent to a brain , then 'God ' is the mind , but he/she/it is only a product of the universe 's fantastical complexity , and not the creator .
You are repeating some more sensational hogwash and creating a false delimma yourself . You still have n't learned this is a REPUBLIC and not a democratic society ? You ignore the Rule of Law . Just as King George ignored the Declaration of Independence at his own peril you disgrace the FF of this Republic . Tell us exactly where that `` quote came from , who said it and under what context '' . He is a political animal which you are attempting to copy and not fooling anyone here although you attempt to disinfranchise some of the timid on this board for exercising their 2A rights . Now why would you abuse the 1A when you have attempted to create a false delimma already about the 2A ? Your Progessive/socialist/commie leanings are showing again . He praised Mao as a dictator and tried to demonize people who are pro 2A from keeping and bearing arms as the true masters in our political system .
I see myself as just as capable of swinging from being responsibile , safe and trustworthy into irresponsible , dangerous and untrustworthy . I believe every humans possess the ability to to do so , but not nessesarily through the involvement of firearms . Although i must reiterate the words `` responsibility , dangerous and trustworthy '' are entire being of a subjective , circumstantial situation .
You your qualifications in logic allow you to judge that ? I suspect that you are talking out of your elbow since I have n't seen any evidence that you know what logic is . Mostly I see hysteria and superstition in your posts .

`` 4 JUSTICE STEVENS criticizes us for discussing the prologue last . Post , at 8 . But if a prologue can be used only to clarify an ambiguous operative provision , surely the first step must be to determine whether the operative provision is ambiguous . It might be argued , we suppose , that the prologue itself should be one of the factors that go into the determination of whether the operative provision is ambiguous & # 8212 ; but that would cause the prologue to be used to produce ambiguity rather than just to resolve it . In any event , even if we considered the prologue along with the operative provision we would reach the same result we do today , since ( as we explain ) our interpretation of & # 8220 ; the right of the people to keep and bear arms & # 8221 ; furthers the purpose of an effective militia no less than ( indeed , more than ) the dissent & # 8217 ; s interpretation . See infra , at 26 & # 8211 ; 27 . 5 JUSTICE STEVENS is of course correct , post , at 10 , that the right to assemble can not be exercised alone , but it is still an individual right , and not one conditioned upon membership in some defined & # 8220 ; assembly , & # 8221 ; as he contends the right to bear arms is conditioned upon membership in a defined militia .

Last time I checked , it was a debate about religion and evolution co-existing . Not a debate about Creationism vs. `` science '' and `` reality '' .
In reverse ? The scientific method begins with an observation . Then an hypothesis is proposed that will explain the observation . Then a prediction is made that must be true as a consequence , if the prediction is correct . Then methods are devised to test the prediction . What is described in the paper is the last step . Majerus already has his hypothesis and his prediction and is accumulating the data that will support them .
Oh , really ? Does that mean that pesticides will be OK on marijuana plants ? NO .
Just as you have a background in science Frog , I also have an extensive background in Christianity . A brief synopsis : starting at birth I was without consent given the supposed `` gift '' of Catholic faith . In highschool I met a kid and later on a girlfirend who were both Born Again Christians . I thought I 'd dabble in it . The girlfirend and I went our seperate ways , but I remained a Christian and began studying the Bible . The transformations in me were mostly bad and far beyond the scope of this ( we can discuss it on a different forum ) , but one important thing occured when I began studying the Bible in earnest . I found holes and flaws too big to be ignored . Do n't ask me what they were because , again , this is not the religious forum and I 'd be hard pressed to even tell you what they were , but I assure you there was a time I could quote them chapter and verse . Since that time I have tried my best to forget it . I realized that my error was the attempt to literally interpret the Bible . I knew that if I pulled back from that , attempting instead to decipher the good message of the scriptures , I could perhaps save my Christian faith . But I did n't want to become an apologist . So , in my mind I travelled east . I dabbled in Taoism and Buddhism which appealed very much to my love of Asian history . After a year or two of this , when I discovered there was also a strict theology behind these Asian religions , and it was not just a matter of reading Thomas Merton , meditating and burning incense , I realized that I had been acting like a rich divorced woman with much too much time on her hands ( Think of the British sitcom `` Absolutely Fabulous '' -- - greatest show of all time after Seinfeld ) , and that if you 're really goign to commit yourself to something you need to do more than scratch the surface . It was then , when all religious answers seemed to elude me , that I subscribed to agnosticism : athiesm with a parachute as my old English professor used to say . And on that note I remain today . I do n't know the answer and therefore will not comment . Through all of it , however , one philosophy has given me freedom : the beginning of wisdom can be found in the notion that we do n't have the answers . Do you say I have the answers because men wrote them in a book nearly 2000 years ago , and I can take their word for it ? Hell , Frog , I do n't take the word of a man who writes the answers in a book today , let alone 2000 years ago . I open the newspaper always skeptical . If you tell me something , you 'd better be able to support it . Now what I do believe is an entire scientific community which can back up their claims , publish them and open up their work for anyone else in the world with the means to duplicate these tests ( or subject a hypothesis to a different test of their own design ) . The problem with the Bible is that its primary source of evidence is the Bible . A bad comparison , but a comparison nonetheless would be my writing a book and telling you that book is the truth because I say so . Exceprts from the Bible which may point to actual historical events or documented figures do not by rote prove that Jesus walked on water . I call Bible-thumpers mindless because this has been my experience , Frog . Up close and personal . They think inside the very tiny box of their scriptures and ask that we accept it by faith . But the basis by which we 're really accepting it is widescale social acceptance . If enough people , enough books , enough teachers point to this single source and say `` it is truth , '' then the cud-chewing masses will usually fall in line . But that does n't necessarily mean I am going to buy it . I would prefer listening to people , books and teachers who point to many different sources and say this is truth . If I want to see evidence of the Bible I can read the Bible . If I want to see evidence of evolution I can visit our excellent museum of natural history here in Pittsburgh . If I want to discuss evidence of the Bible I can talk to someone who has read the Bible . If I want to discuss evidence of evolutoin I can talk to someone who has read books from many different disciplines of scientific thought . If I want to challenge myself with new questions about the Bible I can open the Bible . If I want to challenge myself with new questions about evolution I can go outside , take a walk in the woods , scribble in my notebook and come back to this forum with a 47 page post full of questions : the important point here being that others like Lurch and Demon would either be able to answer them or point me in the right direction of someone who can .

That sounds like an honest answer . How did you feel about it at the time ? How do you feel about it now ? Just trying to educate myself more . Huck
Well , the unborn qualifies for this ... so we can conclude , using YOUR logic , that the unborn ... from conception on ... .is , in fact , a human being . You can remove the foot from your mouth now .
No , they 're not .
You 've made a point yes , but you have n't refuted anything . Every time something comes up you ca n't answer , you simply ignore it , and bring out another claim , which we then refute , you ignore ... .etc .
Why do you find it necessary to fit observations to Genesis ? or why it makes perfect sense to design creatures that resemble humans but have them evolve from things that look like apes ? and so on ? Are you saying that mankind is the original goal of evolution ?
Since you ask nicely , the answer is `` Supreme soveriegn authority '' , i.e . the fact that governments are established among men to secure their basic rights -- i.e . they not left to individual whims to respect or violate as each pleases , in the model of classic anarchy . States are thus delegated by their People , with the power to to protect these rights through laws . I believe we 've gone over this before ; you did n't understand it then , I doubt you will now ... or ever . It 's still true , however : ignorance is never disproof . If you form your own nation , you can name yourself the sovereign and construe the laws however you choose ; however that 's neither here nor there .
Yep . This is why he posts the same stuff over and over and over on as many forums as he can .

But you have challenged science with your beliefs . You argue against science with your beliefs , based on mythology with no evidential support . You argue against real science so that you can cling to your fairy tales .
The only mind you need to know in this particular thread is your own . The only awareness you need concern yourself with to answer the question `` what does it take to change YOUR mind on abortion ? '' Is Yours . Please treat the question and this thread ( indeed this forum ) with some consideration for those who take the time to start a thread to explore a specific question or topic . Please ?

On Faith : The Killing of George Tiller : A `` Pro-life '' Murder ? - Susan Brooks Thistlethwaite Murder is murder and abortion is not , to steal a phrase from Rabbi Arthur Waskow :
And why is that ?
Agreed ... . there is nothing over at MORI about it . Perhaps Horizon will elaborate tonight .
SO we are sticking with the now defamed `` collective right theory '' As of yet you have not explained : How the people in the 2nd amendment differ from the people in the other amendments . why the government would put a bill of rights that pertained to `` the people '' in all the other amendments but somehow saw the need to write one for themselves in the 2nd . Ill keep it to 2 for now
But you do n't like intellectual property and consign it to non-existence .
i disagree . being heterosexual does not mean you are sexually attractive to every female you come into contact with . you have a set of criteria that you use to determine which female is sexy . most boys ( depending on how they are taught ) are not sexually attracted to their sisters , mothers or females in their immediate family , regardless of how good-looking they are . yet they would be attracted to another female with the same body type and features . how do you explain that ?
so first you tell me `` how are they intefering by letting them do as they wish '' How are they letting them do as they wish when there are restrictions ? then you say `` sadly yes people should be able to make their own decisions without a nanny state '' am I the only one that does n't get that ?
SP : Hello again . I hope you are well . God is difficult to define . One would not expect a finite being such as myself to define clearly and completely an infinite being such as God . However , as with any person God has defined himself . We all definie or identify , ourselves by various methods . What we like and dislike . What we do , where we go , where we have been . God has done this as well in the bible . He has mades statements about the things he likes and dislikes ( The ten commandments for instance ) . He tells what he does ( he is a creator for instance , He loves , he has mercy and grace . ) He tells us where he has been ( He is the God that is , was , and will be , in otherwords exists outside of time ) . There are other things naturally . I can tell you some because as a finite being I will take a life time getting to know him . This is true with any person . You can not completely define your closest and dearest friend . It is impossible because people are infinitely complex . You can know your friend none the less . This is true of God as well . You have heard me talk about God on this forum for quite sometime . This is how God is defined . You ask an impossibly broad question . Sglaine seems to imply that theists will only hamper you with illogic when it comes to defining God and they will eventually say they do n't know . I know some not all . So do you . This is right . To assume that we should be able to define God completely and accurately is illogical .
Really ? 'cuss what I always see with anti-choicers is that they seem to think that the pregnant woman is invisible . This means that all men and all fetuses have a right to life at all times , but women , for some unknown reason , seem to lose that right when they become pregnant . Weird .
As I have pointed out , the only BS here is your accusations .
Tip : The wealthy of the world would like nothing more than the general populace to believe the meek and humble will survive . It always benefits them to have a tranquil , humble , meek , flock to make them even more rich and powerful . Once a pawn , forever a pawn . Dont ' be a pawn . God helps those who help themselves , is n't that some religious saying ? -Mach
And what if it is one to me ? Then your refute is equally refuted . The support for us not knowing lies in you and other 's inability to provide anything beyond speculation as support for the assertion that an unborn child is not a person . Your own inability is my support .
Oh , it 's politics ! [ Slapping forehead with hand ] What was I thinking ? ? If I find any KKK members are against relaxing drug laws , I guess I 'd better change my view and start opposing drug laws . And if I happen to find that there are KKK members who do n't mind U.S. involvement in the UN , I 'll be sure and oppose any U.S. involvement in the U.N . I wonder if any of them have parents on medicare ? Doh ! ! Guess I better oppose any form of socialized healthcare !
an unbreakable rock can not exist , simply because its illogical , not because of God 's will . as long as something is classified as a rock , or any other solid for that matter , it can break . in the same way God can not create a round square . then again , God can set limits on himself , in that he can create a situation that he himself can not revoke . in a way it is similar to the hard rock question . for instance , God can not undo his word . if he says something will happen , or never happen , then it can never be undone . according to genesis , one of the things God can not do is destroy the earth by water . in this sense , here is something God can not do . by God 's own declarations he limits his possible actions . but it doesnt make him less than omnipotent . he still possesses the ABILITY to destroy the earth by global flood , but he can not because he can not lie , and for every declaration he makes , its one more thing he can not do
And you 're quite naive if you think that emotional examples mean anything against the facts . The so-called `` Partial Birth '' Abortion is quite rare and usually only performed to save the mother 's life , but now they 're going to have to let the mother die because Dubya has banned this now thus the first step to going back to the `` good old days '' when women were nothing more than property . You 're the sick one . Also , with your resorting to such tactics shows that you are losing . BTW , is n't putting `` Your god '' under your name somewhat sacrilegious by putting yourself above your god ? I guess that I 'll be seeing you in Hell .
Comments about asexual reproduction are not relevant . The statement is true , and again one of Darwin 's observations . The later part of the statement is a reference to a popular evolutionary philosophy during the latter half of the 19th century , essentialism . Except for creationists , essentialism was debunked and cast aside during the years of the synthesis .
So , are you saying your friends do n't deserve to live because they have no morals ? I hope you do n't blame the parents for the kids lack of judgement . They really have no excuse . There are , I am sure , many good families that have raised criminals . One of the things that mark maturity is not blaming your parents for your downfalls . So are you saying that a person that is unloved in their youth would have been better off not having a shot at life ? If you are please consider : My Mom and Dad had the abortion appointment set up . That 's how unwanted I was . Do you think I do n't have a right to life ? That I was better served not being able to give life a go ? My sister was divorced ( for lack of a better word ) from her parents , are you saying because they treated her poor she was better off not being ? A lousy beginning in life does not mean that a person 's whole life will be worthless or unhappy . have a nice day , heidi
I do not believe it . The sources cited by the pro-freedom movement are footnoted INDEPENDENT studies.. Your link states : '' An analysis conducted by The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence '' This was biased and faked at best ... . Show me ... .. DC Survey says ! XXX Show me ... . Baltimore ! ! ! , Survey says ! XXX ! They do n't give links to thier data ( pro-freedom sites do ) , They do n't even break it down by state ! This whole campaign is based on an emotional response of Brady 's wife ... Show me ... independent study ! Survey says ! XXX !
The Christian community DOES have a split on the issue . Not all Christians believe gays should be the target of Christian homophobic attacks and discriminatory legislative efforts .
Actually there was .
`` cave men '' did not leave hieroglyphs , unless you want to call ancient Egyptians cave men . The first drawings in caves were found by Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola in 1879 .
What laws are these that you speak of ? Kindly provide the bill name and number so you have some actual proof and are n't simply parroting from the fear-mongering Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center . During World War II the American people rounded up Japanese-Americans and herded them into concentration camps because you were at war with the people of Japan and thought that they were the sleeping enemy even though they had no proof . What you 're speaking of is no different than this . The way I see it Brady , your hatred for guns and gun owners is so overwhelming and logic defying , that you 'd be perfectly alright with unleashing a life-ending pandemic plague on the people of earth if you believed it would put an end to all gun owners everywhere .
Oh , the dichotomous world . I almost envy your ignorant bliss . Everything so simple , so categorized , so neat and organized ... ... . and then there 's the real world . The real world is n't made of dichotomies like whore who should pay for her sins vs. innocent pure-hearted baby victim . Good/evil , god/devil , white/black ... blah , blah , blah ...
Thank you for repeating me .
Actually , I do n't ask how the idea occurred . As I mentioned , Darwin suggested it . I 'm not sure what the rese of that paragraph means .
Yes , a creationist bible ministry site . They do such a poor job in trying to report science . But of course their purpose is n't to report science but to report evidence that casts doubt on scientific theory . You see , the people at AIG agree to reject any scientific data the contradicts their religious dogma . They know the answers from mythology and are trying to make science fit around it . They do n't actually do any science themselves .
Can we get away from quoting 5 year old posts ? Seriously , if you do n't take the time to actually read the thread why should I respond to your post ?
Actually its 14 billion years . Hovind is not claiming what science does .
Perhaps the screen name gives me the impression that all his/her posts will be tongue-in-cheek or outright lies ! As for the apparent drug usage , I 'd say it 's more likely LSD than crack . A person on crack usually sells their computer !
The anti-abortionists claim a load of **** on many issues . I do n't listen to them . To put the `` life '' of an unfertilized egg above that of a person is grotesquely sick IMO . I support any such stem cell research wholeheartedly .
Yes yes , this was all covered in Wells ' previous book , Icons of Evolution . It has been refuted numerous times ( some even on this forum ) . See here for a thorough debunking .
What is your non-violent way of stopping a felon with a knife ? A felon who at 30 has spent 10 years in prison and was raped by other prisoners ? I suspect you will do what most New Yorkers will do when they witness a crime : NOT GET INVOLVED ! I will stop carrying a pistol when life is rosy . What else do you do to protect yourself besides being concerned ?
Actually , all evolutionists must have faith for their theory to be true . Can you prove that the big bang happened 15 billion years ago ? No , all the evidence that we have in favour is the red shift of starlight and the background microwave radiation ( which is all at the same temperature , give or take a few K ) . We all know how evolutionists interpret the evidence , but the evidence makes just as much more sense when interpreted through Dr Humphreys ' new young earth relativistic cosmology model . This is outlined in his book `` Starlight and Time '' and is an amazing read . So the same evidence ( e.g . redshift , CBM radiation ) makes sense in both models ( although CBM causes a little trouble in the big bang theory ) . But we have no human eye witness accounts of the big bang or even creation unfolding . Nor we can observe life coming from lifeless chemicals , nor we can observe life going from simple to complex - today we observe mutations and natural selection going in the opposite direction . Basically , no one was there to see the supposed evolution of all things . We have no eye witness accounts of any of these events , they certainly can not be repeated or experimented upon today . This means that the evolutionist must take his belief in evolution by faith as he can not prove that it happened here today in the present .
It shows by the way , only the creator of life can take it away according to the Bible .
You mean `` here 's '' .
Hi Boopee . I do n't know what to say . Never thought I 'd be compared to Hitler . Yikes ! Um , well , ya . So , I guess if you 're interested , I 'll give some reasons why I 'm against abortion . Here 's some links to articles about it on Boundless ( a webzine ) . ( if you want to , just go to www.boundless.org and type abortion into the search bar ) http : //www.boundless.org/2001/regula ... /a0000567.html http : //www.boundless.org/2000/features/a0000229.html http : //www.boundless.org/2000/features/a0000230.html ( read this , if no others ) I oppose abortion because ... . a ) I beleive the unborn is a valuable human being , and therfore abortion is murder b ) I beleive that abortion hurts women ( see links ) Yah , those are the basic reasons .
Well , my daughter cut her chin ( in the U.S. ) , which required some stitches . My wife arrived to the emergency room with my daughter around 6:30 PM . We did not come back home until after midnight .
Can you not understand `` Our Primate Ancestors '' arose in China . The article suggests that previous theories were Afro-centric . `` Could it be that the entire story of primate and human evolution was like watching the movie `` Out of Africa '' over and over , with every major transition in primate evolution occurring on that continent ? '' Are you using 'ancestral with the spin that ancestor may not be anything other than archaic ? Or are you suggesting that they arose in China , then moved back to Africa ? Because the article says `` Carnegie palaeontologist Chris Beard tells how he made the scientific and political choices governing his selection of fossil research sites , and what it 's like to discover a very early rung on the ladder of human evolution . '' Which suggests that they were an actual ancestor . By the way , you do the same bwaahhaa as Iamthetruth . An indication of the level of which you wish to 'discuss ' things . ( Could it be that you have two IDs on this post ? ) . Sorry if that seems ad hominem , but it 's less so that your remarks .
So the concept of homosexuality did not exist in the Bible days . . . You know , I cant remember being addressed by someone willing to make such an idiotic statement . Please forgive if this side is a little short on words . . . Have you read the story about Sodom and Gomorrah ?
yes . and in the `` middle-ages '' roughly 80-90 % of the world believed in superstition , black-magic , and myths . knowledge based on facts do not change , but such built on unproven and untestable believe usually does
That is an incorrect statement . Viability seems to be the topic that gets little mention here . Humanity , consciousness , personhood , sentience , etc . are all extremely debatable , as has been demonstrated , sometimes ad nauseam . But viability outside another human being is a clearly distinct difference between a zygote and a new-born baby .
They have . Prey animals have their eyes to the sides of their heads which allows them to see in every direction , almost 360 degrees around . Predator animals have their both eyes facing forward .
As others pointed out , this is a misconception . I have little doubt that the great majority of pro-choice people are quite positive about wanted pregnancies . I suspect that this misconseption comes from the fact that almost all abortion discussions are about pregnancies that are not wanted . Pregnancies that are wanted are almost never discussed since they are not relevant to an abortion debate . After all , who would want to abort a fetus if they wanted to be pregnant and have a baby ( excluding rare cases of risk of mother 's death , severely deformed fetus , etc . ) ?
Sure , , , ,I have more than a few that was purchased from a individual , , , ,no registration , license , no paperwork.I hand him the money and he hands me the gun.All legal and absolutley no paper trail . As far as guns purchased from a licensed dealer , all that is documented is the info for a background check , And by law that info must be destroyed within , I think 90 days . Kind of puts a snag in the whole confiscation idea , ,ehhhh ?
There also is n't a single peer reviewed piece of evidence proving a link between me and my ancestors . So what 's your point ? Are you suggesting I have no ancestors ? How absurd .
Because naturally the man should be responsible to pay for it ... one way or another , to support it ... and her in marraige , or provide child support , as provided in the law ... he did the deed , and must be made to pay.. The idea is that if men are held responsible for abortions , then they will put on a condom instead of taking the chance , ... and hence.. reduce the abortions or the need there of , and this would incourage them to marry .
And you remind me of the people in the year 1900 who said man would never be able to build a flying machine .
Well if their reasoning has n't sunk in by now Anyways I 'm pro-choice and pro-death penalty . I do believe in individual responsibility which is why I 'm pro-choice for males as well . What 's your argument ?
Those abortions that are perpetrated as `` birth control '' should be outlawed .
But ... .but ... .I thought these weapons were used solely to kill large amounts of people ? Can anyone explain to me why we have to ban `` assault weapons '' because they are only designed to mow people down like blades of grass , yet we need to issue the same `` assault weapons '' to our police for their safety ? If they are used solely to kill large amounts of people indiscriminately , why do our police need them , unless it 's to kill large amounts of people indiscriminately ? How can you argue they ARE NOT needed , yet argue that they ARE needed ? Which is it ? Please explain yet another instance of anti-gun `` doublespeak '' .
I feel a No True Scotsman coming on . Should I even bother to mention Hovind ?
Might be something to be said for that . Are there any studies that show possible causes of suicide ?
Amen mekayla , and welcome to the forum . Now prepare for the ensuing hate speech which is sure to come from the pro death and infanticide advocates who are sure to attack you for daring to share your common sense and compassionate opinion .
** Which is true , [ see above ] , but which is nothing to be ashamed of , since it applies to anyone , including myself , who feels motivated to debate philosophy . And although many darwinists kid themselves that they are here to debate 'science ' , they are not . They are here to defend their metaphysics and its place in their personal psychological identity , i.e. , ego , against the metaphysics of others , just like everybody else . What is so very strange and unnatural , IMHO , about many materialist/mechanist/positivist/darwinist/atheists is that they will go to great lengths to deny that that is the worldview that their ego revolves around , and will always attempt to convince themselves and others that they are actually somebody else . Somebody utterly uninfluenced , psychologically , by any worldview , any metaphysic , any particular set of unconscious assumptions and prejudgements , at all . The rest of us are proud of the intellectual sub-strate upon which our opinions are based , be those opinions open to challenge or not . So why are materialist/mechanist/darwinists so often ashamed of being identified as such ? Beats me .
So does this mean they have to get tougher on gun control or softer before the results go their way ? That is the real question . My guess is that we are caught in the unhappy medium where going in either direction will be more successful than where we are now .
No it does n't . Because you limit beneficial mutations to a single individual who must , in your eyes , be the biggest and strongest or it wo n't be passed on . Would n't it be better to actually learn what you are talking about ? Still waiting for your support of creationism . I just know you have examined the evidence for your position with at least as much intensity . I 'm beginning to think that you do n't have evidence and you do n't have a theory .
Well lets see here lets take a little look here at what i found here at this website http : //www.eurowrc.org/06.contributi ... contrib.en.htm and this is what is says : `` Every minute in the United States , 1.3 adult women are raped ; 78 women are raped every hour ; 1,871 women are raped every day ; 56,916 women are raped every month ; 683,000 women are raped every year . ( Crime Victims Research and Treatment Center of the National Victim Center , 1992 ) . '' Now these women and teenagers that may have had a great life . They may have had a dream of becoming someone . They may be a good student at a good high school or college . They have been waiting all of their lives for . But ... But but but ... all of those dreams , goals , intentions , all shot down because some guy couldnt control his hormones and made them pregnant . Not only does that destroy you mentally . It also destroys you physically . They have to have this baby because they could not get an abortion and have that fetus , which was not their 's to want , could save a life of a person . They could save them from : cancer , bone thinning , organ failure etc . But no..no ... no ... no ... because people think that only teens are just fooling around and not thinking and having unprotected sex . They should make abortions illegal . Thats definatly not my opinion
Hey , dont give religion on public schools credit . At least crack tastes good .
It should , but between you me and the wall , you know it wo n't though .
What , I do n't understand how your analogies even work . Parelelle universes came from the big bang ? What ? [ quote ] Paralell universes is one of the theories to explain how the big bang was so perfect . Dark Energy Term had to be accurate to one 10 x 120^ . The way IT accomplished this is that there an infinite number of universes so one exactly like ours had to come about in a big bang just like the one science says happened . It also means some where there is a universe that you created by passing gas and in it you are a creationist and an Elvis Impersonator . If that makes sense to you then the avian lung problem makes sense to you as well .
From wikipedia : `` The phrase is a metaphor , not a scientific description ; and it is not generally used by biologists , who almost exclusively prefer to use the phrase 'natural selection ' . ''
The problem with this reasoning is that the criteria you 're refering to are n't a definition for life , they 're a set of guidelines , rules of thumb . They are n't meant to be applied to obviously living marcoscopic things like mules . Their purpose is to give biologists a common ground when discussing things on the microscopic scale . On that scale , where `` living '' is n't obvious , reproduction is one of the things biologists look for to decide if something should be called `` alive '' .
I still think there would be thousands of women taking the pill that aborts fetuses every year . I would expect several hundred to be caught .
And there are thousands upon thousands of experiments that back evolution . Clearly you have n't bothered to look at any of them . [ more creationist lies snipped for they are getting tedious ]
No , you need to read more carefully :
Again , how does this apply ?
Evolution completely contradicts with the God that you know ! Have we ever been able to explain ( scientifically ) the things that God has done ? Have we ever been able to explain hell , heaven , angels , miracles , etc . ? No . God is beyond our comprehension .
Once again , my point was that evolutionists contradict each other . One says A. was mostly bird , the other says mostly reptile . One says A. was a link , another says that A. could not have been a link .
Well not exactly , but it does come down to `` biblical creationism '' without the courage to admit that it is a son of `` biblical creationism '' . At least the biblical creationists ( YEC and OECs ) were sufficiently honest to identify their candidate for the creator/designer . IDers can not seem to recall who the designer might be - they like most laywers take the fifth amendment .
So when the sea and sky informs a sailor , how does it inform ?
And/or , that it must have been Almighty God himself who zapped that little DNA nucleotide , because we all know that beneficial mutations never occur naturally : - ) I liked this part , which is yet another link showing relatedness between humans and fish . Creationists just hate this kind of evidence .

I never said they would actually follow it all the time . I said that most would incorporate it ( referring to a world morality ) . Just because they would accept it does n't mean they would follow it . Maybe you should stop trying to tear down your little strawmen .
Or maybe it was his reaction to the outcome of Heller vs. DC , which resulted in the lowest number of homicides since 1966 . The facts are n't on your side , Brady . This is probably the only thing Obama ever did politically that I agree with .
lol you 're welcome
Would you mind telling us just how he determined ALL maladaptive or inconsequential mutations in his test organism and just how he validated such measurements ? To me as a biologist with quite a bit of microbiology under the belt it would seem to be impossible to do so ! After all its very likely that a fairly large portion of the populutaion will have at least one mutation at at least one base pair location in the total sequence ! Your claim would seem to be impossible , but perhaps there is a way he managed to do so .
Political leaders should not oppose gay marriage at all . But if a political leader is going to stomp around proclaiming that he wants to `` defend traditional marriage '' and promote `` family values '' by denying others the right to marry , the voters will not be happy if that political leader is discovered to be cheating on his wife . You seem to be suggesting that the arguments by political leaders in favor of `` traditional morality '' and `` family values '' are entirely meaningless and are just pandering to popular prejudices . That is just what the voters , I think , wo n't like about this ... ..that all the `` family values '' talk was nothing but political posturing to garner votes . Which it probably was .
So if I eat more , I 'll grow taller ?
Reversing a decision would occur at what you might call the `` law '' level . Amending the Constitution is at a different level , and so does n't count as a reversal .
And likewise , what category would you have for gays who do not exhibit `` gay behavior '' ? Celibate ?
Last time I checked , I was fairly human
Actually , Darwin did n't like the phrase `` survival of the fittest '' applied to his theory . The phrase was actually coined by sociologist Herbert Spencer in the statement of his social theories . Darwin 's preferred phrase was `` natural selection '' and used the phrase `` survival of the fittest '' only after it had become popular and Alfred Wallace ( a Christian turned spiritualist ) convinced Darwin that he would avoid confusion by using it . If one wants to reduce the hundreds of pages of theory that Darwin wrote to a single sound bite , `` differential reproductive success '' is probably the best . Further , natural selection was a proposed mechanism to explain the observed divergence of species . Darwin was quite aware of the implications of his theory for mankind from the beginning . He was also aware that it would be unpopular with the Church and the religious so he did n't mention it in On the Origin of Species . He waited until the theories expressed in that book had become generally accepted in the scientific community and then published The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex . In the later book Darwin did argue that mankind shared a common ancestor with apes .
Just because something is bad does n't mean you should fear it , because it 's easily avoidable .

Which are based on old information . The SOHO project ( with which I was indirectly involved , and know some of the participants ) was launched on December 2 , 1995 specifically to make high precision measurements of the sun , especially the oscillations of the size of the surface , which indicate details of the interior . To quote them : Is the Sun expanding or contracting , and at what rate ? ( For an overview of the controversy over solar diameter variations , I recommend John Gribbin 's pre-SOHO book , Blinded By the Light : The Secret Life of the Sun , published in 1991 ) The Sun is not currently expanding or contracting to any measurable extent . It may in fact be shrinking or swelling , but we have no hard data with which to conclude that . It is vibrating , however : http : //helios.tuc.noao.edu/helio.html ( Global Oscillation Network Group ) http : //soi.stanford.edu ( The Solar Oscillations Investigation ) In addition , we expect that the Sun will someday expand into a red giant phase , but that wo n't be for another 4 billion to 5 billion years or so . SOHO FAQ So , have you worked out the length of a day would have been 1 billion years ago ?
`` The use of Pepper Spray is legal for carrying by a person 18 years of age or older '' `` Some examples of misuse include ; spraying on people in anger , as a joke , possession of by prohibited persons ; minors , drug addicts or persons convicted of felonies . '' Do n't know where you got that . I was watching a reality TV show ( my DVR quit on me ) about court files . A CA jury sentenced a teenage girl to 22 years of hard time for stabbing a 47 year old man when he tried to rape her . Assuming this is true ( which it could not be due to the fact that its reality TV ) , how can the jury sleep at night ? The defense proved that the man often made violent sexual advances on women , and the 17 year old girl was not inherently violent . She was convicted on second degree murder and sentenced to the maximum possible amount of time . Seriously , this is one F*cked up state . I ca n't even believe something like that would happen in this day and age .
lol that 'll be the day
I was not calling them `` nudie pictures '' myself , but only describing what children talked about when I was a kid , and how these pictures could be interpretated . I myself used to look through `` You and Your Health '' books ( I 'm not sure if you 're aware of them , they were quite common in homes at a time though now they 're generally out-dated ) . They really did educate me on the human body and the parts of it , though I did enjoy mainly looking at the human reproductive organs , they were n't porno , but they were the next closest thing to it . And then I was able to go to school and amaze the guys by telling them stuff they did n't need to know about all the girl 's private parts . I will say again though what i said before , your son may be responsible for his age and you may feel that he 's ready to deal with such knowledge , but my reasons for saying so is that other children are not neccessarily ready for such things , and children do talk . They not only talk about things they find out with their classmates , but they 'll like to brag to younger siblings and their friends siblings , who may also really not be ready for such things . My younger brother 's main source for such information was always myself . Though i was n't suggesting to lie to your son about such things , but the possibility of a vague or ambiguous answer to the question . Ever see the movie Coneheads and their interpretation of a condom ? `` Earthling Bubblebum '' I 'm suggesting that without prior knowledge about what it is , it 's not very obvious about its use .
No kidding . What could POSSIBLY be more concrete ? As far as I can tell , she has never publicly made a statement specifically about the DC gun ban but since , as you pointed out , she DID say that no functioning democracy should allow private ownership of guns , I have trouble believing that she thinks the private citizens of DC should be allowed to own guns , UNLESS what she is saying is that since we own guns , we should move toward a monarchy or perhapse some kind of dictatorship . She did not , as far as I know , voice her opinion regarding private gun ownership in a totalitarian system .
Fundies do n't say do as I say , not as I do . We say do as God says , not as I do . There 's a huge difference .
Only 1 in 4 people in the U.S. own a gun . What if transferring a gun to a felon merited 5 years in prison . Do you think that might discourage `` straw purchases '' ?
If you beleive in evolution , then you are not a true Christian . God told us how he created us right in the bible . Evolution tells the exact opposite of that , so if you accept it , you deny God .
So you 're saying that a person 's right to defend themselves ends at the border of their state of residence ? How about a person 's First Amendment rights ? Should states be allowed to set limitations on free speech that 're radically different from your own home state ? Or how about driver 's licenses ? Should your license only be good in one state and one state only , and driving in a different state is a criminal offense ?
I dunno about that , but possibly . They do know that those afflicted with ADD have some unusual structures in their brains too . Last I heard they were investigating the causality of homosexuality with developmental deficencies in the brain . The jury is not out yet
Yes , prove it by science . I do n't want you to keep reverting to word games/sophistry ; philosophical arguments . You must prove it by science . Show me the scientific experiment that proves it . I 've asked you a number of times , and every time you 've failed to do so .
Is the suicide rate in Australia higher than other places ?
So funny ... Like others have pointed out , this dialogue has nothing to do with evolution . It 's a ridiculous story otherwise as well ... 1 . How many secular teachers talk about God in class ? I 've never had a teacher in any of the secular schools I went to say anything about God , for fear of the controversy it would create . Teachers live in fear of controversy , they do n't want to get fired . I think this idea that non-Christian teachers try to convince students that God does n't exist is a fundamentalist paranoid fantasy . 2 . How many atheists use the `` you ca n't see it so it does n't exist '' argument ? very few . They will use the `` there is no evidence so I do n't believe you '' argument , but that has nothing to do with whether Timmy can see teacher 's brain .
Incorrect . Following proper firearm safety procedures will reduce accidents to effectively zero .
I 've read your hate mail personally , and still have a copy -- worse than anything Bennett has said and it would get you banned if I ever turned it in ( though I wo n't because I 'm not that kind of person ) . You have no ground anymore to say anything about anyone saying anything hateful , or commenting on the credibility of others . It 's interesting that when some of you decide to attack the messenger , you assume it will automatically discount the message . No one ever said every single thing a speaker says has to be agreed with ; it 's part of dealing with issues to agree with some things and not others . Certainly I do n't agree with everything Bennett said , but some of it needs to be repeated . Based on what I 've seen and continue to see in the gay 'rights ' movement , he 's more on target about quite a few things than most of you would ever admit .
The problem lies in the choice of theory . Evolutionary theory is one of our strongest theories . It has bucket-loads of evidence to support it . It is very well understood . Gravitational theory however is a woefully weak theory . Beyond the facts that mass has no effect upon the rate of descent , we can send probes to Saturn 's moons using our knowledge of gravity and gravity effects time , we know next to diddly squat about it . We do not know how it works . It does n't even appear to work properly over large siatnces , the universe is expanding at the wrong rate according to our gravitational calculations , we invent dark matter and dark energy ( neithe rof which has been detected ) to explain gaping hole sin the theory and the entire theory is at odds with quantum theory . So why do n't Kansas shcools teach about alternate theories in physics classes when covering gravity ? The answer of course is simple : evolution is questioned to appease the religious fundamentalists that still hold your country to ransom by the balls . Do n't give me this nonsense about `` evolutionist zealots '' : they are simply scientists p***ed off with weak school boards cowering at the the first sign of the fundies getting upset over their kids being taught current scientific knowledge , rather than religious mythology , in science classes . ID is religious mythology . It has no evidence to support it . It is n't a scientific theory . It has no place in the science classroom .
So the stats come from John Lott ... . Was n't he the one who got caught making up statistics and impersonated a woman for three years to support the pro-gun cause ? http : //articles.latimes.com/2006/may ... on/oe-wiener31 http : //whoismaryrosh.com/ ... .a bizarre individual who I do n't think can be trusted .
Indeed . Many people do n't realize that the commandment is not `` thou shalt not kill , '' but `` thou shalt not murder . '' The important question then becomes , when is killing murder ? I have no doubt that God cares for the lives of fetuses . But I also have no doubt that God cares for the lives of pregnant women . The reason I brought up the Exodus passage is that it 's often taken to establish that abortion is murder , and that performing an abortion should be punished accordingly . But the passage is n't talking about abortion at all . Which just leaves us with the question of when it is or is n't acceptable to take a life , and the passage does n't provide guidance to that general question , either .
I think that this is my view of it all as well . A lot of the events of the bible ( mainly the old testament ) are things that might have occured in one form or another , and much of the events of the New Testament DID occur . An example of my view is that I think that the flood did happen . It all started as a very large flood ( probably in a river valley ) that was much larger than normal ( say a `` 500-year-flood '' or a larger discharge event ) , possibly destroying a bunch of dwellings and maybe killing a lot of people , but some surviving leading to the Noah character . Eventually over the millenia , it got distorted and blown well out of proportion until it became a flood that covered the entire world . Then it led to the Epic of Gilgmesh , which was then adopted by those writing the early books of the Bible under the form it is seen as today .
But , are n't you glad they nurtured you and sis ? My first memory , I think , was an occurrence at the age of 3 , maybe 4 . So , is it feasible that I was expendable up to that point ?

5 maybe 10 sentences lean a direction and you invalidate the whole article ? Good luck finding a news article that is completly objective and balanced
Different sciences . There are different spins on the data depending upon your socio-political background .
So , if one person says that `` Neo-darwinism '' is dead , and many people say that it is quite well supported by the evidence and show said evidence , we are supposed to believe the one ? By the way , I notice that they failed to provide the context for the statement , `` The 'modern synthesis ' is dead . '' Sound like a quote mine to you ? Oh , wait : are you saying that it is gaurenteed to be true because it contradicts the ToE ?

I think you do not know what you are talking about . Your description fits the matter `` god '' you belive in .
This is just pure intentional ignorance - you do realise Peddlar , that things can happen over time ? Not to mention that evolutionary hypothesis have been made and then tested - protein homology for one , there is no way anyone knew the answer before hand but what was observed later when technology improved is what was expected . DNA dating pretty much gives the same time for common ancestors as fossils do . There is really no difference between carrying out an experiment a fraction of a second in the past and observing it than millions of years - other than the latter makes it a little difficult to get all the evidence sometime .
Yes , but I think you missed my point . I stated this above , remember the prohabition ? People actually drank MORE alchohal . Without a ban , law abiding citizens and criminals will have them , with a ban , there will be just criminals .
Incorrectly by those who do n't understand evolution . Talking about the evolutionist theories about the big bang is pretty mindless , since the big bang is cosmology . Whether or not there was or was not a big bang is irrelevant to evolutionary biology . Lumping other sciences under `` evolution '' is a method of creationists so that they can claim that they do n't oppose `` science '' but only evolution . To be a creationist is to reject the last 400 years of science - cosmology , astronomy , astrophysics , nuclear physics , geology , paleontology , tectonics , biogeography , genetics , population genetics , and so on . You get the idea .
Actually no . And I 'd really want to go for the music . This is a quote from Bob Brozman , a great slide player that I 've seen a few times . Funny guy . The full quote is like this : `` I 'm so glad to be here in Europe where you still have freedom of speech . They 've taken that away from us . Remember that I come from a coutry where 40 % of the people do n't believe in evolution . And if you ever go to Texas ... there 's no evidence of any ! ''
Well , there are several problems with your post . 1 ) You misunderstand the term 'THEORY ' when applied to scientific theory 's . A theory is a model to try to explain the FACTS . WHen it comes to evolution , the theory of evolution is a model to try to explain the observed fact that evolution happens . Second of all , Humans and modern apes share the same ancestor . From a biological point of view , humans ARE apes that have a specialised brain . The third problem is many religious people take much of the bible as allegorical . That means they are able to reconcilate such things as scientific fact , ( evolution , expanding universe , age of the universe , biology , geology and physics ) , and their belief in God .
I can see why you might My apologies to chemists everywhere .
There is only one problem with your statement my friend , and it is a big one in my opinion . I 'll fix it ! If the bill of rights is n't legally binding , then the declaring of a law to be unconstitutional would never happen . There ! It looks correct now !
Yes , great post BradleyHarris ! well written , perceptive and insightful .
So the scumbag judge or judge and jury did a tremendous miscarriage of justice then . But this is off the topic . Its Black on Black gun crime , not judicial activism .
On the face of it , the implication is that this kind of thing happens all the time ; that everywhere you look , stress-induced hypermutation is occurring , and along with it adaptive mutations are occurring disproportionately often - that this is part and parcel of everyday evolution . The ardour with which this evidence is brandished is , however , misleading . In only a handful of studies , using specific strains of bacteria with specific genetic features under specific environmental circumstances , have specific adaptive mutations seemed to occur with anomalous frequency . There is no suggestion that these cases are in any way generally representative , and even if the results were being interpreted correctly , the idea that they constitute evidence for a pan-species mechanism of internally directed evolution is , unfortunately , wishful thinking . But what of these rare anomalous cases ? The most famous was reported by J. Cairns and P. L. Foster , in which a dish of starving , non-growing E-coli ( a particular strain with a Lac- mutation ) appeared to preferentially induce a reversion mutation ( to Lac+ ) in order to enable growth when the only source of energy was lactose . Moreover , the mutation did not occur with such frequency if lactose was not present , if there was another growth-inhibiting factor in play , or if food sources other than lactose were available . On top of that , although the adapted bacteria showed evidence of accumulating other non-selected mutations , it was nowhere near enough to explain the rate of adaptive mutation , and the bacteria which did n't adapt showed no accumulation of unselected mutations at all ! Understandably , this looked to them , and other people at the time , like a pretty cut'n'dried example of an environmentally-or-organismically induced adaptive mutation . However , the nagging problem remained that this event was completely unprecedented , and was not observed in the general case of bacteria under starvation conditions . Why was this strain of bacteria so good at inducing this particular reversion mutation in just those circumstances ? The answer , as it turned out , was that the experimental assumption of 'no growth ' taking place in the e-coli colony was in error . The strain of e-coli used in the experiment had a 'leaky ' ( inefficient ) mutant Lac allele , with only 1 % to 2 % of the normal ability to process lactose . That 1 % to 2 % was then deliberately 'smothered ' by the experimenters through the addition of scavenger cells which mopped up the product of what little lactose the e-coli could process , effectively halting their growth . Because the later , visible growing colonies of e-coli had a reversion mutation to lac+ , the experimenters deduced that mutation was required for growth to be possible . However , what they did not take into account at the time was that during normal growth prior to incubation on the test medium , a small proportion of the e-coli colony experienced a duplication of the leaky lac gene . This mutation conferred no advantage - until the colony was plated on lactose . Now , the second copy of the gene increased the total amount of lactose they could process beyond the ability of the scavenger cells to inhibit growth , and the e-coli could ( slowly ) grow and divide . Within these slow-growing microcolonies , selection favoured those cells which experienced further lac- duplications . And the more lac- duplications a cell has , the more likely one of them will experience a reversion mutation to lac+ , explaining the apparently anomalous frequency of that particular mutation . When this happens , cell growth rate jumps considerably - but now it is the additional lac- genes which are holding the organism back , destabilising the chromosome and tying up resources which could be more efficiently processed by the lac+ gene . Selection now favours those lac+ revertants who lose the unstable lac- duplications . By the time the microcolonies become visible to the naked eye , they consist almost entirely of lac+ revertants . This hypothesis agrees with all observations related to the earlier experiments , and was verified in a number of ways , including repeating the experiment with a colony composed entirely of duplicate lac- bacteria , increasing the number of microcolonies 100-fold , which tallies with the ~1 % background rate of chromosomal duplications in those bacteria . Also , bacteria in the late-arriving microcolonies were observed to possess residual duplicate lac- genes . In short , the results of the experiment agree completely with classical evolutionary theory . It should be noted , by the way , that in addition to the late-arriving 'directed mutation ' microcolonies that causes such a stir , the original experimenters also observed the expected number of early-appearing colonies from pre-plating revertant mutants , a la L & amp ; D. EDIT : Reading further around the subject , it seems no stress-induced hypermutable state was involved either . Apparently , 10-20 % of the bacteria with lac- duplications also possessed 'dinB ' ( a mutation-promoting gene apparently , though it 's beyond the scope of my research here ) on the same plasmid . The mutagen 'came along for the ride ' so to speak , as selection favoured the duplication of that section of DNA , and induced hgher rates of mutation in - yep - 10-20 % of the adaptive population . So not only was the hypermutational state of that subpopulation not the cause of the adaptive mutation ( clearly , since the other 80-90 % of adaptation happened without it ) , it was actually harmful . Live n learn ! 2ND EDIT : The same experiment yields similar results with lac- situated within the chromosome itself , only with 100-fold fewer colonies , reflecting the lower incidence of chromosomal duplication and reversion events in comparison with plasmids .
From wiki : During the Italian Campaign of 1943 and 1944 , 100,000 Free French soldiers fought on the Allied side , notably in the fighting on the Winter Line and Gustav Line . By the time of the Normandy Invasion , the Free French forces numbered more than 400,000 strong . 900 Free French paratroopers landed as part of the in the British Special Air Service Brigade ( S.A.S . ) ; the Free French 2nd Armoured Division , under General Leclerc , landed at Utah Beach in Normandy on 1 August 1944 , and eventually led the drive towards Paris , while the divisions which had been fighting in Italy became part of the French First Army , under General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny , and joined the U.S. 7th Army in Operation Dragoon . This operation was the Allied invasion of southern France . The Allied forces advanced up the line of the Rhône River to liberate the Vosges and southern Alsace . Are we good so far ? Again from wiki : The French Resistance played a valuable role in facilitating the Allies ' rapid advance through France following the invasion of Normandy on June 6 , 1944 , and Provence on August 15 , by providing military intelligence on the Atlantic Wall and Wehrmacht deployments and coordinating acts of sabotage on power , transport and telecommunications networks . As old Abe said you have removed all doubt !
So we do n't have influence over our soul ? How can we serve god with all our souls as it tells us in Deuteronomy 11:13 ? `And it hath been -- if thou hearken diligently unto My commands which I am commanding you to-day , to love Jehovah your God , and to serve Him with all your heart , and with all your soul -- or a few verses down where we place his words on our hearts and souls `And ye have placed these my words on your heart , and on your soul , and have bound them for a sign on your hand , and they have been for frontlets between your eyes ;

Just how do you suppose the government seeking permision would work in reality ? And what exactly are you afraid of ? It seems odd when people advocate blind trust for Joe Civilian , but then think that the government should n't be allowed to be armed . I think there must be a balance in trust given both ways .
For the final compilation , yes , but the vast majority , certainly the Gospels and the first few Pauline epistles , were widely accepted long before that , and were regarded as authoritative in the early 2nd century . By all means quibble about 2 Peter , Hebrews and Revelation but do n't try to claim the books of the Bible were selected politically in the 4th century , it simply does n't fit the facts .
Why do you expect me to provide evidence when you never do ? Quotes from your silly little book of fairytales do not qualify as evidence of anything but an over active imagination and your interpretation of said book leaves much to be desired . The words I have generously provided you above are in fact from my own book of fairytales and require no validation because its just common sense .
I believe it to be safe .
I believe that equality means equality of opportunity , not forced results . The firefighters in NE demonstrated that AA policies that punish fairness are unconstitutional , for instance .

More like put on `` leave with pay '' aka `` taxpayer funded holiday '' while the woman is charged with `` assaulting a police officer '' to try and cover their misdeeds . At least that seems to be the usual tact in 21st century america .
What did n't you learn in that class that we need to teach you ?
Well , that 's your claim , anyway . Truth is that billions of theists accept evolutionary theory as is and reject the standard ID arguments .
And these are going to be what are the ultimate questions from a fundy . These are the questions that prove , if an evolutionist ca n't explain them in detail , that it is some unknown , magical , supreme being that is responsible by some unknown , supernatural means .
There 's a simpler explanation here though .
You should watch where you cast stones , kido . Your original post is an example of a straw man ... not mine . You should be more careful before operating a gun ... you just yourself in the foot . LOL !
Oh , sorry , I did n't think that was a serious answer . Thanks .
Thanks , yes , I did catch myself on that one , and it is interesting to discover that the pagans charged the early Christians with Atheism . I like Tertullian and Justin Martyr 's `` Apology '' , and IMO , the style of rhectoric and the language is powerful .
The real dishonesty is in pretending that this church does n't believe in the Bible . Just because they do n't agree with YOUR interpretation of the bible does n't mean they do n't believe in the bible . We could look at `` women 's rights '' issues as well . The bible is quite explicit in how women should behave and what their role in society is . They are NOT to have positions of authority over men . NO women teachers . Women are to learn in silence and subservience . Can we declare that churches out there that do n't hold to these draconian measures as `` not believing in the bible '' ?
I believe you know my answer to that . But your question is moot . Please show me a 18 or 19 year old in high school who has all thier rights intact ( not a convicted criminal ) who wants to carry a gun to class . The short answer : I 'll care about the ban when it does violate the Constitution . Your not going to find anyone to challenge the law . Personally I will not carry a firearm to a highschool . That is my personal choice . The consequences to me if I screw up with a firearm are too great , at the same time I would not restrict any citizen who wants to do so . If I find the need to be at a highschool , I am hoping that a gunman is going to shoot a lot of kids before he shoots me . That is what happens to the rest of society when you stop people who want to carry firearms . The good people who want to carry , hope that a lot of other people are going to get shot first before it is thier turn . It does not even have to be a gun , it can be any weapon . A criminals weapon vs. a good citizens `` hope '' , criminals win .
Apparently this is a petition opposing the pending resolution before the Illinois lawmakers that will deprive the rights given in the Constitutions . It is to encourage the lawmakers to vote against it . The lawmakers have not yet agreed to vote it down . Knowing the State of Illinois , I am predicting they will pay no attention to the commoners . The only thing a glean out of this is that the common people have more sense than the lawmakers . But I 've actually known that for a long time .
Humans are about the furthest thing from perfect . The bible IS perfect , it 's flawless . You ca n't take anything from it and prove it to be incorrect . The only thing that even comes close is misinterpretations of certain sentences . I know plenty of people who do n't believe in any sort of God and are n't bothered by the thought that this is all they have , the only life they 'll ever live . Maybe some people need to believe in more to live more , but all people do n't .
http : //www.answersingenesis.org/home/Area/isd/jones.asp When Judge John Jones of Dover Pa. was considering evidence from persuasive evolutionists concerning what should be taught in schools , could it be that he `` hardly knew the field , and did n't have an answer '' that would fit the time constraints of his decision making ? Did judge John Jones know what was going on in this country 100 years ago ? Why ca n't today 's ID opposing evolutionists see the mistake religious people made 100 years ago , and be enlightened enough to be more open minded about trying to suppress ideas ? Maybe because human nature does n't improve over the generations - following the money always comes first .
More misunderstanding of evolutionary theory . This implies that evolution is some kind of progress . That idea is the reason that Darwin objected to the use of the word `` evolution '' in reference to his theory . Evolution is genetic change in populations over time .
Liberal , not Democrat . Believe it or not , there are pro-gun `` thinking '' Democrats .
See above .
The tautology argument is rooted in the Spencerian epithet for natural selection , `` survival of the fittest . '' Which organisms survive ? The fittest . Which are the fittest ? Those who survive . But of course , `` survival of the fittest '' is n't a very good statement of the theory of natural selection . Darwin did n't like it and only began using it due to the encouragement of Wallace after it had become popular . It first appeared in `` On The Origin Of Species '' in the 4th edition , and it was never used without an explicit reference to natural selection . I never saw natural selection as being in the slightest tautological before . I too have found natural selection to be painfully obvious . I see what you are saying , but I do n't actually see that as a tautology . Early on I learned that natural selection was differential reproductive success . Perhaps I had good teachers . In that light , natural selection is a statistical tendency for some genetic alleles to be passed along more than others . Once that concept was grasped , population genetics was a logical consequence .
What , pray , is a real answer ? Because , you know , if it is anything like a corrcect answer you are doing a rather poor job of it , mate .
So why not then cure AIDS ? And why are you playing upon the old Gay Aids myth ? once again not one point that is relevant to the questions I asked ... Your just shifting blame and scapegoating ...
Well , ok. You 're right . Now that I think about it , `` missing links '' and `` transitional fossils '' are n't really the same thing . All species are potentially transitional , in that if the line continues it will change eventually , maybe even split . But missing links are something different . It 's just a fossil that shows some relationship between other fossils and that 's really all .
So , how many times have you said this ? Also , does it appear to be working ?
Actually , no they could not find oil without evolution . It 's not only a matter of finding `` certain rocks '' associated with oil , but by reconstructing the paleo-environment . Only certain environments , indicated by types of rocks and the types of animals/plants that existed at that time , are suitable for the production of petroleum . In fact , a lot of mineral resources are located by certain geologic formations as interpreted by modern theories of geology . Without a knowledge of biological and geological evolution prospectors would waste a lot of time looking in the wrong places .
let me try to translate into words 1. if there is a god in this world , there is a god in all worlds 2. there being a god is a possibility 3 . If there 's a god in all worlds , there 's a god in this one 4 . There not being a god in all worlds implies that there 's is n't a god in any world ( all or nothing ) 5 . There is either a god in all worlds or there is n't a god in all worlds 6. from 4,5 there either is a god in all worlds or no god in any world 7. if there 's no god in this world then there 's not a god in all worlds 8 . There 's either a god in all worlds or there is no god in any world . 9 . Since god is a possibility we know the statement < there is no god in any world > is false . 10 . Since there 's a god in all worlds there 's a god in this one from 3 Is this the right interpretation ? If it is there is one flaw in it . # 9 is flawed . Just because there 's a possibility of a god does n't mean that there is a god in some world , just that there 's a possibility of him being in some world .
So ? You 're displaying the very rational as Animists . ID can be summed up in one phrase : Stuff Complex , Therefore God . If you accept ID , you must accept Animist , or you are a hypocrite .
Just a couple of points : First , I believe your characterization that it is the far-right that is seeking to limit third-term abortions is incorrect . There seems to be large support on these forums from both the pro-choice and the pro-life side regarding third trimester abortions . Likewise , the general public seems to have been so upset with the Supreme Courts decision in Stenburg that Congress stepped in and passed a nearly identical statute to the Nebraska law . That statute cleared the Senate with the support of 16 Democrats , and it cleared the House with the support of 63 Democrats . That is not to ignore the fact that it is largely Republicans that would go further than third trimester restrictions . I am merely trying to point out that Roe stands in the way of restrictions that we all support ( third trimester ) , and thus we all should hope for legal reform in this area . Secondly , the slippery slope argument is common , and I will address it in more detail later . My basic point is that if we really do think that third trimester fetuses have a significant moral status ( and I take people at their word on this ) , than we should work to reform abortion laws in the United States . And that reform , as I am trying to argue , must begin with the undermining of Roe v. Wade . Note that I have not yet discussed whether Roe v. Wade should be overturned . I do plan on discussing the legal issues with this case . But as of now , I am only trying to lay some groundwork for why that discussion is so important . A lot of people that I speak with seem to think the law is so technical that it can not be understood ( or is too hard to be understood ) , and thus they would rather not bother with it . So , I am trying to address that . And I am doing so by simply saying `` If one seriously wishes to restrict abortion in the third trimester ( which virtually everyone seems to ) , than one must seriously consider the legal aspects of the issue . ''
The maintenance of the integrity of the code is not dependent on selection , but dependent on internal variables ( feedback system ) for maintaining functional integrity . Again , showing another form of optimality . In article 10 : Fascinating research was conducted whereby a sundry of different unnatural amino acids with novel three and four base codons have been selectively incorporated ( engineered ) into proteins yielding viable organisms . An intriguing question arises from this research . It is easy to imagine these to arise through chance and selection ( e.g . amino acids with photoaffinity ) and then be incorporated into the standard code . Yet the code seems to remain stagnant . For billions of year after fixation , little evolution happened in the code . Why ? Did it arrive at a global optimum in a pre-existing fitness landscape , with a pre-existing fitness function ? Finally , Article 11 : The article cites many of the optimal properties above and concludes :

Actually , one could also cite the success of Chinese merchants all over the world , South Korean capitalists in the U.S. and quite a number of other non-Europeans around the world .

And , I 'd better not slight the Japanese in this discussion . I 'm not sure I approve of Hayek 's take on capitalism , though .

Why ? Statistical testing can not show something that is nonsensical to be either valid or invalid ( prayer in this case ) 1 . Why would god be random in his choices ?

And if the `` natural process of evolution '' is determined by humans in a university lab , many with an atheist worldview , that clash with something the Bible says , you and Kenneth Miller immediately toss the Bible out and accept what the humans say - no questions asked ?
Exactly . That the change in moth color was due to natural selection was first posed in about 1896 by J.W . Tutt . The funny thing is that as pollution increased , the moths turned black , and then as the pollution was cleaned up , they turned white again . carbonaria have become pretty scarce .
There is not one theory , but a great many to choose from . If you 're talking about the origins of life , many evolutionists believe in abiogenesis - that life somehow just came about out of non-life . Some will say that evolution and abiogenesis are two distinct theories , but there 's a lot of cross-over ; begun with Charles Darwin himself who postulated a primordial soup . Miller-Urey did experiments to try to concoct how life began in a primordial soup of their own design . They failed in essence to demonstrate how life could emerge from non-life through natural means . ( Many work on the philosophy that life came about and evolved through naturalistic , or materialistic processes ) It leads people such as Nobel-winner Francis Crick to come up with certain strange notions ; Panspermia , of which , his version just shifts the problem , rather than answers it . ( see below under PANSPERMIA ) Intelligent Design theorists suggest that some intelligence ; possibly , but not exclusively a deity is behind nature ; that nature seems to have an order . Some here too casually dismiss ID from science but the door 's already open to science SETI looks for ID Cryptographers do to Forensic scientists do THEORIES OF LIFE ... PANSPERMIA Panspermia is the idea that life came from outer space . As with all theories this too is not homogenous . There 's a general panspermia theory , and a 'directed ' panspermia theory . The former is a belief that life came here by random chance , such as on a meteor . The later is that life came here at the behest of an intelligence - such as aliens directing ships to earth laden with the molecules of life . One idea is that the building blocks of life  ... Bakes said nitrogenated aromatics exist throughout the Milky Way galaxy. http : //www.spacedaily.com/news/life-04zw.html `` Francis Crick also thinks that life on earth may have begun when aliens from another planet sent a rocket ship containing spores to seed the earth . This is no idle thought ; Crick first proposed it with chemist Leslie Orgel in 1973 in an article entitled `` Directed Panspermia '' in a professional science journal called Icarus . A decade later Crick wrote a book , Life Itself , reiterating the theory ; in a 1992 interview in Scientific American on the eve of the publication of his latest book , Crick reaffirmed that he things the theory is reasonable . '' ( Behe , M , `` Darwin 's Black Box '' , p238 ) which as I said , simply moves the problem to 'where did the aliens come from ? ' `` COMPLEXITY THEORY Stuart Kauffman , a theoretical biologist at the Sante Fe Institute , has put forth the idea that when the necessary elements of the cell formed in the primordial soup ( nucleotides , lipids , and amino acids ) , they were instantaneously integrated into a system , a system which we know as the cell ( Cohen , 1996 ) . Kauffman says this was not due to a miracle or chance , but was bound to occur . He rejects other scientists ' need to find some sort of genetic carrier like RNA or DNA , or even an aperiodic solid , saying that the life forms may have had no need for them . ( An aperiodic solid is one in which the atoms are arranged in some non-repeatable geometric pattern , such as a helix , that would allow for the variation within the structure that is necessary for genetic material ) . He believes that such genetic carriers could have evolved after the new life was already flourishing . Kauffman has even designed a computer model that shows that when a few organic molecules have developed some catalytic skills and reach the necessary level of diversity , then they spontaneously form an `` autocatalytic set '' ( a life form ) . His theory is based on the general complexity theory , which states that when a system reaches some critical level of complexity , it will naturally produce a degree of complex order ( 4 ) . '' http : //www.lifesci.utexas.edu/cours ... 2/JENNIFER.html A. G. Cairns-Smith 's Callisto Theory : That life began from a type of living-clay Richard Dawkins says of this `` Cairns-Smith believes that the original life on this planet was based on self-replicating inorganic crystals such as silicates . If this is true , organic replicators , and eventually DNA , must later have taken over or usurped the role . '' http : //originoflife.net/cairns_smith/ `` Other Theories In spite of the intense level of work on the RNA world in the last decade , there is no true consensus theory for precellular life . There are many theories . Here are some of the others ? A few scientists still say that DNA could succeed in starting life on its way ( 11 ) . But even the shortest DNA strand needs proteins to help it replicate . This is the chicken-and-egg problem . There is a `` proteins first '' school . For example , Manfred Eigen of Germany 's Max Planck Institute says , `` There is no doubt that proteins , which are more easily formed , were first on the scene '' ( 11.5 ) . Of course , these first proteins must be much shorter than any used in life today , because of the sheer unlikelihood of forming useful long ones out of a soup of amino acids . Physicist Freeman Dyson proposes to solve the chicken-and-egg problem with a double origin , one for metabolism ( proteins ) and one for replication ( strands of nucleotides ) ( 12 ) . In Seven Clues to the Origin of Life ( 13 ) , A. G. Cairns-Smith says that clay crystals could have served as the scaffolding upon which the first short DNA or RNA genome was constructed . A new elaboration of this idea prompted one writer to wonder , `` Primordial soup or crêpes ? '' ( 14 ) . Even more recently , another tangent on this path leads to zeolite ( 14.5 ) . Biologists Harold J. Morowitz ( 15 ) , David Deamer ( 16 ) , and others ( 17 ) , advocate a theory that could be paraphrased as `` containers first . '' Jeffrey L. Bada of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography holds the minority view that the early Earth was frozen and believes precellular life started in `` cold soup '' under the ice ( 18 , 19 ) . Chemists Claudia Huber and Günter Wächtershäuser say the soup where life originated was actually quite hot , probably , near undersea volcanic vents , where iron and nickel sulfides might catalyze some of the necessary reactions ( 19.5-19.7 ) . Cornell Astronomer Thomas Gold wonders if life might have originated in a hot environment even deeper , in Earth 's crust ( 19.8 ) . Stuart Kauffman of the Santa Fe Institute , says , `` ... whenever a collection of molecules contains enough different kinds of molecules , a metabolism will crystallize from the broth '' ( 20 ) . Another idea is the `` PNA world . '' Because starting the RNA world is so difficult , there probably needs to be a pre-RNA world . PNA , or peptide nucleic acid , might have some of the properties necessary to constitute that world ( 21 ) . This would be pre-precellular life .

I can well believe that pandion can not answer this question ; no one can accurately answer it . We know that baldness , as a genetic condition , is polygenetic ( ie it 's controlled by multiple genes ) and autosomal ( the genes [ or at least the bulk of them ] do not reside on the X or Y chromosomes ) . Despite being autosomal , people appear statistically slightly more likely to exhibit balness if the trait comes from their mother 's side of the family . Even if we knew precisely which genes were involved and which of those genes your kids had , we still can not tell you the likihood of your children being bald . The chances of the gene combination being expressed in the correct way to cause baldness are dependent on age , hormone levels , stress and probably a variety of other environmental conditions .

That question is ignorant . Why would any evolutionary biologist make such a stupid claim ? Do you actually think that by implying that such stupidity is a claim of evolutionary biology you are somehow showing that it is wrong ? You do n't seem to be able to actually offer any facts that refute evolutionary theory so I guess it is necessary to resort to nonsense in hopes that the stupid will believe you .
Just to provide some evidence of how incredibly shallow your liberal justifications and imaginings are , here 's some light reading for you simone . It 's from something called a book . CHAPTER 9 HEALTH MORE SPECIFICALLY , MENTAL HEALTH In discussing abortion , and abortion for the mothers health , it is absolutely crucial to know what `` health '' means , legally and in practice , regarding abortion . `` Health '' was defined in detail by the U.S. Supreme Court . The Court said that abortion could be performed : `` . . . in the light of all factors  physical , emotion-al , psychological , familial , and the womans age  relevant to the well being of the patient . All these factors may relate to health . '' Roe vs. Wade , January 22 , 1973 And in its companion decision , `` Maternity or additional offspring may force upon the woman a distressful life and future . Psychological harm may be imminent . Mental and physical health may be taxed by childcare . There is also the distress for all concerned associated with the unwanted child , and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable , psychologically or otherwise , to care for it . '' Doe vs. Bolton , January 22 , 1973 44 In a concurring opinion , Justice Douglas further elaborated what `` health '' meant when , in law , it related to abortion . He detailed if she had to : `` endure the discomforts of pregnancy ; to incur the pain , higher mortality rate , and aftereffects of childbirth ; to abandon educational plans ; to sustain loss of income ; to forego the satisfactions of careers ; to tax further mental and physical health in providing childcare , and in some cases , to bear the lifelong stigma of unwed motherhood . '' Roe vs. Wade , January 22 , 1973 This definition of `` health '' has been adopted internationally . As a result , in any nation , if abortion is al-lowed for the womans `` health , '' that country permits abortion on demand unless other aspects of its laws add restrictions . The World Health Organization of the United Nations defined it as including social , emotional and economic well being of the woman as defined by the woman herself . Lets narrow it down to mental health , in the psychological sense , and askare there mental health reasons for abortion ? No ! The woman with mental health problems is far more likely to experience post-abortion emotional and psychological problems than a more stable woman . Four classic references here are these : `` Women with a history of psychiatric disturbance were three times as likely to have some psychiatric disturbance '' after an abortion as others who had no such history . '' E. Greenglass , `` Abortion & amp ; Psychiatric Disturbance , '' Canadian Psych . Assn . Jour. , vol . 21 , no . 7 , Nov. 1976 , pp . 453-459 Dr. Charles Ford and his associates at UCLA reported the same finding . `` The more serious the psychiatric diagnosis , the less beneficial was the abortion . '' C. Ford et al. , `` Abortion , Is It a Therapeutic Procedure in Psychiatry ? '' JAMA , vol . 218 , no . 8 , Nov. 22 , 1971 , pp . 1173-1178 `` The more severely ill the psychiatric patient , the worse is her post-abortion psychiatric state . '' E. Sandberg , `` Psychology of Abortion '' In Comprehensive Handbook of Psychiatry , 3rd ed . Kaplan & amp ; Friedman Publishers , 1980 All of these support the original official statement of the World Health Organization in 1970 : `` Serious mental disorders arise more often in women with previous mental problems . Thus , the very women for whom legal abortion is considered justified on psychiatric grounds are the ones who have the highest risk of post-abortion psychiatric disorders . '' Then `` mental illness '' as a reason for abortion is just an excuse ? Precisely . What about psychological problems after abortion ? When your authors wrote Handbook on Abortion in 1971 , there were a few murmurings about post-abortion problems , but little was known . We then saw the negatives as mostly physical . When we wrote Abortion : Questions & amp ; Answers in 1985 , physical damage , while still a major problem , was given less emphasis , and negative psychological aftermath was being seriously investigated . With the publication of this book , far more is known about what is now called Post Abortion Syndrome which clearly is a post traumatic stress syndrome . A Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome ? Yes . This type of problem was first seen in large numbers in Vietnam veterans , but did not manifest it-self until a decade after they returned . The same ten-year delay has been evident with abortion . T. Keane , Vietnam Vets Trauma disorder level at 15 % , Am . Med . News , L. Abraham , Dec. 2 , 1988 , p. 2 What is Post Abortion Syndrome ( PAS ) ? Many women are very ambivalent about getting aborted but do go ahead . Those around her told her ( and she told herself ) that it wouldnt bother her . When symptoms occur , she tells herself it cant be the abortion causing them , and then into play come her two major psychological defense mechanisms : Repression and Denial . For some this works successfully . For others it shades off to manageable distress , to severe and life-changing upset and even to suicide . There is a delay ? Yes ! Her initial response in most cases is a feeling of relief . Then , with repression and denial , she avoids the problem , usually for years 5 years is common , 10 or 20 not unusual . But then , for some , the negative feelings bubble up and break through . Often the precipitating event is : she has a baby , or a close friend or relative has a baby that she has close contact with . She finds out she is sterile , or other life-changing events . What are the symptoms of PAS ? Guilt is ever present in many guises , along with regret , remorse , shame , lowered self-esteem , insomnia , dreams and nightmares , flash backs , anniversary reactions . There often is hostility , and even hatred , toward men . This can include her husband , and she may be-come sexually dysfunctional . Crying , despair and depression are usual , even at times with suicide attempts . Recourse to alcohol or drugs to mask the pain is frequent , sometimes leading to sexual promiscuity . There is also a numbing and coldness in place of more normal warmth and maternal tenderness . Is this due to religious guilt feelings ? Perhaps in some it is a factor , but most women re-ported on in the early studies were unchurched at the time . Perhaps they had seen pictures of fetuses ? Again , not most . Most did not know `` it '' was a `` baby '' when they aborted . But Ive heard that the American Psychological Association says that PAS doesnt exist . This group has been strongly pro-abortion , and this definitely colors its thinking . But during the past decade or more , there have been dozens of national conferences on PAS . There are many professional articles and about 15 books adding more and more authentication to its existence and knowledge about it . Further , every one of the almost 4,000 pro-life pregnancy help centers in the U.S. now has found that an increasing percentage of their time is now devoted to treating PAS women . But so many studies deny PAS . True , and most are invalid for two reasons : ( 1 ) Timing : Most studies have investigated feelings for only a few weeks or months post abortion when she is still feeling relief that her problem is gone . Since the delay before PAS symptoms intrude is often 5 years or more , these studies are invalid . ( 2 ) Superficiality : Her repression and denial push this deep into her subconsciousness . If the survey is done by questionnaire or single interview , she routinely denies problems . These studies are invalid . Only by lengthy psychological testing and counseling can she often admit to some symptoms , much less tie them to the abortion she so desperately wants to forget . You mean most studies miss PAS ? But most polls show few emotional problems  only a sense of relief ! Yes , but `` What women really feel at the deepest level about abortion is very different from what they say in reply to questionnaires . '' A Canadian study polled a group of women who had previously completed a questionnaire in which they denied having problems from an abortion . One half of this group was randomly chosen for in-depth psychotherapy . '' What emerged from psychotherapy was in sharp contrast [ to the questionnaires ] , even when the woman had rationally considered abortion to be inevitable , the only course of action . '' It was demonstrated that the conscious , rationalized decision for an abortion can co-exist with profound rejection of it at the deepest level . Despite surface appearances , abortion leaves behind deeper feelings `` invariably of intense pain , involving bereavement and a sense of identification with the foetus . '' I. Kent et al. , `` Emotional Sequelae of Elective Abortion , '' British College of Med . Jour. , vol . 20 , no . 4 , April 1978 I. Kent , `` Abortion Has Profound Impact , '' Family Practice News , June 1980 , p. 80 Are there valid studies ? Yes , and two meta-analyses : James Rogers , who carefully examined over 400 published studies , pointed to the almost universal use of `` poor methodology and research design '' and `` grossly substandard power characteristics . '' He concluded that `` the question of psychological sequelae of abortion is not closed . '' J. Rogers et al. , `` Validity of Existing Controlled Studies Examining the Psychological Sequelae of Abortion , '' Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith , vol . 39 , no . 1 , Mar . 1987 , pp . 20-29 49 Another concurred that existing research is methodologically flawed and that women who abort show more negative outcomes than those who deliver their babies . E. Posavac et al. , `` Some Problems . . . Psychological Effects of Abortion , '' Psychology & amp ; Health , 5 , 13-23 How about specific studies ? An excellent study thoroughly explaining and documenting PAS by the team that named this entity is : A. Speckhard & amp ; V. Rue , Post . Ab .

Does it ever lead to suicide ? Suicide is rare among pregnant women , but much more common after induced abortion . It is never re-ported under maternal mortality from abortion , of course , even though it is causative . `` The suicide rate after an abortion was three times the general suicide rate and six times that associated with birth ... . the rate for women following a live birth was 5.9 per 100,000 ; following miscarriage 18.1 ; following abortion 34.7 . '' They note that women frequently get short term `` post-natal blues after having a baby , but that this rarely translates into suicide , and that the initial stress of having a child is transitional , the over-all effect having a positive effect on womens health . '' M. Gissler , Abortion/Suicide Link , Br . Med . J. , Dec. 6 , 1996 Then it is rare among pregnant women ? In Abortion : Questions & amp ; Answers your authors de-tail 5 studies clearly showing this . One comment may suffice : `` The fetus in utero must be a protective mechanism . Perhaps women are reluctant to take another life with them when they do this . '' How about after abortion ? In the above book your authors also give the findings of Suiciders Anonymous , and that : suicide post-abortion is several times more common than post-delivery . British Medical Jour. , 1996 What of Psychosis afterwards ? This has not changed since Dr. M. Sims original paper . He stated that , compared to post-delivery disturbances , post-abortion psychoses are much more serious , last longer , and are more likely to recur . They are more often the `` hard '' cases . M. Sim , `` Abortion and the Psychiatrist , '' British Med . Jour. , vol . 2 , 1963 , pp . 145-148 How about an example from a non-Christian culture ? In Japan , where abortion has been legal and accepted for over four decades , a common custom is to conduct Mizuyo Kuyo services in honor of the god Jizo . This god has been made the patron saint of infants who died of starvation , abortion , or infanticide . Small baby statues , in his honor , are bought and dressed . Then , in a Buddhist Temple , rites of sorrow and reconciliation are carried out . Does abortion have any negative effects on her other children ? In some cases a definite `` Survivor Syndrome '' has been demonstrated . Children usually know that mother is pregnant . They also know when she `` gets unpregnant . '' This may cause Survivors Syndrome , similar to that of Jews who survived the holocaust . It is an irrational but real guilt at `` why was I saved and why were they killed . '' Dr. Ney has written about this . Dr. Edward Sheridan of Georgetown University has observed also a fear and mistrust of the mother . Originally , a small child , sensing a siblings arrival , doesnt welcome it . `` When the baby suddenly disappears , the frightened child may get a warped sense of his own power to will people away. Or , if he knows that his mother was an active agent in doing away with the sibling , he begins to fear her . '' A simple explanation of this was published in : L. Bond , `` The Surviving Sibling , '' Natl RTL News , Sept. 25 , 1986 . It is also closely associated with child abuse : Dr. Phillip Ney , Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Christ Church , New Zealand , and of later at the University of Calgary , Canada , while still at the University of British Columbia , published a widely read study of this . His analysis clearly pointed to the fact that abortion ( and its acceptance of the violence of killing the unborn ) lowered a parents psychic resistance to violence and abuse of the born . P. Ney , `` Relationship Between Abortion & amp ; Child Abuse , '' Canada Jour . Psychiatry , vol . 24 , 1979 , pp . 610-620 Is there treatment for PAS ? Yes , but it is not easy . We first must note that only a few doctors are sensitized to the necessary dynamics of treatment . Specifically , most psychiatrists and psychologists arent much help , nor are psychotropic drugs . This requires a gradual healing process , and during it she must have ongoing close emotional support from one or several people who do not have to be trained professionals . As of the late 1990s , the place to start is your pro-life pregnancy help center . They can either work with her themselves and/or will know who can . Basically , there are five steps to the healing process : ( 1 ) Counter the denial . Bring this back into her consciousness and admit she was a party to killing her own baby . She must grieve over her lost child  tears , mourning as for another loved one . ( 3 ) Seek Divine forgiveness . This was not expected but seems essential for almost every woman . ( 4 ) Forgive others . Difficult , again , but some of this is needed to complete the healing and get rid of her long repressed anger . ( 5 ) Forgive herself . Not many get this far , but those who do have real inner peace . What is absolutely crucial at every step in the above is compassionate empathy , support and understanding from one or more persons around her . J. Willke , P.A.S .

How is it a sin to exercise your constitutional rights ? Why should the law-abiding have to pay such a tax ? Why not let the criminals pay the tax since they 're the ones who break the law ?
Oh , i thought `` bullet '' was some sort of slang term . Never mind .
Again ? ? ? ? Gun control laws by design are meant to kept inner city citizens ( i.e . black ) from owning guns ... Liberal terms such as `` saturday night special '' all have racist undertones . Also since the majority of gun violence in the US is minority on minority ... Who are these laws meant to target ?

You are the only one defending them now ... the funny part it , planned parenthood had the stats as reasons why abortion should be legal ( or is legal ) . But wait ! As we established the number of people that died from abortions went down to under a thousand so this reason is still not accurate and is still misleading . Anymore ideas ?
And that 's the rub : it never has ( apart from when it has of course , with the various versions that exist ) . You choose to put faith in the writings of a primitive bronze age society . I prefer to trust a textbook that is regularly updated to reflect our latest findings ; our most up to date and accurate knowledge of the world .
Since sugar ( in this analogy ) represents opposite-sex marriage ( which IS marriage , IMO ) , everyone can use it . You just do n't want to . So instead of being willing to use a different sweetner , you DO want to change the composition of sugar .
Those books were written by people in BC times . People didnt understand the things we do now , so they tried to find another explanation for these events . Furthermore , i think the bible is a book of fables and fiction , i dont think it was intended to be a book taken literally .

Why do you apply the term evolution to these ? Do you , deep-down , believe that these have resulted from evolution too ? You are not alone in making evolution an absolute all-encompassing world-view ... Oddly enough Close_slave_can denies that anyone does this . `` Evolution is not alone in its naturalism . All science , all engineering , all manufacturing , and most other human endeavours are equally naturalistic . If we must discard evolution because of this philosophy , then we must also discard navigation , meteorology , farming , architecture , printing , law , and virtually all other subjects for the same reason . '' http : //www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA601.html However , the influence is not all one-way.. `` We live under capitalism , so we have capitalist science . We want to bring a different set of values into being , to bring about a new set of ruling ideas & # 8212 ; ideas of a society without rulers , a part of a different ideology or world-view . We want to bring about a socialist society . It will , if we are vigilant , have a socialist science . I can imagine it , or some of it . '' SCIENCE IS SOCIAL RELATIONS at http : //www.human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/sisr1.html `` The major political task is seen as showing the reality of capitalist domination in the apparently neutral science '' http : //www.human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/pap100h.html In capitalist societies , the influence of money-ideology helps shape evolution in a dialectic relationship . `` In short , the triumph of Darwinism implied the death of God and set the stage for replacing Biblical religion with a new faith based on evolutionary naturalism . That new faith would become the basis not just of science but also of government , law and morality . It would be the established religious philosophy of modernity . '' ( Fr . Seraphim Rose , & # 8220 ; Genesis , Creation and Early Man & # 8221 ; , p17 )
But it is o.k . for them to repeatedly break the law like yourself speeding again and again , as long as they sign the ticket . What hogwash .
I have no problem with hunting weapons . And speaking of working on debate skills , maybe you could refrain from opening lines like the one you used here . No one 's screaming anything . You simply want to introduce emotion where none is required . If any side routinely loses its cool , its yours .
But how would abortion laws ( at least the ones I would like , and most of pro-lifers ) cause this ?
What 's been observed besides an insect ? How do they know for sure there were n't different species of horses .
While your previous problem fell because it dealt with the future , this one falls because it deals with the past . I am interested in the NOW - the moment when the determination is being made . That PREVIOUS organisms needed to reproduce in order for things to end up where we are today does not tell us that it is REQUIREMENT for something existing NOW ( at the time the determination is being made ) to reproduce in order to be considered living .
Please cite the source . Other wise it ; s unfounded .
The truth is an end in itself .
I 've seen that argued throughout these posts , but I do n't think I 've seen the argument from start to finish . As such , I have not been absolutely convinced of this . Do you mind helping me out a little by drawing this argument out in a little more detail ?
A model of a live fish and fossils of a fish are going to be significantly different under any circumstances . There was a gap in the fossil record , scientists looked it at it , and using the theory of evolution mindset , automatically assumed that it went extinct millions and millions of years ago . But of course , it was absolutely wrong . A prediction was made based on the theory of evolution and it was absolutely wrong . Simple .
Asexual reproduction . Thank you and goodnight .
So , because she 's bigger , she can kill the fetus off ? That is generally the idea the school yard bully has .
That 's the standard dance . Victor Stenger did n't say it that way . On the back of his book , one review puts it this way ;
I think you got it backwards Kelvin . You 're the one that said you would n't let your children play with toy guns because you 're afraid that your children would n't be able to tell the difference between a real gun and a toy gun . Blindone never advocated toy gun-control . On the contrary , Blindone was pointing out that toy guns do n't harm children . And if your children ca n't tell the difference between fantasy and reality how do you expect them to handle a gun responsibly ? They might try to shoot the boogey man or their own shadow .
The fact is that much of what this author states to be is absolutely false and perfectly represents the distortions of the liberal left . And that is precisely why its type of rationalization never entered the thinking of the voters who voted against gay marriage in California .
How , exactly , can natural selection `` select '' for a characteristic that is n't present ? Are you implying that it is possible that certain characteristics arise , de novo , because of the environment ?
This has everything to do with guns , how are these people suppose to protect themselves ? Since the police have been told to just let them go , crime will run rampant , it will become THE place to go if you feel like duing a little robbery a little burglary , gosh wonder if they got ta let rapo 's and killers runaway to . Only 2000 ? I lived in George Wa . and the population was less than 2000 , it was also just off I-90 and we had plenty of crime from people passing through not necessarily from people who lived there .
So if you 're really interested in enforcing gun laws , do n't support the NRA .
Actually , it is quite correct . You misunderstand . The text book was trying to make it simple so that you would understand . The text book was n't simple enough . The first record of carbonaria was in 1848 . The discussion you quote was trying to explain quite simply , so that you might understand why the change took place . There is no record of anyone ever seeing a carbonaria before 1848 . It is probably a safe assumption that an occasional mutation caused some to be born from time to time , but they were not able to reproduce to the extent that they were ever noted before 1848 .
we do ... ... most fossils found are surface finds -- which means anything found on the ground probably contradicts uniformitarian principles because every fossil found laying on the ground probably -- according to ToE -- did not die at the same time . For example , many mammal bones are found on the surface -- yet so are dinosaur and other `` ancient '' bones from animals that supposedly lived millions of years beforehand . Of course evolutionists will come back and claim `` erosion '' with no evidence of such , not to mention how rock can be removed from bone after millions of years of being cemented to it . I 've got a 900-page book called `` Hidden Archeology '' ( Cremo ) that dives into hundreds of fossils and artifacts that are in the `` wrong '' strata . Your assertion is blatantly false .
I believe you mean pro-choice , do n't you . A pro-life mod might agree with you .
And that part of the decision ( not allowing for the woman 's health to be taken into account ) is why I do not agree with nor do applaud this decision ( in fact I am rather disgusted with it ) . If you 'd like to see a more concise view from me , you can see the thread that Another_opinion started here : The Mother 's Health exception - where do we draw the line ?
oh sure there is . you would just have a lot of angry off people though .
And if you do n't think it was justified ? It 's a public alley , she can walk down it whenever she wants without justifying herself to anyone .
This is why religion may not survive the future . People like Arch are setting it as opposed to science and in that position it will be doomed to fail . The only hope is if the nuts stop making it in to an adversarial situation . Arch is doing nothing but distorting the very thing he holds so dear , but that is already clear to anyone who knows his work here .

Your answers are ridiculous , ChuzLife , just like all the others . I never mentioned a child trap . You are all liars trying to distort My posts , and hide from the realities of abortion . I said a womb-trapped child . Thats 100 % descriptive . Its a child , in the womb , who is not able to leave . I never said that they are trapped by the vagina . I never suggested that pre-birth children float around and are somehow `` caught '' in a trap . None of your can face up to the Forbidden Truth on abortion .
Certainly he did . I have known many scientists ( mostly biologists ) who had a similar attitude . The problem is that you have it upside down . The study of glorious , naturalistic science informs us of God 's creation . You are trying to impose your childish version of your god on the universe .
The George Bush visual , the reference to heaven/monkeys was apparently used to emotionally cover the inadequacy of the fossils in the ground , and mutations of drug resisting bacteria as complete explanations .
Actually , had hemp and marijuana been legal and cultivated widely in this country since 1937 , it would have tanked along with the rest of our economy . Right now as an outside industry looking in , it has the potential to generate billions of dollars in California alone . The taxes generated alone from the sale of marijuana could be massive . The Obama administration has made clear that it is no longer going to support the practice of raiding so called cannabis clubs in California , where `` medical '' marijuana is dispensed . Many in California want to take it a step beyond , and move towards decriminalization and regulation of cannabis in the same way we regulate alcohol . Will the federal government step in and stop this , or are they going to actually do the constitutional thing and support state 's rights to make and enforce their own laws ? Will the federal government consider amendment of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 ?
See ?
You know , you and Saddam may have more in common than you might have thought . But really , I think they may be on to something with Sharia Law . If you steal , they cut off your hand . Pretty good deterent . If you do drugs they execute you . If you commit adultery they stone you to death . But Saddam thought that Sharia law was too harsh to be used in general practice .
I agree it 's a threat to us but the point is whether it 's really caused by increaing amount of carbon dioxide and how big the threat is . Maybe global warming is just a part of process of global climate change which occured several times long time ago , ie , ice age things like that . As far as I know , global warming is one of the catastrophe which leads to extinction of human beings . However , there might be another problems which are also big threat to us and all creatures on the earth . Anyway , I 'm not an expert of environment , so I might be wrong but at least I can say it seems there are some bad effetcts of global warming such as rising sea level , abnormal climate pattern , things like that . We should do something , which might not be appropriate way to solve the problem but it 's surely the beginning .
because that 's the subject of this thread : what designing a solution to a problem actually entails .
No , actually , we do n't . I suppose it 's pointless to ask someone who would speak for God to not tell me what I know .
And do you include me in that analysis ? Perhaps you could link me to these threads so that we can see exactly how they 'open ' I 'm not saying I have n't seen put-downs of religion on this forum , but in my experience there 's either personal history between the posters ( the response is effectively continuing an on-going spat that transcends the thread ) , or the OP itself was laden with flame-bait .
I bet you can not show one piece of objective evidence for any supreme being what so ever without resorting to lies , distoritions or plain ignorance . Also , many of those scientists doing the work you are ignoring are probably not atheists at all . You seem to be assuming that . Since you are making the claim these scientists are 'atheists ' , I want you to demonstrate that they are .
Well said . Most Americans favor more gun control , but unfortunately this majority of Americans tends not to vote based on the issue of gun control while a very vocal minority composed of gun activists definitely does vote based on the issue . This is something politicians have realized since 1994 so they have been more hesitant to support gun control . There probably will be more gun control supporters in office in the coming years but I 'm not sure how much this will change things .
You are not only rude but incorrect in calling sinjin an XXXXX . His opinion is just as valid as yours . He is quite far from idiocy . I percieve his point to be that you do not have a right to endanger the lives of others by engaging in a firefight with some perps who may not have fired if you had n't shown up playing Sheriff . While we have not yet perfected a method of reliably predicting exactly what some perp will do if left in control with a gun in his hand in a crowded mall , we can assume that more harm will come if he is not taken down and disarmed . The fact that a citizen may legally have a gun in his pocket capable of knocking down a large animal rather than a pea-shooter that will only make it mad is comforting to me . I like big guns , too . I can agree somewhat with the idea of hesitating to interfere when an altercation seems imminent , but I can not agree that armed citizens should never `` endanger the lives of others '' by pulling his piece and firing at the perp . By the way , when you quote someone you should use their exact words , not your version of what they said ... and you should apologize to sinjin for calling him an XXXXX .
Really ? Do all your views depend on somebody else changing them for you ?
I understand your points ... all I am saying is that these are issues that come up.. not saying that these are the ONLY issues ... I 'm not judging that the rapist in the example was n't craving affection or anything like that ... I 'm not judging anyone on that one ... my point was that if a woman is raped and becomes pregnant , she has become pregnant through no choice of her own . But I am not about to take the side of a rapist ... I do n't care how abused they were . When I said that the woman would be reliving the rape , I did n't mean that they would n't otherwise ... but think if you were a woman and were raped , and became pregnant by someone you did n't know or know anything about ... As for the murder part of it , what is it called when anti-abortionists picket outside clinics and shoot and kill the abortion doctors ? Is that not murder ? Does n't that make them hypocrites ?
I know these statements are a bit hostile , but arrogant ignorance just ticks me off . What makes you think you have the knowledge to post on a thread like this if you did n't know that the Buddha never even claimed to be God ?
My god , you 're almost as bad as EZ .
Well , ok . I can see your point as well . However , I 'm looking at the reality of the religious right and their influence . What is achieveable in the short term and long term ? I think people need to be educated . Equal IS equal . You are absolutely right . And eventually , I pray there IS equality for gays . But given the current trend in the US , I doubt very much that it is going to happen . The Religious hate groups are well organized and well funded against us . We have to be smart and make a plan to get to the equal status we are entitled to . New Jersey is just another step towards that equality we want . But it 's going to take more states ... . one at a time . But IF gays can achieve more and more equal rights along the way , then great . I believe eventually gay marriage will happen in the US , but it 's not going to be very soon ... . maybe not in my lifetime . It will happen though .
exactly .
So , you 're basically saying that Biden was lying through his teeth when he said he does n't support gay marriage ? It was all just a lie to keep from losing votes ? Interesting .
Pregnancy is ALWAYS physically harmful . You try carrying a load of extra weight about and see what that does to your heart . It is also always life threatening - women still die from it and you never know how childbirth is going to go . These are the normal , frequent or expectable temporary side effects of pregnancy : -- exhaustion ( weariness common from first weeks ) -- altered appetite and senses of taste and smell -- nausea and vomiting ( 50 % of women , first trimester ) -- heartburn and indigestion -- constipation -- weight gain -- dizziness and light-headedness -- bloating , swelling , fluid retention -- hemmorhoids -- abdominal cramps -- yeast infections -- congested , bloody nose -- acne and mild skin disorders -- skin discoloration ( chloasma , face and abdomen ) -- mild to severe backache and strain -- increased headaches -- difficulty sleeping , and discomfort while sleeping -- increased urination and incontinence -- bleeding gums -- pica -- breast pain and discharge -- swelling of joints , leg cramps , joint pain -- difficulty sitting , standing in later pregnancy -- inability to take regular medications -- shortness of breath -- higher blood pressure -- hair loss -- tendency to anemia -- curtailment of ability to participate in some sports and activities -- infection including from serious and potentially fatal disease ( pregnant women are immune suppressed compared with non-pregnant women , and are more susceptible to fungal and certain other diseases ) -- extreme pain on delivery -- hormonal mood changes , including normal post-partum depression -- continued post-partum exhaustion and recovery period ( exacerbated if a c-section -- major surgery -- is required , sometimes taking up to a full year to fully recover ) These are the normal , expectable , or frequent PERMANENT side effects of pregnancy : -- stretch marks ( worse in younger women ) -- loose skin -- permanent weight gain or redistribution -- abdominal and vaginal muscle weakness -- pelvic floor disorder ( occurring in as many as 35 % of middle-aged former child-bearers and 50 % of elderly former child-bearers , associated with urinary and rectal incontinence , discomfort and reduced quality of life ) -- changes to breasts -- varicose veins -- scarring from episiotomy or c-section -- other permanent aesthetic changes to the body ( all of these are downplayed by women , because the culture values youth and beauty ) -- increased proclivity for hemmorhoids -- loss of dental and bone calcium ( cavities and osteoporosis ) These are the occasional complications and side effects : -- hyperemesis gravidarum -- temporary and permanent injury to back -- severe scarring requiring later surgery ( especially after additional pregnancies ) -- dropped ( prolapsed ) uterus ( especially after additional pregnancies , and other pelvic floor weaknesses -- 11 % of women , including cystocele , rectocele , and enterocele ) -- pre-eclampsia ( edema and hypertension , the most common complication of pregnancy , associated with eclampsia , and affecting 7 - 10 % of pregnancies ) -- eclampsia ( convulsions , coma during pregnancy or labor , high risk of death ) -- gestational diabetes -- placenta previa -- anemia ( which can be life-threatening ) -- thrombocytopenic purpura -- severe cramping -- embolism ( blood clots ) -- medical disability requiring full bed rest ( frequently ordered during part of many pregnancies varying from days to months for health of either mother or baby ) -- diastasis recti , also torn abdominal muscles -- mitral valve stenosis ( most common cardiac complication ) -- serious infection and disease ( e.g . increased risk of tuberculosis ) -- hormonal imbalance -- ectopic pregnancy ( risk of death ) -- broken bones ( ribcage , `` tail bone '' ) -- hemorrhage and -- numerous other complications of delivery -- refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease -- aggravation of pre-pregnancy diseases and conditions ( e.g . epilepsy is present in .5 % of pregnant women , and the pregnancy alters drug metabolism and treatment prospects all the while it increases the number and frequency of seizures ) -- severe post-partum depression and psychosis -- research now indicates a possible link between ovarian cancer and female fertility treatments , including `` egg harvesting '' from infertile women and donors -- research also now indicates correlations between lower breast cancer survival rates and proximity in time to onset of cancer of last pregnancy -- research also indicates a correlation between having six or more pregnancies and a risk of coronary and cardiovascular disease These are some less common ( but serious ) complications : -- peripartum cardiomyopathy -- cardiopulmonary arrest -- magnesium toxicity -- severe hypoxemia/acidosis -- massive embolism -- increased intracranial pressure , brainstem infarction -- molar pregnancy , gestational trophoblastic disease ( like a pregnancy-induced cancer ) -- malignant arrhythmia -- circulatory collapse -- placental abruption -- obstetric fistula And a few more permanent side effects : -- future infertility -- permanent disability -- death . And I 'm sure I 've missed some .
Argument from ignorance . Nevermind that marc9000 is largely ignorant of chemistry , too .

I argue against them with regards to whatever argument they muster . Do we have any of those on this message board ? Because from what I can see , it 's primarily the `` religious '' argument counter ...
So , you accept Geology , and in turn accept the fact that the earth is around 4.56 billion years old ( and not the literalist age given by fundies who worship the bible ) . And yet you reject all of the discoveries of geology ( the fossil record , etc . ) that evolution explains perfectly . And , as Pandion said before , it stands alone and shows the fact that life has existed in other forms billions of years ago , and humans only appeared recently . BTW , the `` fools '' that are denying the validity of Geology as a legitimate science are your fellow creationists . As to the bible answering `` how did we get here '' , it is as good and trustworthy at that as any other mythology of any other civilization . The bible is mostly a collection of myths , folklore , fairy-tales , and politically influenced propoganda .
Wilkinson is as full of **** as you are . When we brought the Heller case before the Supreme Court , we wanted them to determine whether or not DC 's handgun laws , which were n't voted on but rather just passed without debate , were constitutional or not . That 's the job of the Supreme Court , to determine if a law is unconstitutional or if it may be allowed to remain as law . Your standard of pressing legislators to pass one law to repeal another is just plain stupid . The only ones who we could ask to do such are the DC people who threw their full support behind the DC gun ban , proclaiming that it was both constitutional and reasonable , and should be allowed to remain . There was absolutely no way of using the ballot to get anything done . And another thing . There 's absolutely no political agenda here , whatsoever . All we want is for one part of the Bill of Rights to be treated with the same equality and respect as all the other parts .
Yes , do a quick search on `` self organizing systems ' to find out why .
I think a better question is what preserved their life for so long ? It is the mercy of God that upholds and preserves people in this life . It is the sin of human beings that is responsible for death .
What people say does not matter . There is simply no legitimate rational basis for this assertion .
Well , when we talk about rights as allowable behaviour , then yes we do have this right . And it does n't end when it affects someone else . GALTON :
God has historically been thought to have been physically working behind the scenes to keep the physical world and universe operating . If a lightning bolt struck the earth , for instance , it required God to physically sling it . Rigorous scientific study has reduced him to much smaller daily operational labors , IMO . Who and where are these rigorous creationist organizations ?
~The Assemblies of God believes strongly that God has declared great displeasure and opposition toward homosexual conduct , '' according to a church position statement on the topic.~ That 's her church , and obviously the reason she 's attempting to fold religion into government . Is that the same god who whispers in Bush 's ear ?
And you fail to answer the question .
** The war against war metaphorsThe age-old practice may harm both science and scientists [ Published 16th February 2007 03:05 PM GMT ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Last month , when the University of Nottingham in the UK opened its new Centre for Healthcare Associated Infections , a facility dedicated to studying and controlling `` superbugs , '' The Guardian newspaper interviewed its director , Richard James , about why such a research center was necessary . He said : `` This is a sophisticated army with astonishing weapons . And each time we develop something new , [ bacteria ] develop a defense for it . '' The use of such war metaphors in science and medicine is not new . As early as 1934 , the British Medical Journal wrote about the `` War Against Cancer , '' a phrase we still often hear . But today , militaristic language pops up in almost every scientific domain : conservation biology ( `` invasive species , '' `` biosecurity '' ) ; global warming ( `` global war on global warming '' ) ; and biomedicine ( `` killer cells , '' `` hitting multiple targets '' ) . The attraction to such language is understandable , as it draws attention , and perhaps even funding ( who can forget US President Richard Nixon 's declaration to `` conquer '' cancer in his 1971 state of the union address , since which hundreds of billions of dollars have poured into cancer research ? ) . Still , some scientists worry that the use of war metaphors has negative effects on both science and the scientists who adopt the language . For instance , scientists who use military terms may risk losing credibility , warned Erik von Elm , an epidemiologist at the University of Berne in Switzerland and co-author of a recent Lancet correspondence on military metaphors . `` One of the features of science should be to be objective , '' but war metaphors are precisely the opposite , he noted . `` These terms have an intention , they are sort of modern propaganda . '' Indeed , when Nottingham 's James referred publicly to the coming `` post-antibiotic apocalypse , '' the UK 's Chief Nursing Officer accused him of sensationalism and scaremongering . Scientists who frame problems in a militaristic manner also likely have a drastically limited perception of the problem and how to tackle it , noted Berkeley cognitive linguist George Lakoff . `` This is not language , this is the way people think . '' In microbiology , for instance , scientists often frame viruses and bacteria as the enemy , and may focus on destroying them and be blind to alternatives , said Brigitte Nerlich , professor of science , language and society at the University of Nottingham . With bacteria like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) , however , `` You have to look at multiple factors , and not just in terms of attack and defend , '' she said . Indeed , some argue that our militaristic use of antimicrobial agents has , by introducing new selection pressures , only made pathogens stronger , while a consideration of other factors -- like host behavior and the social and physical environment -- could offer better solutions . Brendon Larson , assistant professor of environment and resources studies at the University of Waterloo in Canada , argued the same of `` invasion biology , '' where scientists may automatically assume an invading species must be removed . But in some cases , a sustainable relationship makes more sense -- for example , removal of the `` invading '' Himalayan blackberry from parts of California hurt the native tricolored blackbird , which used the plants as nesting habitats . `` We 're entrenched in a particular way of seeing this situation , that [ invasive species are ] enemies , they 're bad and we have to get rid of them , '' Larson told The Scientist . Indeed , according to Larson , the modern use of military terminology may have contributed to US President George W. Bush 's decision to merge part of the government agency responsible for invasive species into the Department of Homeland Security . Still , scientists are not likely to move beyond the adversarial metaphor anytime soon , said Columbia University 's Barron Lerner , author of The Breast Cancer Wars : Hope , Fear and the Pursuit of a Cure in Twentieth-Century America . `` They 're here to stay , '' Lerner said , admitting that when he was writing about the prevalence of such metaphors , he unknowingly began using them himself . Remembering , as writer Susan Sontag advised , that war metaphors in medicine can be misleading , and remaining aware of metaphors ' effect on science , is the best scientists can do , Lerner noted .

I think it is very difficult , if not impossible to prove a negative .
Do you want to explain what you think the problem is ? You 're going to see a much larger change if you start fiddling with the controls than if you were replacing bases within the protein coding sequence - a lot of those would n't change anything in the protein , and a lot of the changes to the protein would n't have a significant effect either .
really ? So no murder law ? No theft law ?
You were passing it off as scientific . -I do n't know anything about the evolution of heart chambers . -We see the same mutation happen all the time . Not all people with Down 's Syndrome have parents with Down 's Syndrome genes .
Yes they are . Original source documents are much better for debating the bill then secondary sources , but it requires more effort and alot more energy . Personally , I have n't a clue as to what the bill is , but the more original documents the better .
Oh , is THAT where you are getting your information ? The Biotic Message ? I read the book tens years ago and eventually sold it because it was n't worth keeping . You do know that it is a book on biology written not by a biologist , but by an engineer . Right ? Walter Jame ReMine is a mere engineer of some sort , and has no degree in biology . And biologists strongly argue against his claims . PS : I even had a few exchanges with ReMine when I was posting at ARN . I argued against him , even though I was an IDist at the time , because he was not being truthful .
See the refutations of Augustines various proofs for the details . Its not actually very interesting since its so elementary . There are many disproofs on the net in addition . One novel one which seems rather neat is this one .
Fair enough ; I was just simplifying and using 'pro-life ' as a dichotomy with 'pro-choice ' . Clearly , it 's not that simple . With regards to religion in the debate - that 's fine by me for this thread* .
Exactly , which brings us back to square 1 . Creationism is based on religion , and Evolution is based on the Scientific method , but is not proven . Creationism isnt even near being proven . So , why would you try to impose your religious beliefs on public school children ?
Since we see birds today with feathers on them , I do n't see how you can claim that feathers are a impediment to a species survival and would devolve .
And I guess it does n't have anything to do with brain size either .
murder would violate the common law . People should be free to do as they please , but an employer should also be free to employ who they see fit . we are not talking about legalized beatings . And are you ... now saying being gay is a belief system ? or are they born that way ? which is it ? personally , i would never agree to discriminate against people for being gay.. however ... if they are flaboyantly gay ... then i do favor discrimination . there is no need to flaunt it.. as it disturbs people . but if they act normal.. speak normal.. and seem normal , then there would be no justification for firing them in my book . -Mosheh Thezion
Men should n't be deciding because they ca n't get pregnant after being raped . When was the last time a man 's life was ever at risk because his wife was pregnant ?
And so am I ... Dear rapture -- With all due respect , I would encourage you to formulate a clear thought and communicate it in a way that an average joe like me will be able to understand . As your two posts are written , I have no clue what you are attempting to communicate . I do have some interest in the topic of viability though , so if you could perhaps explain what you are saying , I would be interested in discussing the topic with you . Thanks ! The Bootfitter
Sounds like lots of arbitrary statements . Your assuming things to be true , and attacking the person not the argument .
Premise 1 : God lives in another universe ( Heaven ) and therefore can not be detected in this universe . ( Definition of God ) Premise 2 : If something exists , then it can be detected/sensed . ( Definition of Existence ) Contrapositive of Premise 2 : If something can not be detected/sensed , then it does not exist . Conclusion : God does not exist . The reason that this doens't prove Atheism is that it can not disprove the existence of , say , the Hindu gods , which are defined as beings in this world that can be seen . It just disproves theism .
So what ?
So you would like pre-teens to have open access to buy , carry and use firearms ? The prudence is because them exercising their 'rights ' can lead to someone else being deprived of all of theirs .

Wrong . It is a precision machine designed to kill effectively . It can be operated by other than human means .
The flying spaghetti monster is similar to the term `` flat earthers '' - ridicule without substance . It 's much more recent however . It was concocted in June of 2005 by one Bobby Henderson , a young college graduate with a degree in physics . He wrote it as a joke , as a response when the Kansas board of education took up the question of the teaching of ID in schools . That web page is a long one , with all the little pictures & amp ; everything . It probably started more simply than that , and grew after it became the cult hit that it did . It got attention on many other websites , and in the press as well . The Washington Post reprinted it word for word , and a New York Times headline read `` But is there intelligent spaghetti out there ? '' With that kind of publicity for a view that desperately gropes for talking points , it 's not surprising that it comes up in many debates here . We should be able to get far beyond it in this debate - are you prepared ? Both terms , `` flat earthers '' and `` spaghetti monster '' seem to come up much more often than `` happenstance origins '' , or even `` Darwinism '' , a 150 year old concept that 's troubled by several recent discoveries . Happenstance origins is a serious term - I used it in my opening affirmative argument , and you have n't touched it . Can you ?
So you were unable to see evidence of erosion in the pictures that I showed you ? By the way , the fossils are not bone - they are rock . They are a different kind of rock that the sedimentary rock in which they are found . Perhaps if you actually educated yourself you would know that the fossils are usually much harder than the surounding sediment . Of course , anyone who made an effort to learn before speaking would know that .
Actually there is , RU-486 ( AKA Mifepristone ) , which aborts upt to two months into the pregnancy . But again , this poster sems to be talking about Plan B , which is NOT an abortion pill , and was what was allowed in the military .
I watched the program and managed to keep the television switched on despite the distractions from irrelevant images , loud hymn singing , and the editing of Dawkins ' contribution - which made him look like a 'mad scientist ' . The claim that Intelligent Design is a novel idea sprung full-armed from the heads of American religious enthusiasts is wrong . What is now loosely called the 'design argument ' has been known to philosophers for at least two centuries as an a posteriori argument ( literally , 'from backwards ' ) . It is examined at length and dismissed by Hume in his 'Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion ' published in 1779 .
Actually , if you read the friggin article ( *GASP* HERESY ! ! ! ) , you 'd see that this guy was attacked while WALKING FROM THE STORE . If you ca n't see the difference between his mental existence ( quite enough to allow him to move about and do relatively ordinary chores like going to the store ) , and a foetus that does not have mental existence , there is no hope for you .
Really ? So suppose that you have two models for the way the solar system works . You measure where the planets are today in the night sky , and you use both models to predict where the planets will be ten years from now . In ten years you make actual measurements . The predictions of the first model for Mars are off by , say , a tenth of a minute of arc . The second model is off by a hundredth of a minute of arc . ( For comparison , the full moon in the sky has a width of about 30 minutes -- I may be wrong about this ) . So , are you saying the first model is wrong ? The error seems to be pretty tiny ( by most standards ) . What about the second ?
I think this is why people like Paul Helmke think that Supreme Court rulings on the constitutionality of gun control laws are win/win situations for his side . He realizes that an individual rights interpretation or a ruling that the states are bound by the Second Amendment could still leave the door open for plenty of gun control .
And what dictates the cells activities ?

Oh yes , just look at all the evidence present in this post . Yeesh . BTW , if ID has nothing to do with religion , why , when asked a question about ID did you immediately bring up the Noachian flood ? EDIT You apparently posted while I was writing my reply . Just so you know Sparky , saying `` Nuh-uh ! Did too ! '' is not `` offering evidence to support your positions '' FFS ...
I suspect that you are thinking of birds . But early birds had fingered claws on those wings . It is generally true that no organ ever springs into existance completely developed where nothing existed before . The wings of bats , birds , and pterodactyls are merely the modified fore-limb of a tetrapod . There is evidence that insect wings may have arisen from some sort of thermal panel . And of course , size has considerable relevance to flight . Wingless spiders fly by spinning a loop of silk that is carried by the moving air . Very small insects require almost no wings to fly . What they do is more similar to a whale in water than a bird in air . If by chance , a small animal is upsized because of a competetive advantage , and the wings are too , then it becomes a larger flying animal .
Good is a subjective term .
Mr. Brown was able to attend ball games . Not exactly held captive was he ?
Yes , I know it 's a killing ... I never said that it was n't , I only said that LEGALLY it is not considered to be a crime ( at this point ) .
Plenty of instances of killings at courthouses to prove you wrong . And let 's not forget the biggest case of murder of innocent unarmed people in a gun-free zone . That 's right , September 11th . Everybody but the terrorists were unarmed , everybody died . Ca n't get any worse than that .
So God deceived us by creating a system that today works as we know it in a way that refutes Literal Creationism and has absolutely no evidence of being different at any time in the past but secretly made the named light sources abide to his secondary set of physical laws which he then removed from creation without a trace . Got it : God 's a Liar , a deceiver and a cheater Not the first time you argued that .
besides pain , there is a plethora of experiences that take place in a person 's mind that can not be yet detected by science . imagination , taste , dreams , art appreciation , etc . even though these things are real , they can not be quantitatively described in physical terms , so they can not be treated by science

More evidence of your selfish motives , which is not necessarily a bad thing , but it sort of disqualifies you from being objective and reasonable about the abortion issue . Its obvious if you were in the fetus ' position , you 'd be against abortion . I seem to detect a lot of abiguity and contraction on where you stand on this
Right now , I might consider it , as I am now a few weeks away from my graduation . Back then , I would not , as I had just begun college ( I was in my sophomore year for my BS - now I 'm about to get my MS ) . However , there is also that other major part of my decision - I never had the intention to become pregnant , and we even took steps to make sure I would n't . That also is a major factor in any of my decisions on it . Another decision that involves my work is that from about my fifth month on ( acording to the doctors I spoke with ) - I would be unable to work - that 's four months , and while right now I am in good standing with my company and they might even allow me to do that , back then I was just starting out , and would be unable to do so . So , I 'd say that at the moment if that were to happen , and that I was paid a stipend ( I know of no place near me that does so ) and then gave the baby up for adoption , my fiance and I would seriously consider the prospect . I know that in the future - in five years or so - we expect to be able to have paid off all our loans , and we will then consider actually having a baby . So in summary - now I would consider it , but back when I had the actual abortion ( 6 years ago or so ) I would not consider it .
The correct answer to this question is no . They also have yet to take up electrolyte 's challenge to explain the human plantaris muscle or , for that matter , most any vestigial structure . Actually , WW probably would n't have too much trouble with them- he appears to support common descent . SS and AA , on the other hand , ca n't do much about it .
Yep . Darwin 's discovery was that natural selection was the reason that evolution was n't random .

well , based on this argument , why shouldnt we kill mute , paralysed , vegetable , comatose , and very very drunk people , since they all cant think , or if they can they cant communicate that they are thinking . How about new-born babies that dont know anything ? how about retarded children ? you are fooling yourself if you think that women undergo abortions because they dont like that particular `` part of their body '' . women undergo abortions because they dont want to raise the child when its born . until you face that truth , you 'll be arguing under a dellusion
See above , again
Well , I would call it a formalized set of rules and procedures for evaluating the validity of propositions . How does that relate to a dogma with a higher refresh rate ? ? ? ? ?
By that logic being black or of some other minority , is a disorder . That 's not correct . AA is suppose to be a leg up for the so-called less fortunate .
Wrong again . A nervous system is required in order to feel pain . Many species of living-flesh animals have no nervous system and can not feel pain of any description ... crickets included . I do not know at what point the nervous system in a fetus is developed enough to transmit pain signals .
And what type of objectivist views do you have toward gay issues if I may ask ? I 'm assuming gay issues may seem irrelevant since they probably do n't pertain to you well , cause your not gay ... .
To step in for Duck , Why would he follow a 74 year old with parkinson 's if he were n't the pope ? We would n't . The whole point is that he is the pope . We look to the pope to be the messenger of Christ and thus an authority on faith and morals . ( By the way he 's 84 years old and I think he gives a powerful message about the value of life and purpose in the elderly . ) So we do n't just follow any 74 year old with parkinson 's . We follow the one who is the 264th successor of Peter who was appointed by Christ to lead his Church . But to address your assertion on the bible and abortion : Nowhere in the Bible is abortion specifically prohibited but the foundation of Christian argument from a biblical perspective is the fact that the unborn being is established as a person from the moment of creation . The unborn being is considered a child . Thus the commandment , `` Thou shalt not kill '' applies . Check out some of these verses as a start : Exodus 21:22-25 , Psalm 139:13-16 , Psalm 71:6 , Deutoronomy 30:19 , Luke 1:15 and 1:41 , Isaiah 49:1 , Jeremiah1:5 , 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 It is also of note that it was , in a sense , a curse to be barren in the Jewish/Christian community . Children were thought of as a blessing from God Psalm 127:3-5 , Matthew 18:10 ( there are many other indications of this as well ) . An attempt at abortion would go against the prevailing culture and mindset . The early Church also spoke out against abortion . Look at this link to see excerpts of the Church Fathers on the subject : http : //www.catholic.com/library/Abortion.asp Keep in mind that not all Christian practices and beliefs are explicity spelled out in scripture . In discussing abortion in the light of Christianity ( including scripture ) , there are some essentials that must be noticed . The Bible unequivocally `` tells '' us that abortion is wrong and in stark contrast to the Christian message . It does that in the nativity of the Gospel of Luke and it does that in the Passion narratives of the four Gospels . The Christian story is about birth , creation , joy , and perseverance . It is also about sacrifice for others and giving life . Father Frank Pavone illustrates this by describing a remarkable contrast in thought on abortion between abortion supporters and Christ . Abortion supporters say , `` This is my body , I can do with it what I want . I can destroy others to preserve my life . I can destroy others so that I may live as I want . Do not interfere with me . '' Whereas , Christ says , `` This is my body , which is given up for you . '' `` This is my body '' -- same words but much different in intent , in action , in charity , in love , in faith , in hope ... Jesus gives his body away so that others live . Abortion proponents cling to their own bodies so that others die .
Tell me , how does a link to a religious nut who thinks the New Testament was first written in Aremic , despite tons of evidence to the contrary , have anything to do with refuting the scientific theory of evolution ?
Well not to the pro-life league . Remember the Unborn Victims of Violence Act passed by the senate after laci peterson ? or as they call it , conners law ? The UVVA creates a federal law making it a crime to cause harm to a `` child in utero , '' recognizing everything from a zygote to a fetus as an independent `` victim , '' with legal rights distinct from the woman who has been attacked . `` More than 30 states already have similar laws on the books . In practice , these laws treat the pregnant woman as little more than collateral damage in an attack portrayed to the public as one directed against the fetus . '' See , this law has nothing to do with prosecuting criminals who attack pregnant woman , it is about turning pregnant women into criminals . Why do i say that ? Lynn M. Paltrow , executive director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women sums it up quite well : *In 1984 , South Carolina 's Supreme Court created a state feticide law in a case where a man viciously stabbed his pregnant girlfriend , causing her , among other things , to lose her pregnancy . In 1997 , South Carolina used this law against a pregnant woman , Cornelia Whitner , who was charged with failing `` to provide proper medical care for her unborn child . '' Whitner had given birth to a healthy baby who tested positive for an illegal drug . Based on extrapolation of the state feticide law , Ms. Whitner was convicted of criminal child abuse . At sentencing Ms. Whitner begged for drug treatment . The judge responded , `` I think I 'll just let her go to jail . '' *Regina McKnight was an indigent 22-year-old woman with a drug problem . She became pregnant and despite her problems had every hope of carrying her pregnancy to term , but the pregnancy ended in stillbirth . The hospital reacted not by offering her counseling or drug treatment , but rather by helping build a criminal case against her . Eventually she was convicted of murder . The South Carolina Medical Association and other leading health groups concluded that there was no evidence that McKnight 's drug use caused the stillbirth . Moreover , no one in this case , not even the prosecution , believed that McKnight had any intention of harming the fetus or losing the pregnancy . Had McKnight intentionally sought to end her pregnancy by having an illegal third trimester abortion , her sentence would have been two years in jail -- but because of a law similar to the bill President Bush just signed , she is today serving a 12-year sentence . read more here another good article on the matter : Do pregnant woman have rights ? *In 1984 , for example , a Nigerian woman pregnant and hospitalized in Chicago was forced to have a C-section . She refused the surgery because she planned to return to Nigeria where she would be unable to access C-sections for future births . The hospital obtained a court order and forced her to undergo the procedure . Hospital staff tied her down with leather wrist and ankle cuffs while she screamed for help . *Another hospital obtained a court order to force a pregnant woman to undergo a blood transfusion . Doctors `` yelled at and forcibly restrained , overpowered and sedated '' the woman in order to carry out the order . *In Washington , DC , doctors sought a court order to force Ayesha Madyun to have a C-section . The doctors asserted that the fetus faced a 50-75 percent chance of infection if not delivered surgically . The court , apparently viewing the pregnant woman as having no more rights than a slab of meat , said , `` [ a ] ll that stood between the Madyun fetus and its independent existence , separate from its mother , was put simply , a doctor 's scalpel . '' With that , the court granted the order and the scalpel sliced through Ms. Madyun 's flesh , the muscles of her abdominal wall , and her uterus . When the procedure was done , there was no evidence of infection . *Angela Carder at 27 years old and 25 weeks pregnant became critically ill. She , her family and her attending physicians all agreed on treatment designed to keep her alive for as long as possible . The hospital however called an emergency hearing to determine the rights of the fetus . Despite testimony that a Cesarean section could kill Ms. Carder , the court ordered the surgery because the fetus had independent legal rights . As a result , Ms. Carder not only lost her right to informed consent and bodily integrity ; she lost her life . The surgery resulted in the death of both Angela and her fetus . `` All of these women were denied the right to bodily integrity and physical liberty and their fetuses were granted more rights than any legal person under law . '' That line just about sums it up . These laws are n't about saving the unborn , and neither is the pro-life movement . It is about controlling and punishing pregnant woman . It is about taking rights away from the woman the moment of conception..as if she no longer exists . These people would not think twice about prosecuting a pregnant woman whos pregnancy results in misscarriage ... intentional , accidental , whatever .
Actually both are relative in every situation . Especially `` The Truth '' as espoused by religious fundamentalists such as yourself , as there are as many different versions of the truth as there religious fundamentalists .
Well , you did n't have my experiences , now did you ? Each woman who has an abortion coul have innumerous circumstances and experiences .
Thats true . However , do we not have a state of reasonable compromise at the moment ?
Can you imagine two snipers , a mile apart taking shots at each other with these babies ?
So let me make sure I have it right , in order to be a family-man/Catholic , I must be anti-abortion and against the rights of homosexuals . Is this what makes a good family-man/Catholic ; denying the rights of those who are different from what is considered by some to be `` normal '' , and telling others what to do with their body ?
On the flip side , you should never let anyone force you into carrying out a pregnancy you do not want . as for planned parenthood vs doctors , planned parenthood counselors are required to give you unbiased information and referrals , as far as i know , a doctor is not required to do either . Just because you do not like the work that planned parenthood does , it gives you no right to malign them or their employees . You have never proved that these people are anything but compassionate and qualified care givers and medical professionals .
How do you explain the change of appearance of the animals over time , as recorded by fossils ?

Am I to believe that you are a soldier there now ? Your rage towards me in your post only shows just how easily upset you are . I posted exactly what I meant to and you went off on a tangent . I asked you for proof and all you can do is a schoolyard tactic if `` show me yours before I show mine ? '' Pitiful .

Thanks . Well I 'm a resident of California currently but my partner has orders to Virginia . If they allow outside residents to apply for a license we 'll do it Considering DC is only a four hour drive or so .
True .
Which still proves nothing in regards to climate change or global warming Why do people seem to think that for global warming to be a fact that it would have to stop snowing ?
As was pointed out in some of your own quotations , survival is not an 'end ' of natural selection . Natural selection is the differential reproductive success of organisms with more favorable suites of characteristics . It is a statistical tendency . Individual organisms may work to survive , but they also work to reproduce . That 's as close as it gets to `` purpose . '' And as you know , Darwin 's favored term was natural selection . He never used the phrase `` survival of the fittest '' without also making a reference to natural selection . The opposite is not the case . Since Darwin 's time `` survival of the fittest '' has been rejected by evolutionary biologists because it is such a poor representation of the extent of the theory .
I 'll respond when I can figure out what you 're trying to say .
I agree that all other reasonably safe options ( such as caesarian delivery , in womb operations , etc . ) should be looked into before resorting to abortion in that third trimester . As with the example of the friend of jitobear , sometimes there is just not a reasonably safe option for a particular woman since her conditions might not allow those alternate procedures . As for the question of limits on the health exception , yes , the exceptions that are clearer to me are the ones that could ultimately lead to the mother 's death or complete debilitation . However , there is also a gray region that I am undecided on . For example : - What if the pregnancy would lead to less critical loss - such as the loss of use of her legs or arms ? What about one limb - such as the use of one arm ? - What if the pregnancy would give a medium chance of loss - such as a 20 % chance of paralysis ? The gray region is harder to quantify and the moral balance gets trickier . Perhaps that is why this issue has n't really been addressed specifically in law . Where decisions in morally gray regions are concerned , it is too easy to criticize them and politically unwise to venture into that territory .
Ok , I will.Let 's go back to what you posted :
Pathetic , why would you let anyone besides yourself determine who you call family ? Nobody is forcing their religion on you . Nobody is even saying who you can or ca n't get married to . What is being said is that you , or anyone else , does n't have the `` right '' to have that marriage recognized by gov't . Universal recognition by gov't does n't even happen in hetro marriages . Nowhere in the founding documents of this nation does it say `` All gov't entities shall recognize all people 's marriages '' . Since we have `` a government for the people by the people '' , the duties of government not spelled out in the founding documents are determined by the people . You have the freedom to vote your beliefs and so does everybody else .
That 's great , ... hopefully you will re-post some of them here and we can debate/ discuss them .
point me toward the right way then ? if creationists are wrong then why is evolution right ? this is a biased answer based on your beliefs . please tell us how creationists were wrong . i would gladly like to see you try !
But if the state refuses to recognise their right to commit to each other in a legal union , then they are being denied at least one right which is available to everyone else . This can also affect legal entitlements . Leo
Well I do n't . I hardly follow gun issues because well their old news in my opinion . It 's the same old tired bickering of one side screaming rights and the other side screaming restriction and meh just a bunch of ticked off angry people .
How does this have anything to do with marriage ? Reproduction occurs outside of marriage and has done so long before man became civilized . Permitting only gay marriages wo n't decrease numbers . Increased family planning and birth control will .
actually , human skin is sensitive to light , not to mention nearly all plants are sensitive to light . light sensitive cells are abundant even where there are no eyes . just a tiny bit of reading and youll realise that they didnt `` magically '' appear .
Are you incapable of reading , as well as being mind-numbingly assinine ? The thread is about creationism , not evolution . Attacking evolution does not defend the lies of creationists . Your failure to defend biblical creation shows that you can not support your own position and instead have to resort to petty nit-picking of your opponent 's position . This is both stupid and intellectually dishonest .
Yes , it seems you never learn , so I have no hope of educating you , and absolutely no intention .
Uhm , where does this say that the earth rotates ? Nowhere . Simply speaking of morning or dawn does not show knowledge of earth 's rotation . In today 's world it does , but not back then . In fact , the verse our Creationist conveniently left out says the the Earth has edges ... this is probably more flat earth mentality , like the four-cornered earth mentioned elsewhere in the Bible . PS : And while we 're at it , let 's not forget about the things that Bible gets completely wrong , like bats being birds ( Leviticus 11:13-18 ) .
Look again . This time , try and put yourself into the time the Bible was written . Try to see things as they did . Then ask yourself how those scriptures fit into that time period . It 's not hard . But you may need to take a few classes on how to analyze historical documents and Hermeneutics before you get it .
Depending on perspective , everything or nothing . Many on the liberal front often tell us that the police are there for the purpose of protecting us , that they 'll keep us safe , that we do n't need a gun if we just call 911 and let the police handle it , etc . Well a lot of good that advice is gon na do these South Carolina people , now that the police have been ordered not to pursue criminals who run from the scene of a crime . If they start hopping fences then the police ca n't pursue in their squad cars , and they ca n't get out to chase after them either . So ... even before , the courts have stated explicitly that the job of the police is not to protect anyone , and now we have mayors ordering the police to not apprehend fleeing criminals . This means that those townspeople are gon na need to rely on themselves . And if the gun control laws are liberal and excessively strict , they 're SOL . Innocent people are gon na get getting killed because of this new policy .
Your logic is that if no one was there to witness it , it therefore did not happen . Under that logic , creation did not happen because no one was there to witness it , God does not count because we ca n't even prove it exists , much less hold it accountable for being there to witness it . The entire argument based around the witness via your argument is worthless .
So , it 's a proven fact that children denied the act of abortion suffer negative effects ? Hmmmmmm
The 10 commandments are a real time story , told and recorded by the person with whom it happened to ... Moses . Genesis , is a history lesson , told by a man who had no understanding of modern science , or the language to describe it in that fashion ... Moses . If God chose to reveal to you in some special way , the origins of the universe , for you to write down for generations to come.. you would write a different story than Moses . Just as one person views art differently from another person . I see no duplicity between the two .
Actually JP so far 5 states have passed gay marriage so no not every time it is put to a vote do we lose . And how am I forcing anyone to accept gay marriage ? Am I forcing these voters to attend my wedding or dare I say be in a marriage themselves ? And I can not agree with you more about changing the image of the gay community as a whole.. We are not all a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people running around ... What I find funny is once strait people find out how boring we really are , and how we pay taxes just like every other joe schmo they 'll think nothing more of special rights lol ... But actually like I stated earlier in another thread if those unions constituted the same legal rights as married couples I would be content .
False . Random mutation and natural selection have been observed in the lab using bacteria ; in some cases the researchers even determined exactly which mutations in the genomes produced the advantageous changes .
what is your basis ? what do you mean by `` evil '' ?
Oh come on , only now you 're going to be picky about that ? I could have sworn we all agreed to use that term insted of using some of the other more radical monachers . So now you want to change the rules because some wild hair got stuck crossways ? Typical .
Funny how you have n't had a literature or history class recently . Would you like me to contact the several history and literature/English teachers in my school and ask them if they credit Homer as the actual author of those epics ?
Just out of interest , which particular aspect of `` truth '' are you getting at here ?
And what , exactly is `` it '' that `` Darwinists '' got wrong ?
You might want to consider talking to the children of gay people about their parents . You could start with mine . When he hears arguments like yours - his response `` shame on them . '' He 's 11 , but he gets it , and finds your point of view as repulsive as racism . `` You do n't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows . '' ~ Bob Dylan
The problem is that she would have had to display reckless disregard for the situation , such as drinking heavily . I think that many consistent pro-lifers would be happy to have her charged with manslaughter .
Of course they have been . They are following the Bible which says homosexuality is a sin .
And you are so uneducated that you do n't even know that the woman 's egg sends out a 'signal ' which tells the sperm exactly where it is so that the pregnancy can begin . The newest forms of birth control are now working on ways to block that chemical 'signal ' - but I guess you could n't have learned that reading your funny papers
Actually , scientists do n't speak out enough about idiocy and ignorance .
Well , I am a philosophical naturalist and materialist . I do n't believe the notion of free will . I think it 's all a matter of physics and chemistry . Be that as it may , whether I am right or wrong about the notion of free will , the consequences of evolution go beyond free will . They go well beyond what humans call good and evil , however we define those . How about disease , predation , parasitism ? Are they the product of an omnibenevolent god ? That thought gave Darwin pause . Pain and suffering through natural causes yet through no fault of one 's own ? How is that a product of a just god ? There are aspects to real life -- some call them the problem of evil -- that are hard for Christians to explain , so many try to explain them away by creating the notion of `` the Fall '' . Everything was perfect before `` the Fall '' , and terrible afterwards . But that was n't the way it was . The lion was never an herbivore . The lamb was never fearless of lions . Pain , suffering and death have always been an integral part of life , and they always will be.Such benevolence . Such justice ! And so potent is this toxic religious belief we feel we have to blame outselves for our trials ! Or at least , religious believers feel they have to blame themselves . As an atheist , I see the contradiction between reality and Christian faith . That is why I stopped being a Christian . My learning of evolution and these biological facts of life was a major ingredient in that . I accept that there are Christians who also accept evolution as an historical fact . I question whether they have thought either their faith or their science through .
Really ? Can you cite those sources ? I am sure that you will be citing the literature rather than creationist web sites .
`` [ On ancient Athens ] : In the end , more than freedom , they wanted security . They wanted a comfortable life , and they lost it all & # 8211 ; security , comfort , and freedom . When the Athenians finally wanted not to give to society but for society to give to them , when the freedom they wished for most was freedom from responsibility , then Athens ceased to be free and was never free again . '' & # 8211 ; Edward Gibbon History repeats itself when forgotten .
That 's only true because of the bonehead in the whitehouse . Once bush leaves you will see a lot of great things becoming reality through embryonic stem cell research
I 'm calling you out . Exactly what is the street price for an AK-47 in Miami ? Obviously you have the answer to this question , along with evidence that your answer is correct and factual , or you 're just trolling and trying to derail a serious discussion , proving that you have nothing to contribute .
The books of the NT ( GOSPELS ) were agreed on due to their content being inspired by God . Anything `` rejected '' did not contain that inspiration .
And I challange you to find just one instance where he 's ever claimed that ALL fossils have ALWAYS been found at precisely the right depth . And then link to it , of course . It will be amusing to see how you misinterpreted whatever was actually said .
It appears that peddler is finally open to learning new things ! ( Unless , of course , peddler is simply being facetious ... which is not obvious from the immediate context . )
Can you be a bit more specific ?
He made a post suggesting you were a troll , it has been removed it seems . Anyway , glad to help .
Well they are of people and if logic is followed , contradiction does not occur .
So what are the Native Americans ( the actual residents ) - chopped liver ? If anything it should be their creation stories of the Sioux , etc . that should be taught over that of Christians ( the invaders and slaughterers of the indigineous people ) .
They affect you too . I must quote again ... `` The current controversy is largely a reflection of different scientific philosophies , linked to ideas about race through their treatment of variation . But there is more to it . Even if they have no conscious social agenda , scientists are bound by the same preconceptions as everyone else - their social , religious , and educational backgrounds influence their choices of theories and , perhaps more important , their philosophies of science . Karl Popper noted more than once that it does n't matter where hypotheses come from , only whether they explain the evidence they are based on , wether they are subject to disproof , and whether they can hold up to enthusiastic attempts to disprove them . This philosophy forms the basis of deductive science . But hypothesis do come from somewhere , often the underlying assumptions of society . Moreover , not only the differences in sources of ideas , but also different premises scientists have held about evolution , human nature , God , and how science should be done , have always underscored the controversies about human evolution . '' Wolpoff , M & amp ; Caspari , R , ( 1997 ) `` Race and Human Evolution : A Fatal Attraction '' , p12 . I have been at pains to quote this , not because their work is in the field of epistemology ( for when I post evidence , from epistemological sources , I get the reaction I just got from you ; 'too much information'/'irrelevant to scientists ! ' These evolutionists recognise the variety of influences , not all affecting us all on a conscious level . You simply ignore this evidence and present a statement that you do n't believe it . Further I find it odd people should demand that I cease quoting from outside sources to back up my statements .
Private property rights are the most fundamental of all rights and the basis for any government at all . When a society ignores those basic rights it ceases to be civilized and diminishes to tyranny , anarchy and crime . Previous societies have always used criminals to encroach on property rights and deprive the people of fundamental rights of any kind . When people cease to have dominion and exercise rights to protect that property by any means possible there is tyranny . There is no rule of law in the UK any more . BRITAIN is there ! Proud to have broken those ties back in 1776
No it is n't .
lol . One can not prove anything to someone who wishes to remain willfully ignorant . Besides , you have n't addressed the content of that post you quoted . You will NEVER , EVER , EVER submit your beliefs to those in the practicing fields . A forum of practicing PHDs in Chemistry , Biology and Geology is something you are very , very , very afraid of .
This is a free market of ideas . The good ones survive . The bad one die like dinosaurs .
Gun registration part of the plan all along
Hillarious . I remember seeing that a while back . That 's liberals for you , the laws they propose are for the 'peasants ' , not for them to obey . They , afterall , are better suited for making decisions like these than you . You need them to think for you.. to care for you.. cradle to grave . You may also recall that famed anti-gunner Rosie O'Donnell has armed bodyguards but says you should n't have guns yourself . You can not be trusted , afterall . And who was that writer who shot the kid in the hand that was swimming in his pool late one night ? Carl something . Another anti-gunner who preaches 'do as I say , not as I do ' . Liberals.. LOL !
Just because we do not know the laws of logic does not mean they do not exist . I could debate someone and violate the laws of logic and claim I dont have any knowledge of them and therefore they dont exist for me . Attacking the person again , not the argument , I guess atheists can make logical fallacies because its a concept that they can choose to not exist like the concept of hofflenosh
And how many guns found at crime scenes have been linked back to their original owners ?
As a Christian comfortable with their faith and reality .
Evolve is used for a lack of a better word . Change could be used but that is more of a short term process . Evolve indicates a measured change over a long period of time . It even works in suggesting one idea and split off into many versions of the same idea . So I would agree that for lack of a better word , the church is evolving . What would you say ?
I 'll bet that I have read more by creationists and about creationists than you have . I 've certainly read more creationist writing than you have science . I know what creationists believe . Some believe that God created by using the big bang and evolution . Some prefer to claim that the mythology of nomadic , bronze age herdsmen is scientifically accurate . I have taken the time and invested the effort to learn about creationism . Too bad you have failed to do the same with science .
Well , PR on both sides will probably be gearing up on this , so which ever side does have the correct legal interpretation will probably be broadcasting it pretty soon now . It 'll just be a matter of seperating the real answers from the bogus ones . Given how politcal the issue is I 'm not going to accept any claims for correctness that do n't cite actual specific law . As opposed , for example , to Romney simply saying `` the constitution says they got ta '' .
He did and I did n't . Kind of prefer to fight my own battles .
I already did explain the obnoxious childs dishonesty accipiter . You really need to read the posts before embarrassing yourself asking ridiculous questions . The ignorance that child contributes here is enough for any 5 forums , much less this ONE . You notice that this liar never actually supported his claim that I ever ARGUED THAT GOD IS AN EPIC LIAR ! ! ! But that never stopped him from making the dishonest claim , did it ? So my question for you is this ; why would you even rely on such a liar to make any type of valid point at all when he is n't even connected to reality which he proves in every single post in which he corrupts and perverts what another member says by completely misinterpreting what he says ?
hey D , i am not going to get attitude w/ you.. i do n't see a piont in getting mad at you
I know . And if only those darn blacks had done the same thing with miscegenation and segregation laws , this world would have been a better place . Who do they think they are trying to solve unconstitutional legislation and governmental practices in a court of law ! The totalitarian of it all ! Do n't they know that rights are something that should be left up to the whim of the masses , to allotted to minorities when the majority pleases ? < end sarcasm >
And the good news is that this good trend has continued . According to the latest FBI UCR . Crime in the United States -- by Volume and Rate per 100,000 Inhabitants , 1989 & # 8211 ; 2008
Just to quote your last post , `` Religion influences all laws . Without that influence , there would be no laws . '' You said point blank that without religion there would be no laws . Now your spinning and changing your view to `` The basis of modern law is from religious law '' . I do n't mean to be picky , but trying to spin facts like this does n't sit well with me . Especially since your first claim was pretty outrageous . Laws will exist whether religion does or not . Religion is similar to a book of laws although that does n't mean that it existed before the laws did . Trying to even say humans would n't exist without God should n't even be brought up . The Christian God that is described in the Bible might not even exist . The Bible is flawed at the very least meaning doubt has to be placed in anything written in it that is n't provable .
Well maybe on the 4473 they could put a little box to check if you are a straw purchaser , maybe a psychic in the back room or ask them politely if they are straw purchasers .
At what cost ? How many civil rights are you willing to give up in the name of a few less murders each year ? Are you perfectly willing to be stopped by the police on a block-by-block basis and forced to show identification and traveling papers , all the while the officers on location are pointing their guns right at your head , ready to blow you away at the first sign of a twitch or if you display even a hint of hesitation to comply ? How desperately do you crave a police state ? How much do you favor a nationwide curfew where violators can be arrested by the police and held without legal counsel for an indefinite period of time ? Do you favor the use of physical and mental torture to force convictions even from the innocent ?
And if you rewind a little over 40 years , the exact same thing could be said about interracial marriage . Archie 's reply is a non-argument , and false at that . Multiple other groups state discrimination in marriage , but there are LEGITIMATE STATE INTERESTS prohibiting their marriage . Little things like child rape , lack of consent , and other issues .
You mean before abortion was ever dealt with as a moral issue , so there were no laws against it at all ? But just for the heck of it , would you mind humoring me with any evidence that this paragraph is true at all ? I 'm referring to the stated mindset of the day , the social attitude you outline of the time , and of course the bolded section .
`` Iraq , one of the most heavily armed countries in the world , is believed to harbor enough guns to arm every one of its 24 million citizens . Iraqi civilians also have access to other light weapons , such as rocket- propelled grenades , mortars , and bombs - making their arsenals potentially more deadly . `` In the absence of a governing force in Iraq , some Iraqis are looking to increase their personal weapons caches in order to protect themselves from looters and roving armed gangs ; others want small arms to conduct illegal activities and gain political power . Reports have surfaced that gun merchants have set up shop on the streets of Baghdad , selling AK-47s for as little as $ 10 . '' War ends , but Iraq battle over small arms just begins | csmonitor.com In this thread I was told that handguns were useful in combating tyranny- Is The Second Amendment No Longer Relevant ? So I 'm supposed to believe that handguns are useful in battling tyranny but not having numerous amounts of the above weapons ? Shows how inconsistent people can be when it serves their agenda .
Even with the Supreme Court ruling , Sinjin and Chet have said otherwise ... on the day this was posted !
Actually , no , my understanding is that in most states the law does n't require this at all . Many doctors take what is known as the Hipocratic oath , but it 's not a legally binding oath . Doctors may be subject to personal lawsuits , but that 's not the same thing . Also , the fact the church you mentioned owns a `` beachside pavillion '' has nothing to do with much of anything . If the church truly owns it , they can refuse any ceremony they want . That it has been `` open to all for years '' carries no weight whatsoever . It is church property -- which is essentially the same as a church saying it does n't want gay ceremonies in its sanctuary which churches are free to refuse . Maybe churches are imposed upon in such ways in Canada , but not in the US . Given these matters , I 'm not sure the HRC is being any more honest than the video they are responding to .
And no country in the developed world has such a system . Take your strawman elsewhere . In any case , if such decisions are made I 'd rather have them made by democratically accountable government than private corporations . I live in a country with a very good , though not perfect , public healthcare system , and the system proposed in the US is not government run , by any stretch of the imagination . The government will not own the hospitals , employ the medical staff , pay for most of the medicine , that will all be done by private insurers and private hospitals still . My maybe vote therefore means I think the US system needs to be nationalised , it 's much more efficient to do that .
Did I say that ? No . I blame a society of judgemental , unintelligent people . Nothing to do with how you view abortion or reproductive rights .
I believe God is separate fom time and space , also . I did n't say that he could n't have created it in any more or less than 6 days . I simply said that it could not have taken him millions and billions and trillions of years .
Nah I 'm not debating this . I 'm trying to show that this debate does n't really prove anything . But I 'm sure you can get the names of those who are willing to debate this and look them up in the future if you ever want an easy debate victory
Thank you for basically admitting that Pandion 's argument is correct . We did not evolve from apes . Apes did n't even exist . We evolved from primitive primates , along with apes , chimps , orugantans , etc . How would they evolve into a new species of human ? That would require them to be on a very similar evolutionary path as us , and obviously , they are not . Just like a shark can not evolve into barracuda , they can not evolve into a human .
So ... humans are born with cancer cells already inside them ? I 'm not talking about what cancer does once it 's there , I 'm talking about what it does in the first place .
I 'm sure they 're concerned about the intended victim with the shotgun or the rifle just as much .
Why ? Because people like you are still pushing gun bans regardless of the Heller ruling ! It does n't help your side 's argument when your people continually talk about `` reasonable '' and `` common sense gun regulations '' and their examples include bans on `` assault weapons '' , semi-automatic firearms , `` armor piercing ammunition '' , `` high capacity magazines '' , waiting periods , mental health evaluations , fingerprinting and photographing of gun owners , permits , nationwide registration , etc . DC is a fine example of this . After Heller dissolved their gun laws they basically said `` Fine ! If it ca n't be 100 % impossible to get a gun in DC then we 'll make it 99.9999999 % impossible ! '' They did this through the enactment of so-called `` emergency legislation '' which violates the Heller ruling in every conceivable way . DC even sold out their home rule to California in the sake of having gun control . Do n't you dare forget that DC denied a woman the ability to register her legally owned handgun because it 's color scheme was n't on a list of approved firearms . People like you are continually demanding that magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition be banned , saying that nobody has a legal use for them and they 're used exclusively for killing large groups of people , or turning animals into meat paste . Yet at the same time you claim that `` Saturday Night Specials '' as you call them , are the preferred choice of criminals , and yet not one of these `` Saturday Night Specials '' is capable of holding more than 7 rounds of ammunition in their magazine . People like you continually talk about gun violence , but your answer to the question always involves more laws that only affect the law-abiding . This suggests that you 're either too stupid to live , or you have an absolute distrust of anyone who is n't a government working dog . Which is it that you fit into , stupid or paranoid ? Why does the slippery slope argument prevail ? Because to you anti-gunners nothing is ever good enough ! There are more than enough laws regulating every possible facet of gun ownership and possession and punish anybody for committing a criminal act , and to you that 's just not good enough !
Not really , this case was different in that the state was the guardian . Although I am sure it has happened before . As for three reasons ... 1 ) The state of Florida does n't believe a 13 yr old can have sex ( consent ) so why couold she be able to cosent to an abortion ? 2 ) The State is the guardian and they should be able to say where she can and ca n't go as a parent would be able to do ... .and the state has a law against taking kids to abortion clinics . 3 ) ABORTION IS KILLING A KID . Maybe that does n't matter for most : -/
It 's like the theory of the moon . We do n't know how the moon was created . Captured asteroid , knocked off in a big collision , formed from dust at the same time earth did ? We 're not sure . But the fact that we are n't sure of the details of how the moon was created in no way casts any doubt on the existence of the moon . We know evolution is a fact , that 's certain . Some of the details we 're still learning . Which forms of selection are the most important in what situation , enviromental factors influencing gene expression , the importance of cues picked up pre-nataly . These are all open questions . The fact that we have these questions in no way casts any doubts on the veracity of evolution , it just means that there 's still more to learn . That 's something that SS does n't get . If answers do n't come 100 % complete and tied up with a pretty bow he wants nothing to do with them .
I can . Americans won the Revolutionary War which was primarily a guerilla war .
I take it as read then that you 're not Catholic . Why do n't you believe in hell ? We are supposed to worship God because He is good , and it is right to praise goodness .
Add `` without her consent '' and you get my position .
If I 'm so pathetic why do n't you start debating my on my OP here . by the way , I could care less what evolutionists think of my posting habits . Come to think of it I may go find another board to post on .
Not sure why you think this is science or how it is supposed to apply to a discussion of creationism v evolution . Science is not materialistic but naturalistic .
Actually , the fiercest competition comes from within the same population . Not all organisms born can possibly survive .
That 's incorrect . The Constitution begins with Article 1 which does not contain the Bill of Rights . The Constitution contains seven articles which are followed by the Bill of Rights and the rest of the amendments . If you really are from England as you claim then I guess your lack of knowledge about the American Constitution is understandable .
It works .
Its a direct quote from Al Capone in the Kevin Coster version of the Untouchables . None of the alleged deaths have in fact occurred except for genetic determinism which has long been dead so long that there is not even a smell left . And somehow I do n't think you will find a proof of GOD in the fact that the genome is more complex than a simplistic point of view such as you apparently held prior to reading some of the newer findings .
Because conservatives take pleasure in people suffering .
It may take long enough that it wo n't be quite as moot as you think ...
So what does evolution stem from then ? did Darwin find an annoymous manuscript in his study one day entitled `` The Origin of the Species '' that had appeared out of nowhere ? Lets not try to paint up some new faces for paganism
Actually , that is factually incorrect . There have been several courthouse killings the last was in Atlanta where several guards were killed . Also , they 've been talking about arming flight attendants and pilots Because of problems on planes ( 911 , etc.. )
While I do n't appreciate your tone , you are correct in that I misunderstood the premise of this thread . The short answer is that I would have to be convinced that a soul exists and that a soul is injected at any point in the process of conception through labor . An unlikely situation given that I 'm an agnostic . Though I have said that I 'm amendable to banning 3'rd trimester abortions as a compromise . Loosely related to having my mind changed .
That , my friend , is where the wisdom of interpretation - makes sense of the data . For exa . : I really have no idea what the Federal GAO has for data , but , The wisdom of giving 850 Billion to a few bankers rather than the people who actually fuel the engine of this economy - eludes me . We have a large and powerful machine , but who is driving ? Very important IMHO .
And until they later contradict themselves their ruling is final , it does n't matter if it 's right or not , it 's the way it is . The subject is closed , individual rights has won out , the duty to the state has been executed for charges of treason .
GW Bush , just authorized the killing of US citizens overseas in the war against terrorism . There is no wording for preventing the CIA to extend that mission within the borders of the USA . In effect the CIA has license to kill anyone , without a trial , without due process , without oversight , and all in secret . Trusting the government means you trust politicians to tell the truth , always do what in in the public interest , will nerver lie , cheat , or steal . The politicians are the government .
And Creationists who ca n't tell the difference between cats and nuclear reactors do n't understand fluid mechanics .
Based on the experience of Theresa Burke as cited in her above-referenced book .
There will be more guns on the street whether the Court hears the case or not or regardless of how the Court might rule : gun laws dont effect criminals .
Well , stated that way , there is no problem with religion and evolution co-existing . Many evolutionary biologists are religious . Dr. Kenneth Miller of Brown U. is a practicing Christian and a respected evolutionary biologist . He engages in debates from time to time with creationists and ID proponents . There is little problem with the theories of evolution and most main-line religions around the world . The real debate is between a minority of United States fundamentalist christians and science in general . You have seen on this board that even though the theories of evolution are biological , several creationists have insisted that somehow there is a grand theory of evolution that includes the origin of the universe , the galaxies , the solar system , the planets , the earth , and life on earth . Typicaly , creationists claim that they do n't oppose science but only evolution - and by that they mean cosmology , astronomy , astrophysics , planetary physics , biochemistry , geology , most of physics ( relativity , quantum mechanics , thermodynamics ) , genetics , molecular biology , population genetics , embryology ( evo-devo ) , paleontology , paleoanthropology , and on and on . What is not opposed is trivial and limited that data upon which scientific theory is built , not the theories . So to answer the question can religion and evolution co-exist ? Without question . Evolutionary scientists do not study matters outside the domain of science . Science is naturalistic - methodological naturalism - and can not observe and study the supernatural . The supernatural can not be quantified . I have yet to see an equation that represents the power of God . That is not to claim that things outside of science do not exist or are not valid and important . It is just that science is not the proper tool for the study of such matters . Questions of faith and morals fall in other domains - theology and religion , for example . Can creationism and science co-exist ? Probably not . But the problem is not with science . It is with creationism . Creationism establishes its conclusions before any evidence is examined based on `` divine revelation . '' The problem arises when science , without regard to religion , uses the scientific method to arrive at conclusions that can not be reconciled with creationist conclusions . This makes science the evil work of Satan , and it means that scientists are trying to escape responsibility to a god based on primitive mythology .
You can believe what you want , your beliefs are not relevant to the issue .
You couldnt be more wrong . Our goverment was built on the word of God . Its ALL OVER our founding documents . George Washington was quoted to say `` You can not call yourself an American and subvert the word of God . '' Your only argument can go back to the sep.of church and state . Which is new compaired to when our laws were drafted . So not always ... just unfortuanatly now . Which is a BIG mistake by the way and could be the downfall of our country . Try again ...

YES , that is the answer to `` if God really exist NOW '' ! But the whole world people wo n't believe to that so simple and TRUE answer ! ! Jesus was such a Great liar of the world ! Up to now , still billions of people in the world believe in his lies ! !
Well , I think I will be sending Satan a snow shovel about now . We actually agree on something . It is `` inconceivable '' ( to quote `` the Princess Bride '' )
Because their axiom is that the bible is infallible , so any problems with reading it are the reader 's fault , whereas yours is that contradiction implies error . What Ken 's saying is that we ca n't draw a distinction between your axioms and those of a bible literalist in terms of which is 'right ' , because axioms are stated not proved : axioms define what is 'right ' . To reiterate : his error is in forgetting that the universe operates according to its own axioms , whatever they may be , and we can judge whether or not our axioms are congruent .
So the main disagreements between fundamentalists and theistic evolutionists are what are , and are not first ( primary ) causes . And atheists believe everything is a second cause ( or first cause ) with no intelligence behind it . It still does n't make any sense to me why theistic evolutionists are in such agreement with atheists , and so far apart from `` fundamentalists '' .
If I were to become upset merely because you told me the ideas were wrong , you might have a point . But I do n't ; never have , so far as I recall . An idea ca n't be stupid , or simple-minded . An idea can be right or wrong , or perhaps partly both . When you describe an idea as stupid , you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be stupid to think that . When you describe an idea as simple minded you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be simple-minded to think that .
Once again noting how you think that you should be the one to define what evolutionary biologists mean by the words they use . You want to lump all of science that you find in disagreement with you religion under one term , without making an honest effort to understand any of it .
So we can make machines to see better than we do ? I wonder what would happen if one of our machines dismantled something that Galileo or Einstein saw ?
I admit I did n't know who Sermonti was at first . A search on Wikipedia returned Ciacco , one of the characters of the Divine Comedy by Dante . a Google search led me to Giuseppe Sermonti who has written against evolution since 1980 . He is known for expressing the need for 'purpose ' to be part of science , giving such examples as : `` In the presence of the inducer ( lactose ) the cell produces an enzyme with the purpose of utilizing lactose4 ) . '' In case you never took biochemistry , this is an incredibly well understood chemical process and requires no purpose beyond the interaction of well understood chemicals .
And why do you pick that point ? What makes fusion an individual ? It doesnt start growing just because it was fused into a cell .
I think you are right on this one . People would reconsider when they are looking at that kind of penalty . I take the opposite view as you , thoug , I think this would simply encourage them to carry bigger , badder guns . If you are looking at life for robbing a bank , you may as well use a rocket launcher and an M-60 as use a handgun . This would virtually ensure that the police would not get you , as most police departments on the planet are not equipped to deal with heavy machine guns and rocket launchers . If hte penalty is the same though , why not ? People tend to miss the most obvious ( and most dangerous ) way to institute gun control That is to restrict the sale and manufacture of bullets . Without bullets , your gun is nothing but a paper weight . Bullets are also much more difficult to produce than guns . While they can be reloaded , casings are incredibly difficult to make on a small scale . The only way to really do it is to turn them down one at a time on a lathe . Dogs CAN be used to sniff out gunpowder and primers . This is a danger I think people miss when they start bannign certain types of ammunition . Right now , `` cop killer '' ammo is outlawed in the united states . Gun advocates laughed our butts off when they did this , since the `` cop killer '' amunition as they described it does not exist ouside of hollywood ( NO , coating a bullet with teflon will not enable it to pierce body armor , it will lubricate your barrel when you shoot it , though ) . I personally don ; t think this is anything to laugh about . BAnning guns is a stupid and unworkable plan , banning ammo could actually be dangerous .
What came first , trees or humans ? Genesis 1:12-31 `` And the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind , and the tree yielding fruit , whose seed was in itself , after his kind : And the evening and the morning were the third day ... And God said , Let us make man in our image ... And the evening and the morning were the sixth day '' vs. Genesis 2:5-9 `` And ever plant of the field before it was in the earth , and every herb of the field before it grew , for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth , and there was not a man to till the ground ... And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground ... And the lord God planeted a garden eastward of Eden and there he put the man who he had formed . And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight , and good for food '' One contracition , among thousands of inaccuracies . Unfortunately for your argument , the bible is a man-written text in support of faith , not reason . It does not need to make sense , it is interepereted , in support of a particular faith , which is hopefully something that gives you comfort , and NOT something that interferes with reason in your daily life . I see from your posts it IS interfering , wheras I see other religious poster who seem to have no problem having faith for their own benefit , but do not attempt to mix the two ( reason and faith ) . -Mach
1984 , huh ? I 'm sure that is all still very relevant . Actually there is a lot of discussion about the nature of Archaeopteryx . Much of it deals with whether it could fly and what it teaches us about how birds came to fly - ground up or trees down . But what they all agreed on , even back then , was that Archaeopteryx is a transitional . Taxonomic debates are n't really very meaningful , really . Creationists like to make a big deal about the fact that most taxonomists and ornithologists classify Archaeopteryx as a bird . But where else would it go ? That 's a limitation of the Linnean classification system - everything is put somewhere , even if it does n't exactly fit . The only debate about the evolution of Archaeopteryx among experts is whether it evolved from theropod dinorsaurs or from archosaurs . It 's still a transitional .
How about : A woman wakes up to find herself connected to a body . A body without a brain , which is using her own organs to be alive . Doctors are preparing to transplant a brain from a dying violinist into this new one connected to her and the date is set in the future . Would it be morally correct to disconnect herself and kill this body that has no identity , mind , consciousness or existence in actuality ?
So neither is a failure , and neither is ultimately true . In reality , one is true and one is false . Faith is n't enough , when they clash politically . One will lose , and one will win . There is a huge gap in this persons reasoning . Why is it that atheists seem to have more respect for this type of creationist than they do for others - others who do n't regard what atheists in science produce as unquestionable evidence ? It seems to be the same for Kurt Wise . A quick google search turns up these Dawkins remarks about Mr . Wise ;
Let 's clean up our terminology . `` Color '' is just our brains ' way of comprehending wavelength of light , so instead of saying `` color , '' let 's say `` wavelength . '' You took Kronus 's statement as meaning that we can make machines that can see wavelengths that we ca n't see with our eyes . This is true .
It was my understanding that the tread is about the hypocrisy of those who want to defend marriage from the inclusion of gay people .
And if I google `` christian loch ness monster '' , I 'll get some hits too ... None of the gays here are calling it a `` right '' . You 're trying to make hay out of thin air on the issue of what it is `` called '' . The actual `` right '' involved is the right to EQUAL PROTECTION . A constitutional right which mandates that people are free from unwarranted discrimination . And preventing gays from adopting is clearly unwarranted .
So Miller says that ID is less worthy , scientifically , than even Young Earth Creationism ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
They can go somewhere ( feel the heat ) but law school would not be my first choice .
I think your questions could be considered in a theological context . We 're taught that we are a `` special creation '' , made in God 's image . Then as a added bonus he gave us dominion over other animals , which is a great source of boastfulness for some people ( Consider the pride of a man , his chest swelling as he contemplates his intellectual superiority over a billy goat , for instance ) . This combination allows for the thinking that humans are n't natural in this world and are somehow above it all IMO , which leads to your observation of `` arrogance '' .
Nope . Chemical evolution has nothing to do with life . It has to do with changes that chemicals undergo when combined under certain conditions . The science of the origin of life is called abiogenesis . Life is a precondition of evolution . If you wish to claim that `` POOF - my god did it '' is the source of that life , then that does n't argue for or against evolution . [ quote ] 3 . Biological evolution , explains how a single-celled creature could evolve into the range of creatures we observe today by naturalistic means ( evidence for this : transitional forms - if I am wrong , then why is the transitional fossil argument still used by many evolutionists ? ) . [ /qote ] While you claim to be seeing the big picture , you actually have a very restricted idea of evolution . Evolution is a change in the frequencies of alleles in a population over time . Unless you can apply that to the big bang , changes in chemicals , and even the origin of life , you are not talking about evolution . You are trying to apply your misunderstanding the the science of biology . You are demanding that you should be able to define what biologists mean by the vocabulary they use .
You left out a couple of things , though , which makes your post less reliable . But so nobody gets confused or deceived , here is more accurate statistics : http : //www.plannedparenthood.org/lib ... 2Services.html -- -- Service No . of Procedures Referrals Reversible Contraceptive Clients  Women 2,208,483 Emergency Contraception Clients 633,756 Tubal Sterilization Clients 680 Reversible Contraceptive Clients  Men 60,476 Vasectomy Clients 2,522 Abortion Procedures 227,375 HIV Testing Clients  Women 126,477 HIV Testing Clients  Men 48,991 Prenatal Clients 15,860 Infertility Clients 325 Colposcopy Procedures 31,248 Cryotherapy Procedures 3,913 LOOP/LEEP Procedures 1,781 Midlife Clients 10,575 Pregnancy Tests 1,081,772 Breast Exams/Breast Care 1,062,727 Adoption ( Referred Out ) 1,963 Primary Care Clients 24,483 STI Procedures , Women and Men 1,255,036 Other Services  Women 58,626 Other Services  Men 17,905 Totals 6,873,011 Total Unduplicated Clients 2,744,554 - In 2002 , more than 1,500 affiliate staff and volunteer educators provided nearly 101,000 educational programs to more than 1.4 million people of all ages and in a variety of settings - more than 6,500 training programs were provided by 117 affiliate staff and volunteers to more than 66,000 professionals who work with children , teens , and young adults - In 2002 , plannedparenthood.org logged more than 720,000 visits per month and teenwire®.com received approximately 400,000 visits per month and replied to more than 500 personal inquiries a week . PPFA also produced and distributed more than two million consumer health pamphlets . The Katharine Dexter McCormick Library responded to more than 3,000 research and information requests from researchers , sexual health professionals , and the general public -- -- So your claim about their abortions being more in number than their other services , well that just turned out to not be true .
Oh ? They 're trained to deal with irate exhusbands who are stabbing their wives and dousing them in gasoline , in broad daylight , in the middle of a busy parking lot ? They 're trained to deal with that specific kind of # # # # every single day ?
OH MY GOD ! You 're in an abortion debate and you do n't even know what a ZEF is ? What a joke ! You have just lost all credibility . Please wait for the ride to come to a complete stop before attempting to exit .
I once walked into Halbergs office in an effort to borrow a big XY plotter his group had available . Before I left he overwhelmed me with an extended lecture on chronobiology and his current work as well as a large sheath of reprints and reviews . A very vocal advocate of his field ( and it WAS his field ) and quite a character . Of course I met him in the morning and perhaps he was on a chronobiological peak at the time who can say . Anyway I did get access to the plotter for some chemical work I was doing , and I learned a bit about his work and interests . Productive meeting .
Yes . He a complete fraud . Why ?
Hey now ! Yes , yes , I know it is , but take it easy , I live here ya know .
Thank you for pointing this out Simone . I will write a stern latter to the Tanzanian authorities straight away !
What does `` hangs on nothing '' mean ? Really , what does it mean ? In context ? Your interpretation ? Do you think the Earth `` hangs on nothing '' ?
Which is why your computer does n't work , right ?
Well that 's one way to put it Give me the knife and tell me where to cut , I 've been practicing with my vacuum cleaner all afternoon archangel
Finally someone answered the question . Thanks . I thought it might be the government . Does your government attempt to do this ? What do you think about other democratic nations that have citizens that are less armed ? Do you think that they 're in danger - or is it only the American government that 's out to do this ?
The state right before the Big Bang did n't have H , He , or any space .
Not even the scientists claim to know how it happened . Abiogenesis is the science that studies the possibilities . It is far more reasonable to conclude that life arose naturally than that it was a miracle by some magical being who did something somewhere some time in the past .
Actually , that 's not true . The standard upon which the `` super accurate atomic clocks '' are based is slightly different from the actual rotation of the earth . It is as if you had two clocks that kept time slightly differently . I have to adjust the time on my grandfather clock all the time - every time I raise the weights I reset it to the correct time . It used to keep pretty good time and require resetting only about every six months but it broke and I had to replace the works . It has taken a good six months to adjust the speed to the point that it is now off by only about a minute/week . I 'm still adjusting . That 's what is happening with the `` leap seconds '' that occur from time to time . The adjustment is primarily to sync up two clocks keeping slightly different times , one of which is very accurate , the other of which varies and is slowing at the rate of 0.005 sec/year/year .
First , the universe is currently though to be between 13.5 and 14 billion years old . Second , what is this `` gap '' you 're talking about ?
The thread was quickly shut down by the forum because :
Really ? Why do n't you name a few of those mutations and explain why they are more harmful .
Not if they are so bad that the person does n't live long enough to reproduce . Evolution is a very wasteful process and self-correcting to a certain extent . Plus , not all bad mutations are life threatening .
Well , I just do n't see this . It 's an observable fact that species produce far more progeny than can possibly hope to survive . Consequently , the grim reaper will take most of them before they can breed -- which is NS in action . There is absolutely nothing implausible about variation being random , with only those variants that are compatible with environmental conditions having a chance of success . The rest you just would n't see .
I think it is simply been more socially acceptable for women to cry openly .
And Moore could n't give a reason for why Heston should apologize for the death of that one child either . How about you apologize for the deaths of everyone from Chicago , because you do n't support programs that would lock away gang members and take them off the streets ?
I forgive you .
Sure .
Actually , this guy was an ex-con . It 's illegal for a convicted felon to own firearms . Galileo actually helped us more than he helped you . This proves once again that criminals will always refuse to surrender their weapons .
At least your husband and yourself survived the adventure . Only one became a victim by the adorably nice people `` inside '' the building . Ironic . What motivated the evil mean people outside the building ? Hatred for you ? A person they have never met ? Or concern for a life that they have never met ? You willingness to kill your baby removes any surprise that one might have at your desire to slap the faces of people concerned for the welfare of `` your '' child .
Yes ... . 10 % of the population has a disorder ( homosexuality ) that they refuse to deal with in the proper way do to the fact they believe that the majority should just except there so called `` sexual orientation '' and treat it like it is as normal as a traditional relationship between a man and a woman . I 'm sorry , but I can not except this concept that your `` orientation '' is on the same playing field as mine . It is not . Abdominable and wrong behavior do not deserve rights .
But of course . Why would n't creationists call for carbon 14 dating on inappropriate samples ? But there is actually no need to do so since the fossils have been reliably dated to around 68 million years by other means . By the way , I said that Dr. Schweitzer had n't been mistreated , but I was wrong . Here is an article that talks about it .
Nice succinct summary on the state of affair with liberal journalism today .
Oh really ? What evidence do you have ? These people started out as soldiers in the army .
We can assume that our solar system formed merely by matter coalescing by gravity and then behaving the way matter behaves when it 's all clumped together by gravity . We can model it on a computer and if we get something that looks like our current solar system then we can say that the model is a good one and the chances that the solar system formed that way are increased . No , sorry , there is no proof , only explanations and models .
Yes , that does seem to be the primary concern , and it does seem to be that the the cost of the program could be considerable . However , I do ask again that you at least consdier the following , presented by the Center for Gun Policy and Research , part of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health . ( Link on an above post . ) ... the costs of creating , maintaining , and using a federal system are likely to be substantial . The projected costs of the system must be weighed against the potential to reduce the enormous social and economic costs associated with gun violence . Eighty lives per dayalmost 29,000 per yearare lost to gun violence in the United States.16 The social costs of gun violence in the United States have been estimated to be an extraordinary $ 100 billion per year.17 If ballistic fingerprinting laws result in significant reductions in gun violence by strengthening law enforcement efforts to identify and prosecute violent offenders and deterring illegal gun use by and transfers to criminals and youththe investment will be well worth it . Also , -In 1994 , the lifetime medical costs associated with firearm injuries and deaths totaled $ 2.3 billion . - Approximately 49 % of the costs of gun-related injuries and deaths is paid by the public . -The hospitalization costs associated with firearm-related injuries in 1997 exceeded $ 800 million . -Thirty percent ( 30 % ) of hospitalized patients were uninsured , and an additional 30 % were enrolled in government health insurance programs . -The direct costs ( e.g. , medical , productivity ) and social costs ( e.g. , quality of life , emotional ) of gun violence are an estimated $ 100 billion per year Like I have , said , it seems that perhaps not enough research has been done , to figure out precisely what the program will cost , and how how effective it would be . But I am suprised that there are those who seem so set against even considering such a program , when it appears that there may be a substantial benefit .
382 - 405 are the dates I have , under Pope Damasus I .
You mean you are not going to pretend to you understand it . It means that your argument stating that flaws in the death penalty lay in the judicial system is like me saying that flaws in life imprisonment lay in our prison 's security system ; not in the punishment itself . It is also like saying that the problem of releasing guilty persons sentenced to life in prison lays with the judicial system , not with the punishment of life in prison . Understand yet ?
And yet SS according to you they say .
'Nephilim ' and 'giants ' are usually interchangeable . The sons of Anak are indeed said to be descendants of the Nephilim and some of the Philistines were indeed said to be sons of Anak ( notably Goliath ) .
You show me the post where I said I thought terrorists killing children was a good idea and I will eat my keyboard .
I think its actually the states job ... the judiciary does need to overturn Roe v. Wade to get this done though ... which does n't mean it becomes illegal .
a suicide is a suicide by what ever means
And there it is in black and off-white : you ca n't find any fault with common descent or evolution , so you shoehorn in something to which evolution does not speak . Evolution is not about origin of first life . Take it off the table . Now look again . Earliest forms of life : single cells . Then simple agglomerations ( sponges ) , then progressively more specialisation ( flatworms ) , and on and on and on . Evolution . A nested hierarchy of forms and genetics . Atavisms . Vestigial features . The evidence is all right there , yet because we have n't yet reached back three and a half billion years and created an accurate pre-cellular picture ( you really ought to check out protocells though ) you declare the whole edifice insubstantial . That 's like saying we should acquit a murderer because the tens of thousands of pieces of evidence indicating his guilt mean nothing if we ca n't tell how many cornflakes he had for breakfast . Ok , it 's not quite like that . Obviously the origin of life is a fascinating subject and not an insignificant detail . Let me rephrase , then : the murderer commited his crime with a weapon whose origin is indeterminate . So far , nobody has a full picture of how the murderer came by this weapon . Fascinating , intriguing , important even - but irrelevant to the question of whether he commited the crime , for which the evidence is overwhelming .
Really ! You can prove that most pro-lifers do n't care about women ? ... it is idiotic thinking like this that makes me respect you less and less .
No , it 's often an emotional show . They choose their families based on submitted videos , usually from families with one or more physically challenged members , then they build them a house to fit their needs . There was one in particular with a blind autistic boy who loved to swing . The joy on his face when he got the new swing would make any sensitive person weep with joy for him . There was another about a deaf couple whose new home included and lot of strobe light signaling systems . BTW , alcohol is a depressant !
And again , how is this relevant to a discussion of science as opposed to `` creation science ? '' What does virtue have to do with it ? To be honest , I have never been impressed by the superior virtue of christians anyway . The highest divorce rate of any population in the country is among born again christians ( Gallup ) . I have n't been divorced and have never cheated on my wife . Who is more virtuous ?
You are just playing dumb , right ? There will be fewer technicians and fewer orders for equipment PER INSURED . Their pay will not be cut . There will be fewer of them PER INSURED . Initially the absolute volume will increase .
Questions I asked in a previous post , but to which I have never received a reply : Does God have genitalia ? Why would he ? To what possible purpose ? Does He have legs and feet ? Why ? What does he have to walk on ? How about nipples ? A navel ? A digestive tract ? An anus ? Lungs ? Why would a non-corporeal being need any of these ? Why would an all-seeing being have eyes that limit him to seeing only forward as we do , especially before he 'd even created Light ? God was made in Man 's image , not the other way around .
While you 're at it , maybe you can talk Mr Wonderful into debating me formally on the benefits of gays vs the benefits of Christianity in the world today . I could use the practice .
So a theory was revised ... does that mean that it was wrong afterwards ?
** Why not ? Why would you doubt me ? Unfortunately for your express denial of the materialist metaphysic as the philosophical view that informs the opinions you are trying to promote , that denial is worse than dubious , it 's ridiculous . Quote : Here you reveal exactly what I 've just spoken of -- you assume that science and the scientific method equates to , is synonymous with , materialism/mechanism . It most certainly is not . Nor is the accompanying assumption , i.e. , that any science which does not strictly adhere to materialust/mechanist assumptions , is not , and can not be , real science . Equally untrue .

And irrational emotional appeals seldom hold up in the face of logic
Know it .
Exactly so . Pro-choice people would not impose their values on anyone ; profetallifers would impose theirs on every woman of child bearing age .
But we wo n't know until you present some sort of evidence , some ideas that are n't anti-science , will we ? There was no claim of knowing everything . So please , present some `` sound arguments . '' Explain to us how events that happened thousands , or millions of years ago are not an example of the deceit of your god .
Well , we do , actually . That is why we send the woman for numerous OB checks throughout the pregnancy .
I 'm not moving the goal posts , this is just your attempt at intellectual dishonesty . Heller was about an individual right protected in the Constitution , Dred Scott was n't . Therefore these two cases are n't comparable anymore than cotton candy and scrap metal .
Why not ? My mother has been 39 , for the last 39 years .
Yet rather than support his extraordinary claims with any defense that stands up to the slightest scrutiny , supersport once again spams us with another brand new thread saying the same thing that he 's had refuted time and time again on countless forums ... ( No , seriously ; do a search , both on this site and on others . I 'm not kidding . )
No problem with it ? You dream about it
Even if the number of defensive uses is only 800,000 a year , that 's still a rate of more than 53 to 1 when compared to the number of homicides committed with a firearm .
And so what ? I do n't think we rank ( yet ) along the lines of the Phillipines , Slovakia or Mexico . Does that mean we are supposed to be grateful as standards keep dropping further down ? Besides , the latest Thomson Reuters Survey shows that 60 % of Americans want a public option included in the healthcare reform legislation . That number , of course , does n't include those who would scrap the legislation entirely as a better approach for achieving single payer . Since the public option in the current legislation appears so weak , at this point .
But you have heard of ID , right ? And you think that ID - pushed by the Discovery Institute - is somehow science ?
You know better than that . There are several misinformed posters on this forum who would argue that point 'til the cows come home .
Yes absolutely remember that polygamous marriage is not only biblical but also the biblical norm . People should be free to form any type of family structure they want to .
To be honest I would n't mind too much missing old age ... ( whenever that starts ) .
Well , the 40Ar/39Ar method was used to say that it was 65 mya . This same method was used to date volcanic rock from the Mt . Vesuvius eruption to within 7 years . But the KT boundary was dated using several radiometric methods that all agree to within a couple of million years . Here is where I got that info : http : //www.ncseweb.org/resources/rnc ... 12_30_1899.asp Look at table 2 .
Come on now . We all know that the French Army was capable of dropping their rifles just as fast as the Italians in WWII .
Today 's students are tomorrow 's scientists . They are unlikely to study something that , if they hear about it at all , they hear about it on a less serious level than they do the happenstance origins of atheist evolution . To reduce ID to other classes like literature or social sciences , etc . ( where poetry , fiction , and prehistoric beliefs are the subject matter ) is nothing more than a clever , dishonest attempt to belittle it .
But it is OK to teach your religion in public school classrooms ? Is that what you mean ? What about my religion . Is it OK for me to teach it to your children against your will ?
Yet you have defined what unknowable is , therefore you know something of it ; that it is unknowable . Not only that , I notice you 've leapt away from the claim it does n't exist . But then , you must make the assumption that everything is knowable , if there 's nothing unknowable . How do you show this ? Well so far you 've claimed that science MIGHT one day know everything about you . What a hoot .
Well since Bush took office the mantra has bee `` Local Control '' has it not . Apparently the people of your state want whats happening . Local control in action . Rejoice in your victory .
That is not necessarily true . I have known girls who have gotten pregnant and wanted an abortion but the fathers of the babies told them they did n't want them to have an abortion so the did n't and now the baby is healthy .
No . I 'll type slowly so I do n't get ahead of you this time . Follow with your finger and move your lips if no one is watching . Scientists get to define what they mean by the scientific words that they use . Not you and not your preacher . Do I get to define what you mean by the word `` prayer ? '' Why not ?
Arguments are infinite , your time is not , Slave . This claim is opposed to Real Ultimate Truth . Go back and beg Society to take pity on you , Slave .
What do you want evidence for ? Helpful mutations ? The theory that life evolves ? I believe that I have provided enough evidence .
Because electricity moves faster than a man 's arm ? Give me one example of this actually happening and I 'll concede that it 's not a ridiculous thing to consider .
I believe I wrote several times that I am not arguing against the rational theory of evolution .
Well , he ca n't continue getting things right for long ...
So on what day did he create time on . Its not mentioned anywhere in the biblical text which seems to simply assume time .
I remember that now , but it must have slipped my mind when I was writing the above ...
Wrong again . Some are beneficial . Is this another failure to grasp the basics or another misrepresentation ?
No . I have a beautiful wife and three grown daughters - I do n't wish for no more . ( That 's Texan for : I have no desire for more . ) BTW - Welcome aboard
Well , we ca n't question your loyalty ... that 's for sure . I can question your `` facts '' which are wrong and I suspect it is because you get them from a biased website . You 'd think people would stop paying attention to biased websites after they never provide a good argument but whatever . In any event , single-payer has roughly a 40 % level of support from the last poll I 've found on pollingreport.com . Now continue your mantra .
As I said the gene was from its inception a theoretical construct developed to explain certain observations on pea plant characteristics . A convenience in describing how the traits were observed to be inherited . Its never been hard linked to any specific molecular architecture except for the short period of the one-gene one-enzyme ( or protein ) hypothesis . The concept grows more and more complex at the molecular level , but it also remains viable as a means of describing and studying the heritable elements underlying phenotypic traits at the conceptual level . Thats a tribute to the initial mental feat of Mendel in coming up with the original concept ! By the way there are no points or lines or squares or circles etc . Geometry must be dead do n't ya think ?
Proof is a matter of math and booze . So , if you agree with Ursus maritimus , do you agree with me ?
Negative reinforcement works very well at teaching impulse control . After all , arresting and jailing criminals is a negative reinforcement , so why not start it earlier in life ? We 're already getting our kids adjusted to prison life , what with sending them to schools with metal detectors , drug sniffing dogs , security guards , lockdown procedures and bars on the windows . Maybe if they were more likely to experience a burning sting to the backside for being naughty , then perhaps they 'd be less willing to do something bad later in life . And another thing for you , Simone . If kids are so impulsive and driven by hormones , then why oh why would we ever allow them to actually get a driver 's license ? Are we to believe that at 16 , a child is perfectly capable of controlling their testosterone driven impulses and not plow a two ton vehicle into a crowd going at 85 mph . Yet the same individual , at 21 , is absolutely unable to control their impulses when they pick up a gun , and they 'll fire into a crowd for no good reason ?
What do you not understand ? Homo Erectus left Africa as well as stayed . You 're under a idiotic notion that there was a exodus out of Africa . The simplest answer is that some H Es stayed in Africa and were around cohabitating with Sapiens until a 100,000 or so years ago . Do you understand the concept of Occzam 's razor ? http : //www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA005.html you 're wrong as usual .
Actually , it can . The zygote does n't always develop into an adult human being . In fact , about 60-70 % of all zygotes never implants or gets rejected and end up being flushed down the toilet . And of those who do implant , some turn into blighted ovums or hydatidiform moles . So no , your claim is not as all-encompassing as you want to present it . [ quote ] Conception/fertilization is the time in which this physical entity comes into existence . Prior to that time , this unique physical entity did not exist . [ quote ] Which is also true after ANY cell division of any kind , and as such again is a rather meaningless point .
So it 's shifted from `` no new structures '' to `` I can think of a structure that ca n't evolve . '' Me too . Evolutionary theory says that some things are not possible to evolve . But new structures , as you learned , do evolve .
Uncited , unreferenced , altered , and out of context quotes are generally ignored .
You mean a strawman logic fallacy , right ? Yeah that would require me using a statement not a question . But at least you tried .
Ok , what about the black baby in the womb ? ?
oh my , sigma , you have n't posted in awhile . Illegal as in reaching beyond their power to make this decision .
** This , of course , is completely wrong , since all we ever hear from morning 'til nite is that , according to the population genetist prevailing norion of evolution , Darwinian evolution does not work on individuals but only on 'populations ' ! ! Social classes and groups divided by skin colour or cultural norms are as much , 'populations ' , as ever there were . Class warfare is every bit a part of Darwinian cut-throat , competitive , war of all against all in order to acquire large stocks of scarce resourses for oneself and 'people like us ' , as any other off-shoot of laissez-faire capitalism or feudal land-grabbing or any other form of of institutionalised , legalised , inequality . To this very day it is used over and over again to block social and economic reform by blaming the victim of property laws set up to preserve elitism by inheritance instead of individual talent and effort , and to deprive the disadvantaged of the benefits that should be theirs by simple membership in the commonwealth . OTH , Lamarckian evolution is a matter of individual organisms surviving , thriving , and reproducing by their own individual efforts , regardless of anything any other organism around them is doing to adapt to the stimuli of a vitally and chronically , randomly altered environment .
Well the premise you claim is not the core premise of evolution . Indeed Darwin never invoked genes at all . He did make the observation that some variability was clearly inherited ( but not all variability ) , he also observed that some variants survived and reproduced better than others . From this he concluded that natural selection operated to change the heritable traits exhibited by populations , and extended this to resulting in large changes over long times . Changes sufficient to result in new species which were reproductively isolated or nearly so . To an actual Darwinist genes did not enter the theory at all - they were not known at the time except to an obscure Monk who published in a less than prominent journal ! As to a fish morphing into a human without any genetic alterations ... . Produce a case where that has happened and we can discuss it in depth . Till then I will claim that such a transformation can not be accomplished without alteration of the underlying genome . I am most dubious that you have any such example at hand .
Thus , 'virtually ' . I am familiar with KY and IN legalistics . But , your point is taken . The slack can also be covered for by the adoptor of the child on a case by case basis .
Yes , I do .
I know what moral relativism is ( although you should be aware it has multiple meanings ) ; I do n't know what the sentence :

If you do n't mind , could you just outline your paradigm please ? and also , when you say you have experience , do you mean in `` real '' debating ( HS and College ) or just on this and other sites ?
How can the Bible be used as a source while you deny the truth of its claims ? What parts of the Bible are true , and how do you disguingish between the information that is true and not true ? I wonder how a modern court would view the testimony of 500 credible witnesses to a supernatural event ?
it is no `` story '' ... ... ..i am debating on the whole evolution thing ... look at the facts . so many great ppl , physics people , niels bohr , he was for evoulution , then he found out all of the facts that it is junk , so he became a christian
`` restrictions '' of an inalienable right is something to be proud of ? Most would call it treason . Are you an advocate of treason ? Of course you are ! Whatever are you going to do when the SCOTUS reaffirms and incorporates the right in every State Constitution as has already been done in every civil rights case and even in Roe V. Wade ? The clock is ticking so rant and propagandize all you want because it will not stop a right clearly stated in the Constitution .
So should people also look for more neucleotides and more planets within Mercury 's orbit ? The list of things that people could look for goes on and on . You have provided two examples of the hypothesis that assumed the fewest number of things being wrong . I can provide many more of it being right . Shall I ?
This is bigger then your realize . Prop 8 goes down on equal protection grounds then all state constitutional amendments go down .
I did n't answer or you did n't understand ? Actually I did answer . The knee joint I described is from a bipedal hominid - there is no question about it . The skull , even though I gave it very ape-like features , is from a biped . There are many examples of what I described .
I wonder why you keep posting these pointless threads . This statement is beyond idiotic . No , that is not why we 're pro choice , at least not all of us .
He did not .
I taught myself . Like gays teach themselves .
Yes , it recognizes there will be religion in our country , it allows all to follow which ever religion suits that individual as long as it does not impose upon others who do not follow that religious system . Our constitution allows for dissent , opposition and opinions . It actually requires such dissent in order to come to conclussions which would serve everyone equally . If for some reason there is a practice which excludes certain individuals from the protections of the law , then it needs to be challenged .
they do n't want to except that there is something/someone more powerful than them
First off , Congratulations are in order ( HUGZ ) ! As for a ceremony : If were to ever get married , I think it would be relatively small ( 50 to 100 people max ) and out in a an open meadow ( weather permitting ) , or at least a lush green park or back yard . My partner and I would escort each other up the aisle in matching grey tuxes , to a simple platform with a white garden archway decorated in white flowers , where a justice of the peace presides over a simple ceremony . We would read vows to one another and then be pronounced partners in life , and then just have a fabulous garden party . How doeas that sound ?
It is n't a fraud . Why would you say that ? And it is n't evidence for evolution , it is an observation of evolution . The allele frequency of the moths changed ( twice ) over time . The most reasonable explanation seems to be that it was the result of natural selection . Natural selection is one of several mechanisms of evolution .

o_c hit the nail on the head . The intent is to encourage sexual responsibility . The problem is that this is what Planned Parenthood does . These numbskull protesters have their idea of what sexual responsibility is : abstinence outside of marriage . The problem is that this is a pipe dream ; you wo n't stop people from having sex using threats and scare tactics . Instead , the only thing this fearmongering accomplishes is scaring people into being caught with contraceptives by authority figures , so they do n't have any ... but they still have sex . Contrastingly , PP encourages proper and effective contraception and sexual health . Only an XXXXX ca n't see which one goes farther toward preventing the abortions that those XXXXXX are protesting in the first place .
** Sheer nonsense . What couints is the functioning of the system as a whole . Reducing it to subsytems , and those subsystems to material and mechanical components , is a task subordinate to the principal , primary objective , i.e. , an understanding of the whole , what is it that it is , why it does what it does , and how it does it . Only you anthropocentrically expand your psychological understanding of connotations of words pertaining to human social systems to all other systems , everywhere . But that is , of course , what you guys did when first you applied the term 'selection ' to the behaviour of abstractions and other non-human entities , so no big surprise there , I guess .
This is a false assertion . In our society , a woman is not obligated to care for a child after it is born , this is why adoption and safe-haven laws exist . The situation is different enough between a fetus and a born child that a direct moral comparison is impossible in this way .
I believe you are thinking of orders , not denominations . There is a big difference . Strict and loony ? Could you be a little more specific , because this statement sounds like it 's coming out of complete ignorance . You also seem to be making the assumption that all of the non-Catholic Christians are somehow very similar , which could n't be further from the truth .
The same God that created a troll like you .
Creationsists may call it a museum , but in reality in it a mythology theme park .
# 1 is above . The Jesus myth came out of Hellenistic Judaism already heavily imbued with the ideas of the suffering servant ( Isaiah 53 ) and the son of God subject to a shameful death ( Wisdom of Solomon Let us condemn him with a shameful death ) . Paul refers to the archons , the evil heavenly rulers of the age , as those who crucified Jesus ( 1 Cor 2:8 ) and extols the justice of the Romans ( Ro . 13:1-3 ) . The earliest layers of Q material do not refer to a death or resurrection ( Kloppenborg ) . No earthly Jesus , no crucifixion , no death . It is all myth , man .
Well , I thought I did . Perhaps you did n't understand . We can look at the rings of a tree to determine how old it is . We can also determine other things , such as relative lengths of growing seasons and times of catastrophies . If I were to cut down a tree just after it was `` created , '' I would be able to infer a growth pattern and relative seasonal information.. even though there was no growth pattern and there were no seasons . In the same way , if we look at a star that is 10 billion light years away , we are seeing the events that happened at that star 10 billion years ago . If this creationist `` response '' is correct , and the light we see did n't originate 10 billion years ago , what is the light telling us ? It 's telling us a story of stellar events that never happened . That 's like writing a history book about events that never took place ... Or at the very least , that would be like someone reading my daily journal of the events that took place in my life millions of years before I was born . Unless you can explain why we would see this false information , this response leaves you stuck with a trickster God . Moreover , true to SkepticGunt 's word , this view is unscientific because it is completely unfalsifiable . `` Because that 's how God made it '' is not a scientific claim .
No , thats not right . Evolution only deals with the diversification of life , not its origins , and most certainly not the origin of the universe . As typically defined , evolution is descent with modification -- or in equivalent population genetics terms -- change in allele frequency in a population over time .
Bless your heart , Lurch . heidi
I disagree . I 've been in a loving , committed relationship for 25 years to the same person exclusively ... how does this have a negative affect on you ?
Yes , but if true it would certainly make the investigation go easier and the repair of other bridges faster and cheaper . Ban gay marriage - your bridges never collapse - imagine that !
Just out of interest , which version of creation are you talking about ?
Of course it is based on the evidence , as is creation . They are both different interpretations about the same evidence that are ultimately determined by a person 's underlying assumptions or belief systems . But we can reason that there must be God by way of observing the beauty and design all around us , the truth of the Bible , etc . All of these things only imply that a creator exists . We see a computer program , we know it needs a programmer . In a similar way , we see the highly complex DNA system , we must reason , coming to a similar conclusion that it needs a Designer .
You did n't answer the question ... .what is your standard for intelligence ? You also incorrectly use my logic .
Ah , if you 'd just waited fifteen minutes , you would n't have posted this scathing accusation of unfairness before I explained precisely why your accusation is nothing but fabrication . Oh well , maybe you 'll eat your humble pie without making a fuss ... but I wo n't hold my breath .
What you must realize is that is the case for evolution as well , we do n't have enough evidence to know ; this is common in science but it is only the political drive of Darwinism that found that state unacceptable . ( you do n't see them teaching kids about black holes and unified field theory because we do n't know much about it )
Actually , creation explains nothing . Evolution is an observation that is explained by theories that explain why populations of animals change . One explanation is the theory of natural selection .
Confused ? First you say you do n't believe in killing children unless it 's `` absolutly ( sic ) necessary '' , then you say you ca n't imagine a time that it would be absolutely necessary . Ca n't you make up your mind ?

If it happened in a 'very short period of time ' , I do n't see how , by definition , we can call it 'gradual ' . I guess that your intention is to characterise this finding as a small , short-term change in a population 's gene pool . I further guess that the term 'micro-evolution ' is hovering not far from your typing fingers , to be coupled with an assertion that while 'micro-evolution ' is possible , 'macro-evolution ' is not . I will not speculate further , but will await your responses to my guesses .
But that does n't make Creationism correct either .
But even worse , even if there were some unknown mechanism to cause such movement , it would generate heat . The heat generated by the creation of the mountains of the world would be more than enough to reduce the entire surface to molten lava . Add to that the fact that the condensation of the `` vapor canopy '' would release enough heat to boil all of the water on earth .
But the point is that the Razor should not be used to test hypotheses ! That is n't what Ockham stated the Razor as . The whole point is that you ca n't use this warped version of the Razor for hypothesis testing . In the example , impetus was a hypothesis for a cause for movement . Ockham eliminated the hypothesis as a description of the phenonmenon . The Razor states that the animal was struck . Period . From that observations you make hypotheses as to what struck the animal . Hi_Its_Me listed only 2 of the possible hypotheses . Then , without testing either hyopothesis , he eliminated one as `` unlikely '' and used `` unlikely '' to = false . But there was not testing . Yet testing is not only possible but easy . Last year my daughter 's car hit a deer . The deer 's carcass was n't found but it would have had pieces of glass embedded in it . Testing those pieces would show that they came from the windshield of a Pontiac Sunfire . That eliminates the alien spaceship hypothesis . ( Unless you propose the ad hoc hypothesis that the spaceship coincidentally had glass identical to that of a Pontiace Sunfire . However , that ad hoc hypothesis ca n't be independently tested and is therefore invalid ) .
If Obama and his admin.really believes it , or as you say use it for their own agenda ( not quote unquote ) .then maybe we are lost in a swamp.A swamp on the eve of 1861.Oh by the way did anyone mention which corner gun store or gun show ( ca n't forget the gun show now ) where all those hand grenades were bought ?
Can you state that in English ? What does that mean ?
It ca n't come up with evidence if it 's suppressed from future generations . Until you can show that happenstance origins are science , you have no basis to declare that intelligent design is not science . I agree that I have n't shown how ID has a potential advantage to the political corruptness of today 's scientific community , but I 've shown it 's potential advantage to our society . I 've shown how thinking is involved with it , the type of thinking involved in any school class involving philosophy , which you said science classes should have .
So claimeth the troll . Proven wrong by NUMEROUS research articles . http : //www.apa.org/pi/l & amp ; gref.html
So before `` we invented '' the laws of logic they did not exist ? Something could be itself and not itself at the same time , before `` we invented '' the law of non-contradiction ?
That begs the question , do you feel the New Testament is useful ? As far as useful it did teach that you should wash after touching a dead body . Until a Creationist popularized the idea many died needlessly . It also begs the question , what are the social benefits of Darwinism ?
But surely it 's ok to vote for a man who starts an unjustified war that results in the deaths of hundreds of thousands ... right ?
And who is it @ 1790 that said the right of the people to bear arms ONLY related to active duty militia members ? It makes little sense to argure ambiguity and precision at the same time , but that is what Cornell does . His argument is internally inconsistent in that in an effort to undermine the standard model , he argues that there was no agreement on what the RKBA meant , but then he proposes a narrow/exclusive right which would reguire more , not less , precision -though he can not cite even one person from that time articulating such a narrow right . Why would one assume that the civics rights model , which demands exclusivity , is to be favored over the standard model which does not ? Note that the standard model encompasses a right to keep and bear arms for one 's own defense as well as to contribute to the common defense so is consistent with various statements from that time ( i.e . see Bryan 's non-exhaustive list of citations from that era ) . However the civic rights model proposed by Cornell does not fit with what was said by J.Wilson , R , Sherman , and other framers .
I think this is a fair conclusion . I went as far as I did because of what it seems to say about the governor calling for a joint session . I may be wrong , but the text seems to instruct the governor to keep them in joint session until final action is taken . In other words , it does n't appear that the governor has an option . And it does not seem that the Constitution allows for a legislative session that never ends . I 'm not sure how else to square the two except that the legislature should pursue final action . Of course , as you have pointed out , it really is hard to speculate on this one without any historical context of the amended Amendment Process , and/or the relevant legal precedent surrounding it . Any thoughts on this ?
wow ... you are bent on harping on creationists arguments at whatever the cost . first of all , you are not even considering that the majority of people are misinformed of what evolution is not because they have creationist motives , but because they go to the dictionary for definitions
What I 've been saying here , and after awhile - the guilt , depression , etc - will get buried , deeper & amp ; deeper - but no negative/damaging experiences leave people . They stay quietly in the background-computer base - until , as you said : Hopefully , the person `` finds some way of forgiving themselves '' , right . But what about in the mean-time ? - And we know , from research & amp ; quite a number of Healers , that rot ( inside a person ) is damaging ... and often in very unsuspecting ways . Much better to life benevolently , in the first place . Annie

OS is so consumed with vitriolic hatred of me he is incapable of realizing that I did not start this thread . The fellow who started it has been banned for his extreme anti-woman views . Perhaps OS should be banned for his extreme anti-Simone views .
To point our an error , i believe the baby was at the infant stage , not the toddler .
The short answer is that it is n't . See the details here : Phil Plait
I find it difficult to believe that one would be banned from this site simply for not learning about evolution . There must be something else involved here . Either someone is joking with you about having you banned or you 're not telling us the whole story . Now if there 's a move to ban you for incessant challenges of things that have been clearly explained over and over and over , there may be grounds for extraction . I 'd like to read the whole story . Will the real moderator please stand up ?
So you see a cop on the streets , you see he 's armed , that 's enough to induce aggression and violence , possibly cause you to hurt others , simply because you saw that somebody else was armed ?
I 'm glad that you qualified your answer with `` fairly '' . It certainly is n't normal to consider an infant NOT a person .
Well , it seems to me that if you have a reflex it means you have an at least partially developed and functional nervous system which would tell me that you can feel pain .
yea , above the species level at least sounds plausible .
Did you happen to notice this on the side ?
Really ? Wow , I didnt know that books with their edjumacational benefits ...
Actually , that 's your job , since it 's already generally assumed that guns do n't fuel aggression . You 're the one who brought that point up , it 's your job . You need unquestionable proof that the mere presence of a gun fuels aggression , and so far , none has been presented to me .
Well , this gets rather complicated . A very young child does not get to choose his or her adoptive parents . Who decides on who adopts whom depends on the kind of adoption and the policies of the particular adoption system . In private domestic adoption , the birth mother usually gets to decide on who will adopt her baby . The foster care system is organized differently , and international adoption is different still and depends on the country from which the child is being adopted . So it 's pretty much impossible to generalize about adoption policies and practices . They vary greatly . The point is that the purpose of adoption is to protect the rights of the child .
You mean like this ? Pleistocene or Ice Age mammals , such as mammoths and musk oxen , had been found in Lake Bonneville deposits along the Wasatch Front as early as the 1870s . The Salt Lake Tribune noted a musk ox skull found near downtown Salt Lake City in 1871 . Pleistocene fossils , including invertebrates , fish , and birds , as well as the large extinct mammals , continue to be found in Pleistocene deposits throughout Utah.Utah History Encyclopedia And evidence similar to this has been found all over the world . But you ignore it or interpret it to fit your agenda . This Why ? And who cares what YOU would expect to find when we are speaking about what happened in reality ? It 's all a matter of interpreting the same available info and we interpret it very differently . But only in your mind does that make your interpretation correct and ours wrong .

Worthless quote . Creationists are known for grossly quoting out of context , as well as relying on outdated sources , and , the Creationist does n't even give a source in order to anyone to check up on his quote . Here 's a Creationist-style quote for him : the Bible says , `` There is no god '' .
So how do you propose that communication in one instance over a network differs from communication over a network in the other . If for example I tell you that there exists a network and that communication takes place over it can you tell me if that indicates intelligence or not ? And how do you propose to PROVE that only living things CAN be intelligent ? What evidence would suffice ? Clearly according to you communication over a network is NOT sufficient proof ! What you have in fact done is to claim that all living things are intelligent and that communication is not evidence of that intelligence . So if communication is not adequate to demonstrate intelligence what criterion do you use ? Frankly I think you have no criterion in mind other than a system being what you call alive - itself a vague and difficult to pin down category ! Are viruses intelligent or not ?
No it 's not . Perhaps because you do n't understand much about evolutionary theory you have confused it with ID . ID is not science and has no evidence to support it .
So who 's the head honcho ? It 's not like all these professional scientists all see eye to eye . There are even scientists that hold to theistic evolution .
Because Humphreys went out looking ? How many should we allegedly find ?
Just how many gun clubs do you think there are in this area ? If a thief plans to steal guns , it is therefore logical for them to choose members of a Gun Club , and follow them home ! What do you expect the criminals to do ? Go to a anti-gun rally and follow the Antis home ?
Well either the police are going by documented reports , or they 're just making up a BS number to give politicians something to bite on for furthering their agenda .
very smart answer . I never knew men couldnt get pregnant . lol , you just made yourself look like an XXXXX with that statement . by the way , i was referring to those issues are pretty much symptoms of obesity . But the thing is ... obesity isnt natural , the process of pregnancy is totally natural .
Oh yeah , ... and that lady `` Michael Jackson ! ''

Besides being terribly wrong , that 's not evolution and has nothing to do with evolution . Perhaps because you know so little about orbital physics you think that the sun rising and setting is any kind of evidence for the earth orbiting the sun . It is n't . You would have to actually understand a little about it to know that . Nobody , from Copernicus onward , used observations of the revolution of the earth to conclude that the earth was in orbit around the sun .
interestingly , single-celled organisms and `` simple organisms '' ( those with less functionality ) look more alike than they do to mammals and other more `` complex '' organisms ...
Wow , I think this is the first time I 've ever heard anyone claim that the pro-choice movement is for the sake of the child . Sorry , you are n't even close . I do n't know a pro-choicer period that would say it 's for anything other than the sake of the woman .
We ca n't pick both ? Why the hell not ? Phenotypic plasticity is not an unknown phenomenon or fringe belief . You are presenting a false dichotomy . Plasticity arose via `` Darwinian '' evolution , not instead of it . To clarify : we do not claim that life evolved via Lamarckian mechanisms , but we do n't deny that plasticity is real . What we reject is that that plasticity is the driving force of change .
This whole riff where people talk about preventing employers from firing gays JUST cause they are gay as a `` special right '' is something that seems to fool those who are prejudiced against gays ... ... but for most people , they recognize it as a propagandic phrasing with little merit . I think our laws should include something that prevents people from firing employees based on the employee 's sexual orientation . But to utilize your phrasing Archie , do you think that religion is something that deserves `` special rights '' ?
You forgot to fully quote John 8:18. here is the rest : and the Father that sent Me beareth witness of Me . He is n't bearing witness to Himself here . Two witnesses are , one of which is Himself , which is why He said in John 8:17 It is also written in your law , that the testimony of two men is true . John 5:30-32 is saying this exact same thing .
In principle , there is no difference between the two as the result is the same , a dead baby .

That logic can be applied to weeds or trees . Anything that is non-sentient , or non-mental existant . Should we make gardening illegal too ? The thing is , you have no base for calling it a human being or giving it the same rights as us . Human beings are , by nature , sentient . That is what makes us different from wildlife . When that only difference is separated , then it should not share the same rights as you or me . An accurate analogy would be someone who 's brain was ripped out and was kept on life support . It would only be a body , no person inside of it . Same goes with an embryo . It simply can not override the rights of its host .

Required medical procedures should make anyone with even a breath of freedom left become ill . If you have any familiarity with typical legislative processes you 're aware the formula is getting the first half passed and required viewing can be tacked onto a peanut museum funding bill . http : //www.grtl.org/printerfriendly.asp ? aaid=78 ~Full Disclosure Ultrasound Act  Representative James Mills introduced HB 888 Full Disclosure Ultrasound Act to require an ultrasound or sonogram examination of each unborn child before an abortion is performed or a referral for an abortion is made . All facilities where abortions are performed and all facilities of physicians who refer for abortions will be required to have functional ultrasound or sonogram equipment on site or have access to the equipment through other medical facilities . As part of the informed consent to abortion , a pregnant female desiring an abortion will be offered an opportunity to view the ultrasound or sonogram image of her unborn child . This will be a top priority for GRTL in 2006.~ I lived in Georgia and it 's not beyond my comprehension legislators would propose legislation requiring medical procedures not applicable to women without the intent of abortion . It has n't been that many years since they considered skin color other than white as a lesser race and used state legislation to segregate all non-whites . It was difficult to believe I was in the US while experiencing Georgia 's segregation policies in the 1960s .
Can you please provide a cite in the Constitution that supports the notion that a Supreme Court Justice nominee has the power to declare that any case is `` settled law '' and the subsequent power to make it so ? I did n't think so .
But evolutionary theory does n't claim that species arise in a single generation . How does it make your point to argue against claims that evolutionary biologists do n't make ? In fact , is it honest to misrepresent evolutionary theory ?
This is a toughie . Let me think about it and I 'll get back to you ...
Actually , the majority of my first post in this thread came from Robert H. Churchill 's article who is an advocate of the individual rights interpretation .
So you do n't have a problem with turning real graduate degrees into degrees on par with diploma mills ?
Just look at the dates on your sources : 1969 , 1978 , 1981 , 1977 , 1980 , 1981 , 1981 , 1983 , 1970 . Your most recent source is 25 years old and that one is from a creationist source . You 've got to be kidding me . I also notice that you claim to have had a private conversation with Andrew Ingersol in which you pointed out an error that he had made . I suspect that you are a liar or a thief . But of course ! You are a creationist ! I also notice that you do n't seem to have made an attempt to educate yourself by checking out the sources I gave you . Moreover , you still have n't presented any evidence for creation . You keep claiming that there is some . Why do you refuse to present it ?
And the fact that you ca n't understand why it was rejected is whose fault ?
Really ?
Then find him voicing his support for DC 's unconstitutional gun control laws , and his claim that they should 've been allowed to remain on the books .
Actually , you gave ( and misspelled ) one of the common names given to the fossil , `` Turkana Boy '' It is also sometimes called `` Nariokotome Boy '' . But the real designation of the fossil is KNM-WT 15000 and any knowledgeable discussion of that fossil will refer to it as such . That fact , by the way , is how I know that Turkana Boy and Nariokotome Boy are one and the same fossil .
So what ? The fact remains that Britain is still four times as dangerous as America in terms in crime rates . Or are you arguing that their crime level is acceptable and that you 're alright with so many more people being a helpless victim unable to do anything ?
That 's not a faithful devotion , it 's a logical conclusion .
And that 's almost certainly how things were at least once in the past : several hominid species migrating , competing , evolving - we 're the descendants of the ones that won . That 's what you fail to appreciate by continuing to insist that 'science says ' fossil hominids are our ancestors . Science says no such thing . Science says this was Planet of the Apes - and we won . Why are there still chimps , then ? Because they were n't competing with us . Think : the same ecological reasons why chimps could n't evolve our level of intelligence made it not worth our while to fight them for that territory . Does n't that make beautiful , perfect sense ? Only since we 've started exporting our ecology , cutting down jungles and so on - only since then have we come into competition with them , to their cost . If we 're not careful , the answer to the fatuous question `` If we evolved from chimps , why are there still chimps '' will be `` there are n't '' . It 's silly to attach significance to the fact we 're the 'only ' intelligent species . For a start , we 're not the 'only ' - we 're the first . Intelligence - our 'level ' of it - was never inevitable ; it 's not some ultimate goal , any more than swimming or flying . But assuming it happens , someone has to be first , and we 're it . Secondly , we 're not the 'only ' - we 're the most . So far . And we 're getting smarter - so do n't be so quick to declare us the pinnacle ; you have no idea what peaks are hidden in the clouds ahead . If we 're lucky , in a million years the smartest creature will be one of our descendants , but it could just as easily be whatever creature emerges to claim the territory we leave behind when we become extinct . THREAD REVIEW
Yes I exaggerate . As long a Americans who love freedom and have the means to protect it , you will never see the same oppressive taxation in Europe happen here . If Bellesiles is the poster boy for academia and socialism , then I rather not have utopia run by men like him .
So scientists are doing science , lots of it . Check the August 2007 issue of Evolution , for example . On the other hand IDists produce nothing , do no lab work , but just harp and harangue against evolution . As the article says , `` Its passionate diatribes virtually advertise the program they attack . People must fight for something that they want to achieve , not simply reject an evil , however bad it may be. Shoe fits you lot , WW , not us .
well , in order to give you have to have first . how can you help the poor if we are all poor ?
Consciousness is created ( in my view ) by the brain - but I guess it could be described as non-material in the sense that the certainty of its detection is a subjective event . I know that the activity of brain `` waves '' can be monitored , but the stream of consciousness that they give rise to is entirely interior to the mental environment .
No Matt , that 's not what I 'm saying at all . The truths and principles in the OT still stand up today and always will . Some of the customs and traditions of that period no longer apply but the OT never promoted those customs and traditions as eternal standards to live by .
Actually I have read the entire Bible and it never mentioned Harry Potter - even once . People who do n't see Harry Potter are SILLY ! Especially since this latest one is awesome . Very funny . Harry Potter is about witchcraft like Star Wars is about NASA . This is the same silly as those who fretted over the DaVinci Code . It 's FICTION . By the way you spelled `` jerks '' wrong .
And why do you suppose they are n't ? Could it be that such an occurrence is exceptionally rare ?
Eternal damnation is the punishment of sin .
You show a gap to be inexplicable via natural forces by trying to explain it via natural forces . You ca n't do it by hypothesising supernatural forces , because that 's just meaningless unfalsifiable speculation . ID does n't have a different method of searching - all it does is give up quicker . That 's how it 'detected design ' in the eye ; that 's how it 'detected design ' in blood clotting , the immune system - it just gave up looking for natural explanations and assumed design filled the gap .
No but his complete dependence on a media machine certainly takes away from the validity of his message . The models for climate change that Gore recites are strictly weather and do not look at global climate patterns and do not look at climate changes within history . The changes that are occuring now are within the limits of changes that have happened elsewhere in history . His information is just a `` part '' of the story . That is why he is incorrect .
I do n't know if you ever heard of the UK Poll Tax but I could have seen myself protesting by non-payment against such a grotesquely unfair system of taxation had I been of the age to do so .
Your reason for believing this lies entirely within the Bible . I hardly consider a 1500 year old book `` making clear what he wants '' . Particularly given that even among those who believe the book , they still ca n't agree on what God wants . And of course , that does n't even beging to address the issue of all the other holy books which contradict the Christian Bible . You may personally believe that you know what God wants , but if so it 's not because God has been clear about it .
You may have missed the context from the other thread I referred to . The point I made is that the unlikeliness of a Presidential signature did not stop Senator Obama from voting in favor of a required Iraq troop withdraw timetable . The promised veto threat did n't matter in this instance . He was `` standing on principle . '' Well , same would apply for his newfound views disfavoring DOMA as well in my view .
Huh ? I 'd love to live in a world where abortions were never necessary , that does n't mean I think it 's a bad thing . And what is this `` higher view of life '' ? A blade of grass is a life but I do n't see anyone charging out to save it . What you actually mean is `` higher view of fetus ' ''
If they 're voting then they should be paying taxes too . There 's no excuse for those lazy stiffs to avoid being miserable along with everybody else . Nobody ever said that taxes had to stop just because you do .
Of course . The makers of Expelled were within their right to expel the very same people that they were attempting to demean in the film . It 's perfectly legal , but it was also a rude , hypocritical , and stupid PR move that is rightfully being criticized .
Oh well . Life goes on .
... .says the one making stuff up . Creation is so wrong on so many levels it boggles the mind how people can take it seirously . Write anything vague enough and it can mean anything , as you just showed . Alright , let 's start making up scriptures and analyzing them to mean anything we want them to be . `` In the new age , on a series of fourths , on the new line of speech , the hindered will rise aganist the scholars '' obviously this means that milo , who is hindered is challenging those who actually study and know facts . hahahaha
And I believe they should ban religious speech the defame gays or ban religion all together as a public nuisance and protect the public from its drug like effects . I understand , however , that to restrict others freedom of speech of one group today , might mean that my freedom of speech could be restricted tomorrow . They have the right to free speech even free speech , I or anyone else diagrees with . This does not mean that I think that they do not have to take responsiblity for the speech . With freedom comes responsiblity . The law suit for pain and suffering , I think is just . Oh so many law suits to plan . Because with freedom of religion and religious speech comes responsiblity . This case now sets Precedent , that if I find religious speech hurtfull , or the actions of religious groups trying to fight gay people , marriage , or gay rights , I could sue for pain and suffering . God bless Fred Phelps for giving fundies and religion a black eye . Fred Phelps is the one of the best things ever that could happen for gay rights . GO FRED .
So increased levels of testosterone cause agressiveness in women ? Androgen causes aggressive behavior in females ? You know this crud is ridiculous and long refuted . Wan na go around again like Bellesiles , who by the way is now admitting it was a wrong , fake story and lays the blame on the student who told him the story . If he ca n't get reality right in current events , just how accurate do you think he is in history ? Yuk , yuk , yuk . Just a portent of how skewed his upcoming book will be with all his bias and semi-literate `` facts '' . I will keep my money in my pocket and fold it to double it Why do you always play water and seek the lowest levels ?
You ask to debate a lot of issues at once . Do you believe in a literal Adam ? Do you not think that the idea is completely connected to Jesus ' ministry ? If it were n't for sin - Jesus would need not have come .
The KKK use of firearms is n't a legal and lawful use , as dictated in the Heller ruling . Next argument please !
Somethings words ca n't capture
Idealy this MIGHT not be a bad solution ... however , the risks to everyone else and the pain it would cause the rest of society would probably be greater .
I learned a few things from the post . The author claimed `` most households dont have guns '' . According to 1997 stats , 25 % of ALL US adults owned firearms . If you assume that there are typically two adults per household , that means 50 % of households have guns , so the statement is false . On a personal note , someone tried to break into my brother 's apartment shortly after he was married . He quickly opened the door , yelled `` freeze MFer or I 'll blow your head off ! '' while holding a short-barrelled shotgun and watched the perp # # # # himself . being half asleep and in possession of a slightly modified shotgun , my brother did n't call the cops to report this self-defensive use of a firearm .
Oh , I do n't know ... he could be on to something . Of course , applying his and Kurtz 's logic to other situations could explain some other modern day mysteries . For example : From Colson 's article : For thirty years I have been going into prisons across America . It has been a wonderful opportunity to share Christ , but it has also been depressing to watch the prison population explode at the same time : When I left prison thirty years ago , there were 239,000 inmatesnow there are 2.3 million in America.Clearly , his 30 years of visiting prisons has caused the explosion in the prison population . Maybe is was all the Bible thumping ... Ahem .
Honey ! ! ! What do you think I was hinting at ? ? ? ? Hmmm ... wonder if I could get my partner to actually step onto a plane ... Hey , has TF Green changed all that much in the past fifteen years ? At least I 've got some friends I could stay with ! ! ! ( and no ... I do n't mean you ... remember I used to live in RI )
No . It does n't refer to `` advances '' of life over time at all . It refers to changes of life over time . To call any of those changes `` advances '' is subjective .
How does being poor limit your responsibility to protect yourself ? I know a poor woman who has 10 kids just hoping that one day she would find a man that would be willing to help raise the rest . Also , what do you mean by `` less fortunate ? It never happened but she kept having kid after kid and hoping it would . Should she be excused for her behavior because she is poor ? No , she kept going to BARS looking for good men . Bad choices = bad outcome . Do you think that this is proof that abortion is necessary ? Nope , abortion IS NOT the answer in cases like this , only responsibility can solve the problem . The bad thing is that only one of the men do anything for the children and he does n't do enough . She has never filed for child support and the kids are almost never disciplined .
Responding to the question in the topic , I tend to use the case of Baby Fae . Freethoughtradio also has short blurbs called `` What 's the Harm ? '' that gives some examples of `` the natural harm caused by supernatural belief . ''
Really ? Liver , kidney , prostate , uterus , pancreas ? Can you please support that for me ? The rest of your post is sheer , meaningless stupidity . Only XXXXXX and creationists claim that evolution implies some sort of `` step up . '' The reason is the neither is capable of understanding the basics . Do you actually think that the pile of XXXX that you posted has anything to do with evolutionary theory ? Perhaps if you had the integrity to actually learn the basics of what you claim to oppose you would not make yourself look so foolish . It is pathetic .
I was about to take a sip of coffee when I read that ! Would have lost the keyboard and monitor ! ! !
So why do some feel it necessary to deceive in order to `` put a lump in the throat '' of the American People ?
Part of his personality
It did n't say ~some~ supernatural entities , did it ? Do you think it would be a valuable addition to every school library ? Would that be constitutional ?
That 's certainly your right , but supersport is interested in hawking a religious agenda , not a scientific one . He may want it disguised as a scientific one , but a perusal of his posts here bely that desire .
You forgot the evolution of the motorcar , the evolution of Christianity , the evolution of the computer , the evolution of the trumpet , the evolution of ... The word evolution is used in everyday terms to mean change ( normally for the better ) . Biological evolution , ie the theory of evolution , is unrelated to this everyday use of the term . `` Astronomical evolution '' , just like `` Trumpet evolution '' has nothing to do with the theory of evolution . When you grasp this simple concept , you will have made your first step toward becoming knowledgable about the theory . At the moment , you are stuck on the start line boasting about the end of the race : you are a YEC supporter in other words .
Actually , a few studies I 've seen suggest exactly that . Looking at the birth rates among the various ethnic groups , and correcting for better birth control , etc , the rate actually remained fairly constant from before the Roe v Wade decision to the years afterwards . This suggests that the number of abortions remained fairly constant , they simply became legal to perform and recieve . My feeling is , the desire and need for the abortion option has always been there . The legality will affect it , but not to a great extent .
Ah , see , that 's the thing . I think about it enough to understand it . Clearly , you do n't . You do n't understand a damn thing .
I think that you should check with cosmologists , astrophysicists , astronomers and the like to see why most scientists accept the findings of those sciences , even evolutionists . I suggest you read some books . The Whole Shebang : A State-of-the-Universe ( s ) Report by Timothy Ferris , emeritus professsor at UC Berkeley . A really good writer , Ferris has taught courses in journalism and science writing , as well as english , philosophy , and astronomy - a total of 5 diciplines at 4 universities . Other books that may help you to understand the topic are : Wrinkles in Time by George Smoot and Keay Davidson . The book is a report on the COBE experiments that verified the predicted unevenness of the background radiation . A good explanation of cosmology in general . The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos by Brian Greene . These books require some scientific savy , so they may be a bit too difficult for you .
And think of what other animals have built ( and for an actual purpose ) . Take a look at a bee hive . It 's so complex and so perfect for them . They built that . An ant hill is at least 20 times the size of an ant . That 's 120 feet for us ( for a 6 foot person ) .
Then I would consider living in a different neighborhood , because if that many kids are getting shot , they are gang members , because outside of gang members , according to statistics , it does not happen that often , and certainly not in one area . As far as why I was looking down the barrell of an assault rifle , it was the result of road rage .
The definition of `` person '' is a living human . obviously the fetus is living , so it is a human . www.dictionary.com
Oh , really ? Translation : the only amendments that rise and fall are the ones that I want to .
So , when you talk about the chemical ingredients are you talking about compounds or elements ? If you are talking about compounds Peeling 's point is valid . If you are talking about elements you answer your own question .
Well , yeah , if science has n't provided an explanation for a phenomenon , then all we can do is shrug and submit grant proposals .
More propaganda ! Analysys my thoin ! its propagandist opinionary `` The news does reach the press -- including WorldNetDaily , which gives it a particularly ... ah ... .. WorldnetDaily spin . ( WND , out of California , still believes Ken Starr is part of the Vince Foster cover-up ) . '' ^^^Ad Hominen ? They hold a certain opinion on something completley unrelated to prove that WND does not know what its talking about ... . Nothing to back this claim up , nor any attempt to show contradicting data . They mysteriously have data from a website from what I could tell was last updated in 1996 that does not even ASK THE QUESTION ABOUT USE OF GUNS IN CRIME ! Pitiful .
JUST A THEORY do u even know what a theory even is ? You are just using the same strawman argument . U seem to know very little about science . THere have been many transitional fossils . you just seem to ignore facts after fact . You say we cant prove evolution nor produce any kind of evidence for transtional fossils yet you just accept God created everything without proving that to be true yourself . I may not have a brain but you just prove that people without brains may be smarter than some people who do have brains .
How many people were killed last year in the U.S. by all those combined ?
Where am I getting with this ? The bill that would allow the Attorney General to deny a firearms purchase to anyone and everyone if their name is on the secret suspected terrorist watch list . The list with an unknown criteria for getting on , no disclosure so you know even if you are on it , and absolutely no way to get off of it . And what are these mayors saying ? That a person who gets denied a firearms purchase -because their name is on this secret list and the AG has the power and authority to deny you said purchase- needs to be prosecuted as if they 're a criminal .
I 'm not sure what your point is . You mistake rodensia for piltdown . You cite Woodward , a known fraud . None of this is represented in the theory .
But do you have any proof at all ? What is the basis of their beliefs in God , Jesus etc . without use of the Bible ? What source ( besides themselves ) do they have to determine who God / Jesus are without the Bible ?
A rock may be useful for shattering a window , but shattering a window is not a rock 's purpose ( unless you subscribe to some strange deterministic philosophy ) .
There is a massive amount of evidence that points to things being designed via evolution rather than a concious designer - there are massive amount of badly designed organs and organisms , either God is spiteful or incompetant . Lets not go into the parasitic wasps and hyperparasitic wasps which are what made Darwin convert ( or part of it ) . He could n't beleive that a kind benevolent creator would design such horrors intentionally . Having something 's larvae consume your organs whilst still alive and feeding of another catapilar 's guts whilst still inside them strikes you as a kind and good thing to do ?
Because each generation can get taller or shorter ? How many generations is it from the flood till David ?
While that may be true of life in general , all it really logically entails is that SOME  not all  organisms throughout all of lifes history were able to reproduce . And at a smaller scale , it does not apply to any individual organism : it doesnt tell us that in order for organism X to be considered living that it must reproduce ( take for example , mules ) . Must All Living Organisms Die ? An implicit assumption in the last several arguments is that all living things must die . After all , if a living organism didnt die , then it wouldnt need to reproduce in order to persist , even for 4 billion years . We need to ask , Does this assumption of universal death hold ?  Yes , well , at least for all instances of life that we currently know of . Thus , it is a conclusion based on induction , not on necessity . Consider a species capable of repairing itself indefinitely . Sound far fetched ? Well , we humans ourselves are desiring to do just that . And to an extremely limited degree , we have succeeded . Of course , we still have an enormous distance left before fully succeeding , but if we were to eventually do so , then could it really be said that reproduction is a requirement to consider humans as being alive ? No . Wed be like immortal mules : wed be alive , yet incapable of reproducing but unlike mules , we wouldnt need to be continually replaced by reproduction . After all , we could stop reproducing ( women might really like that idea ! ) and instead focus on repairing those that currently exist . Perhaps , though , we immortal mules , by simply repairing ourselves and maintaining the status quo , would still somehow die : after all , nature shows us that those organisms that dont adapt to the ever changing conditions on Earth just dont last . Perhaps the changes in our environment would be too dramatic to be handled by simply replacing what is damaged with a new part . This line of reasoning fails since our intent is not simply to repair ourselves , but to improve ourselves as well . Humans intend to direct their own bodily evolution , either via installed hardware or through genetic manipulations , adapting our bodies to changes in the environment . And if we ever reach this ultimate goal ( is it a good goal ? ! ) , then we could save energy by modifying our bodies to eliminate the no-longer-required processes involved in reproduction . Conclusion Based on the above lines of reason , I assert that reproduction is not an absolute requirement of life : that something could be considered to be alive without it necessarily needing to be able to reproduce .
The frequency of legitimate ones does n't warrant my walking around armed all the time IMO . How does my being unarmed put you at risk ? Think I should be prepared to shoot someone for you in case of emergency ? Touchee yourself .
Evolution is all about godlessness , yet its not atheistic . I see . ID gives up looking for natural explanations , evolution gives up looking for supernatural ones . ID hypothesizes supernatural , evolution hypothesizes natural origins .
How do you know square circles do not exist ? Modern man could 've named a square circle something different than it is . Ancient man could 've called an object a square circle . For a question like that , you would have to search the universe to be 100 % sure square circles do not exist .
Oh wait , I have ... I was a creationist for 18 years of my life . 10 of which I was coherent enough to understand some aspects of science and about 5 of which I understood the more complex ones . I know all the Creationist arguments , I have used them . And I used to be a darn good creationist debater ... I could almost convince atheists who just did n't understand enough science to refute me . I had learned evolution in high school . I could repeat the facts , but I did n't believe them . I never argued with high school biology teachers becasue they did n't know enough about it to argue back . Then cam college . I took a course in evolution , because I am a curious and open-minded person . I went to class I took the notes and I talked to my prof. during his office hours . For each of the proofs he gave me , I gave him reasons ( creationist arguments ) that they were n't proof or that they were wrong , and he was able to easily refute any argument I gave him . I always questioned him and refuted things in the book , but he always refuted mine right back , and he did a better job and used undeniable empirical evidence . ( No I am not going to give you any here I have neither the time nor the degree ) At this point I was a very confused Christian , I talked to other Christians , I found sites online and then I found a creationist debate site . I asked what they thought and after hearing points from all sides : atheist , hard-core creationist , theistic evolution , self-righteous butt heads . I came to my own conclusion with all the facts that I had . Since then I have seen Kent Hovind speak ... and I uh ... wo n't go there . The fact of the matter is ... can my belief in an old evolved earth withstand creationist arguments ... I would say so . Have I taken classes in Creation ... heck yeah . Will I take more in the future ... sure if I think they have anything to add to my knowledge . In fact there is a professor at my college who is a creationist and if he ever speaks I will certainly go to hear him . So am I close minded or afraid to learn something new or change my opinion ... no . I look to find the truth through facts and knowledge . Because after all when you find truth you find God . So instead of attempting to turn my question back to me , why do n't you actually ask yourself ... are you afraid to take a detailed class in evolution taught by someone with a PhD ... could Creationism stand up to it . I ca n't answer that question for you , and I ca n't even tell you whether you should try to find the answer or not , it 's your choice . But do n't forget , whenever you believe something do n't just belive it because someone said so , find out WHY you believe it to make sure that you should
Ouch ! And we 're one of your best allies ! You know that really hurts . Maybe that `` We 're American , screw the world '' attitude is why you 're getting planes hurled at you . And we 're one of your best allies and you do n't care about us ? But , yes , one is too many . A nut case who is so freaked out that he thinks his own government is out to steal everything he has , is one too many . The good thing though , is you 've now painted yourself into a corner . You say no one cares about me because I 'm from Australia . So , if you reply to this , it means you do care . And if you do n't then as far as we 're concerned , I 've had the last word . Thank you .
Kellermann , in one of his studies , compared criminal homicides to legally justifiable homicides . He compared homicides to homicides ( FBI data does the same ) which seems more fair than your comparison- comparing only gun homicides to all types of crime supposedly prevented by crime according to one very controversial study . And I never said the war on drugs was a mistake .

I have clashed horns with SilentPoet before . He is , unfortunately , neither a poet , nor more tragically , silent . This is indeed a debate forum , and I do n't see why a self-confessed atheist would want to discontinue his attacks on religion and feign real concern for people 's opinions . If you have some proof of his change of heart , please let me know how you know this . Otherwise , I continue with my warning , which is also my right to give , and yours to ignore , or to respond to as you have .
That distinction may be irrelevant since they do say that no god that any religious person believes in exists . And that is what I was getting at originaly . Still I think that the idea that the existence of all religious gods can be ultimately refuted based on the logic you bring up is invalid .
404 . Please post relevant , unbroken links . As for butterflies , the full grown , living ones can probably breed , but the others ca n't .
Oh . I got the impression that you were an anti . Nevermind .
** You can 'describe ' materialism in ways that are untrue , but that wo n't make change the reality of the case . What materialism has done , under a long series of name changes , [ the last being 'naturalism ' , if I 'm not mistaken ] , has been to desperately rationalize the evidence of actual reality in the form of 'forces ' and other phenomena antithetical to its principles and assumptions by pretending that what it says is n't what it means . For example that its denial of all things immaterial and incorporeal and insubstantial does n't apply to forces , mass , energy , and so on . All very darwinian SOP .
It 's sad when the fate of the Earth is at stake and all you can do is call someone weird . You should be doing your best to convert everyone you know so I wo n't have to dispose of my project .
I think at least part of the reason is that they do n't wear their sexuality on their shoulder and flaunt it . And they do n't seem to live for the purpose of 'gay pride . '
And we see that all over the world , yet you will explain it away once it 's shown to you . Turbidites and Water Sorting There are some other interesting things to note about the geologic column . Many of its layers , wherever they are found in the world , are sorted with the courser material on the bottom and the finer material on the top of that individual layer ( Except in the case of underwater slumps where the material is sorted fine to course ) . 2 Does this sorting make sense to have happened over millions of years ? Sorting like this does not take place today except in specific circumstances . This kind of sorting only occurs naturally in water , and specifically in underwater mudslides called turbidites . I think it is interesting that much of the geologic column looks exactly like turbiditic layering.3 In fact , geologist today no longer accept the long prevailing hypothesis of uniformitarian deposition , but have opted instead for a more `` punctuated '' formation of much of the column . These punctuations are generally felt to be the result of sudden catastrophic events with long intervening periods of relative quietness . The does make some sense in the fact of the fact that turbidites create sedimentary layers almost instantly . However , turbidite flow does not flatten or significantly disrupt lower layers . Thus , any erosion or unevenness in lower layers will be preserved . The fact that the layers are generally flat seems to indicate that they were already very flat before the next turbidite came along.The Geologic Column
More bull XXXX . First , our Creationist seems to forget that many millions of bases in the human genome are nonfunctional . Why would random changes to 3 or 4 of those nucleotides be fatal ? They would n't . Besides , our Creationist is trying to make it seem like all of the millions of mutations he references - which is an invalid number - would occur in a single animal ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ? ! ? ! No , the ~1.5 million nucleotide changes in the human lineage ( half the nucleotide differences between the chimp and human genomes ) would have had about 6 million years to accumulate . Finally , our Creationists seems to be aware of the fact that humans differ among themselves at about 1 out of every 200 base pairs . By his reasoning , should n't we all be dead ?
The first winged animals came from animals that had structures very very nearly identical to wings . The first of those came from animals with structures a bit less like wings , and so forth . There was no 'holy # # # # , dude , where did you get those ? ' moment . It 's as if you 're looking at a chunk of stone , a statue , and a chisel , and saying `` There 's no way one lucky hit with that chisel could produce that statue . '' Ca n't you see how absurd that is ?
Well , evolution by natural selection makes things look as if they were designed for the environment in which they live . I do n't presume to give God instructions on how he should go about His work . I only observe it .
The Simone persona is not capable of serious thought . Let alone debate . Ad homs , personal attack and spin is what it thinks is debate . The exchange here should tell you all you need to know about this persona .
Sorry , I should n't have jumped to that conclusion Sometimes this forum gets the best of me ... sorry again .
From the link :
Yes it does . They have the church organizations . In michigan in 2004 they had petition signing sundays in churches , a state wide organization to put marriage on the ballot . So why not do the same with abortion ? If these nutcases feel so strongly that abortion should be banned and they have made the case , as in the marriage initiatives , that the will of the people should be heard then why not get their butts in gear and put it to a popular vote ? All I have heard from these christianists is that the people should get to vote and that the courts should not over ride the will of the people . If they turly believe that then why not put it on the ballot and let the people be heard ? Could it be that , unlike marriage , the majority of people support a womans right to choose ?
You 're telling us we 're soft on crime ? You 're the one who is portraying the two men who were shot as victims and dismissing their crimes . It 's ironic , those two criminals who cross the border illegally with malevolent intentions , robbed a guys house , and were legally killed are poor , innocent victims , yet this 80 year old man who just tried to defend himself and did n't hurt anybody is a mothertrucking , baby-eating criminal who deserves to be locked up . You have such a distorted view of right and wrong , Brady .
Here is what your link says . It is shocking that we have discovered this SCAM has been going on for decades leading up to the current Cap and Trade Legislation and Treaties which will indebt average americans to paying for a scam to the tune of billions of dollars per year . Again , from your link : Scientific progress depends on accurate and complete data . It also relies on replication . The past couple of days have uncovered some shocking revelations about the baloney practices that pass as sound science about climate change . It was announced Thursday afternoon that computer hackers had obtained 160 megabytes of e-mails from the Climate Research Unit ( CRU ) at the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) in England . Those e-mails involved communication among many scientific researchers and policy advocates with similar ideological positions all across the world . Those purported authorities were brazenly discussing the destruction and hiding of data that did not support global-warming claims . Professor Phil Jones , the head of the Climate Research Unit , and professor Michael E. Mann at Pennsylvania State University , who has been an important scientist in the climate debate , have come under particular scrutiny . Among his e-mails , Mr. Jones talked to Mr. Mann about the `` trick of adding in the real temps to each series ... to hide the decline [ in temperature ] . '' Mr. Mann admitted that he was party to this conversation and lamely explained to the New York Times that `` scientists often used the word 'trick ' to refer to a good way to solve a problem 'and not something secret . ' `` Though the liberal New York newspaper apparently buys this explanation , we have seen no benign explanation that justifies efforts by researchers to skew data on so-called global-warming `` to hide the decline . '' Given the controversies over the accuracy of Mr. Mann 's past research , it is surprising his current explanations are accepted so readily.Here 's more on this travesty : The Global Warming Scam Notice that the IPCC which has been the source for global warming lies which its defenders have been posting here for years has been deep into the scam of misinforming the public . It should also be noted that European stock advisers have called for the selling off of alternative energy stocks in light of these scam revelations .
But does not evolution say that there can be NO difference in kind , simply differences in degree ? Evolution does not allow for something of another `` kind . '' If chimps are of a different kind , as well as humans , then evolution still falls .
Only in your mind .
Thankyou for bringing to my attention that atoms , neutrons and protons are merely scientific assumptions . Now as I gaze at the night sky with all its ' bits and pieces spinning around each other I can sleep happily knowing that our solar system is not part of a housebrick afterall .
I 'm confused . Are you saying photo-sensitive bacteria are n't scientifically possible ? Obviously , they evolved from bacteria without the ability to sense light . The mutation that allows a bacterium to sense light catches on with a generation , and natural selection takes hold . A population of bacteria would of course be better suited than another population if it could sense light . From there , it 's a fairly obvious chain of events : photosensitivity becomes more efficient .
Ice is stilll ice at -30 or -40 . I agree with your point that the earth will not flood , however , your justification is bogus . You also forget that with a temperature increase comes an increase in volume , its not the ice that people are worried about . Furthermore , certain currents are based on regional ocean temperatures and are responsible for the moderate climates in various areas ( Britain for one ) .
Actually , there is a LOT that the pseudo-Christian glosses over so as to still maintain the title of 'Christian ' but the respectability of the secular . If you approach the scriptures as intended and stated , you start to resemble EZ and Arch ( amongst others ) , but , their practices are cultic , seperationistic and exclusive and in the world of science and knowledge ... complete hogwash . Who 'd want to be something so regressive and backwards thinking ? Adopt the ideals and practices of the contemorary man ... and you have something approaching a double bind . Thus , you have to start pruning away cognative disonance conflicts from one side or the other . Usually it 's the system that causes you the most problems in your current life so you prune parts of the bible out you do n't like . In weeding , Jo skips over the parable of the vines . Where some vines that bear no good fruit/ are withered , are removed and replaced with new ones . This is the believer who no longer practices , withering in 'faith ' and being removed from Gods vineyard of believers . And those who convert being added in . John 15 Jo sees the passages that state `` Everything is permissable but not everything is beneficial '' as a carte blanch for being able to do anything and still go to heaven as 'once saved , always saved ' which is ironic as that 's an attitude extremist calvinist take ... it also denies free will . The ability to accept and reject this free gift of grace on a moment to moment basis . The gift is freely given to all but not all accept this gift and those who accept it can lose it . Sure , everythign is permissable simply because you can do everything but , it 's not beneficial . It could hurt you physically or emotionally or even lose you your salvation . Those who believe in once saved , always saved can often get a sense of spiritual pride and conciet . Thinking they can do things since they can justify them to themselves and if they can do that , God 's okay with it . End result is them being Matthew 7:21 The bible does NOT say `` a believer may do anything and still be saved . '' If it does somewhere , maybe Jo can point it out with appropriate scripture . As I states , and as the bible backs up numerous times , the free gift must be ACCEPTED . Think of it like this ; you MUST have the ticket to get into heaven . The only way to get this ticket is for you to get one from the ticket giver . The 'cost ' for this ticket is said to be free . The ticket giver does NOT force you to take the ticket , nor does He slip it into your back pocket while you 're not looking . Simply ASK and your shall RECIEVE . Matt 7:7-12 That 's not to say the apostate message of the pseudo-Christian is n't appealing . It tickles the ears mightily . It even allows one such as myself to enter into the small gate at the end of the narrow path ... you know the one `` But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life , and only a few find it . '' Matthew 7:14 Heck , I 've freely broken EVERY commandment and without repentance . That I did so for mostly noble reasons is beside the point . Would be nice to get an easy out and be treated as those who followed evry rule to a T. @ Matthew S , `` Would you kill or burn your child if they did these things ? what part of unconditional love and love without end do you not understand ? '' The part where my Son turn his back on me , runs far away and came to a bad end out of my sight and control ... all because he exercised his free will to do so . Heck , I 'm personally going through this right now with my eldest . The story of the prodigal son has a meaning to it you know . Turn back and repent before it 's too late . At NO time did the father rush after his errant son nor compel him to return . Heck , the father did n't even know that the son spent all his inheritance and was starving UNTIL he came home . In the end , what I find amazing is why pseudo Christians even hang on to the thin vinear of Christianity ... it 's like walking with a crutch when they know they do n't need it . They 've become so use to being told they have a broken leg , that when they realize they do n't ( or it 's been healed ) that they still cling to it . Some even trade in the crutch for a cane or wheelchair ( alternative religious belief system they take up after realizing the one they were born with is n't for them see also : Pagans who were born and raised Christian ) . Of course , ditching the crutch can have it 's own problems . Some realize they can walk unaided and begin to run ... ignoring walls and cliffs . ( So Atheism is n't for everyone either . ) *shrug*
These types of verses are anthropomorphic in nature , meaning that the writer is attributing human characteristics to God . If you had to tell numerous stories in which God seemed to change His mind , and you had to explain every time that He really did n't change His mind , that He really knew what was going to happen but the appearance is that He DID change His mind , it would get a little cumbersome . It is just a way to describe the events without getting into a theological discussion everytime it happens . Looking into some others . I am not a Biblical prophecy expert , so I do n't know what I can do with that one .
But then , the justification for abortion rests on the right to control one 's own body , not population control .
So you think it is a good idea for public schools to assume the role of parents ? Perhaps you would support a balance then . Given what you say here , you would n't think it a bad idea for the New Hampshire School System to take a field trip to the local Catholic church would you ? You know , so kids can know what resources , agencies , and organizations are available to them in the event that they may need to interact with them in the future . The School Board apparently gets the message , however . According to the article , it has instructed school administrators to investigate the matter , and determine whether disciplinary action is necessary . I would think it is .
It says had formed because the narrative is in the past tense . However , the preceding line says `` I will '' implying he had not made them as of that point .
Yes , absolutely . Under a regime where identification papers must be presented on demand , anyone who for whatever reason does not have those papers on them becomes suspect , liable to be rounded up and imprisoned .
You 're kidding , right ? The deputy was the last documented owner of the seized guns before they were found in possession of the drug cartel . He 's the only one who could 've done something wrong in this situation .
Fast and loose means to do something without fully thinking it through or paying attention to detail . I 'm not trying to label anyone as anything , just pointing out common inconsistencies of logic for people who try and harmonize the real world with the bible .
Come on JP really . So what happens when opportunity is not equal ? What is the point of doing anything to solve a problem if there is a disregard for achieving measurable results . The whole point of creating an equal opportunity is to correct an imbalance . What type of results , if any , would be acceptable ? I did n't say the government is always right or the intended goals are always achieved . That is our fault for putting people in government with the intelligence of carpet and then allowing them to stay .
i didnt make any statements . i asked you to kindly explain the relationship between the existence of god and te existence of logic . you are claiming that logic can only exist because god created logic . please explain
Well , until all those problems above are solved and we live in a utopia we 'll still need gun-control . As long as we live in an imperfect society gun-control is necessary in the interest of public safety . Do n't you keep bringing this subject up again and again ?
Yes , they do . So why should you make the same mistake ? We correct creationists about this mistake all the time on other boards . See talkorigins debate board . That Hi_Its_Me went along with the mistake showed that he was no longer discussing evolution or even science , but arguing atheism vs theism . The reason we do this is because science and evolution are not atheism and scientific theories have boundaries . No scientific theory gives a worldview or an explanation of everything . Even the anticipated `` theory of everything '' combining Relativity and QM wo n't explain everything . Evolution has the boundary of the first life . It assumes that a universe and living organisms exist . Just like Cell Theory assumes the same things . If you want to discuss the origin of the first life , then you have to talk about the various theories within the field of abiogenesis . If you want to talk about the origin of the universe , then you need to discuss the various theories within the field of cosmology .
Certainly not . Why would you make such a remark ? While a mutation that allowed a bacteria to metabolize nylon waste products is most certainly an example of evolution , heart transplants ( artificial or otherwise ) are n't . It is an ignorant assertion to claim that they are .
Well , I 'm not sure if he consumed alcohol or not , but his doctor gave him daily `` vitamin '' shots that contained vitamins as well as amphetamines and maybe other drugs that doctors at the time thought were mentally beneficial . And I 've never heard of him being a vegetarian . I saw some show that talked about his voracious apetite , but I do n't think they mentioned his being a veggie .
Does n't count . Took place in a `` gun free zone '' . By law no guns are allowed there , so by law this incident could n't take place .
So it 's just as we 've said : registration can and does lead to confiscation down the line . And now we have further proof that we 're right about what we say . Government gets the weapon registered , then they can , at any time and for any reason , demand it be surrendered to the authorities or else punishment will be administered .
Almost all did . In fact , probably all that you are aware of did . Even the energy in the steak that you eat came from the sun ultimately . The thing is that evolution seems to have resulted in an organism to take advantage of almost every form of available energy . And what energy is left by `` higher '' animals is used by others - insects , microbes - until there is little usable energy left . That even goes so far that there are some organisms that get their energy from geothermal sources - no light involved .
But then again , I guess it just proves my point . Quod erat demonstrandum .
Yes I do . I wonder if you do . Neandertals are n't claimed to be ancestors of Homo sapiens . They are generally considered to be a separate species descended from a common ancestor . No one except uninformed creationists makes any claim that Neandertals are ancestral to modern humans .
I know that sometimes when a woman is on the pill , and they happen to get pregnant anyways , it will cause you to miscarry ( not always , but sometimes ) . Usually it happens very early in the pregnancy before they realize they are even pregnant . But I do n't know if I would call that abortion as in the way the term is normally used , because the woman is n't terminating the pregnancy on purpose , although miscarriage is called 'spontanious abortion'.. I also remember hearing from a friend of mine , who is Catholic , that in her church any type of birth control is considered wrong.. I 'm not sure on that though , since I 'm not Catholic myself .
See above I guess.And if you read the article ( if ) what about the other half ?
Well , there 's plenty of scientific evidence about fetal development , such that we can confidently say no `` person '' is established up to a certain stage in a pregnancy . I think the decision should be up to the woman , as under U.S. law . Between her and her doctor , whoever else she freely chooses to share with . I think , at some point , in a normally developing pregnancy , a very fuzzy looking line is crossed . But that 's why we have state regulations during the third trimester . IMO , Latin American countries , until this day , are unduly under the influence of the Church , superstition and ignorance .
Oh yeah ? How exactly ? How do your supported policies do anything to prevent criminals from getting guns and killing innocent people ? Can you show examples of how gun registration and buybacks HAVE stopped deaths from occurring ? Do n't you dare claim victory for acts that not only are n't yours , but are n't capable of doing a damn thing !
Thank you .
You ca n't reconize the fairy tale you live in . Evolution has to say it happened so slowly it can never be seen or it could never happen . It can not be observed is the best evidence for it . Long ago and far far away . If astronomers , or geolofist decided the time line was too short evolution is dead . Even science magazine says the age of the earth is decided by committee . Everyone must tell the same fairy tale .
Sigh , we have been through this a million times ... the term is defined , doctors testified to it , so yeah it exits .
Yep , it certainly cann be quite expensive .
But , that 's just the argument Chem99a and I are having in another thread .
Actually it 's funny . Mice deprived of THC ( it naturally occurs in the brain ) are smarter than regular mice , but die much earlier . Not because of cancer , but of `` natural '' causes . It would n't be hugely surprising if THC supplements made you live longer , albeit at a lower level of intelligence , even if the smoking aspect of taking it had negative effects that counterbalanced that .
Except the picture of the human remains are clearly NOT fossilized
So , if they had n't planned for and wanted you , you would be perfectly fine with being dead right now ?
600 ? Oh really ? Looks like the following scriptures are vague enough that they could apply to anything and nothing at the same time . Making vague enough comments can easily look prophetic . The fact that there are n't specifics is a key failure in your argument . If the bible was truly prophetic and scientifically accurate , terms that would easily be seen as represenativive of the natural force would be found everywhere , yet they are not . You are talking a little and making it to be far more then it is . Once again , anything vague enough can be taken for anything in any light under any condition .
Yes , a guarantee that you can see a GP within 3 days ( same day or even a home visit within the hour in an emergency ) would be catastrophic , I can see that . And being seen in ER within 4 hours ( for non-urgent cases ) would be terrible .
Is that why there are tens of thousands of `` Christian '' religions ?
Because they are unable to maintain a pregnancy - money , job and education security , health ( physical , mental and emotional ) .
The argument had NOTHING to do with semantics , so stop twisting it .
American law is based on a U.S. Supreme Court decision known as `` Roe v. Wade '' , decided in the 1973 , and whereupon a woman 's right to choose to based in a Constitutional right to privacy , http : //caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/script ... l=410 & amp ; page=113 There have been some related cases since then , over viewed in this wikipedia link , http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v_wade Roe is settled law , though the next president will have the opportunity to appoint up to 3 new Justices . Therefore , if a conservative like McCain went in , he would most likely appoint judges inclined to overturn Roe -- though overturning cases in such a way goes against the principle of stare decisis in our legal system . But the Republicans do n't care too much about stare decisis if they have political objectives on their minds more . McSame would most like to see Roe overturned , but also power vested in the states more . So what you 'd end up seeing is large swaths of the United States with abortion outlawed , and other areas where it would remain legal ( and we would therefore get all the people coming from their states ) . It would become increasingly difficult for poorer women to have access to abortion services or morning after pills , etc . Make of it what you will . I am hearing that you have improved access to medical care as a result of what 's going on where you are . If I understood correctly . I do n't recall you stating your position on this issue .
** Of course it is my interpretation , or if you prefer , my inference from the evidence ; the evidence being your own words and the tone with which you express them .
I may want to give a quick reminder that the bible was written by human beings , not a supernatural entity or Jesus . It is very unlikely that Jesus or God had anything to do with the bible , since the bible is not a very righteous , and preaches much hate . People who truely believe in doing good in the world and being followers of God would not even glance at this 2000 year old abomination .
What for ?
And like the `` chicken and egg '' question , where the answer is `` a bird other than a chicken '' , so the answer to your little riddle is likely to be : RNA .
If a God exists , then God is as God is .
When making that evaluation , one should consider what kinds of evidence it is possible to find in support of or to contradict a hypothesis . Consider the question : `` Are there any car keys in my kitchen ? `` , a question I confess to be dear to my heart at this precise moment . Right now you have no information upon which to base an answer . You should rightly be agnostic . But imagine you came to my house and ransacked the kitchen , turning out every drawer , emptying every cupboard , opening all the packets - even the sealed ones - sieving the flour , looking in all the cups and pots and pans , peering ( though I do n't recommend it ) under the fridge , and still found absolutely no sign of any car keys - would you still consider yourself a car-key-kitchen agnostic ? The moral of the story is that the significance of an absence of evidence very much depends upon how much effort one has expended looking for some . It also depends upon the amount of potential evidence that is n't there . Returning to our original conundrum , there is no conceivable evidence we could ever find that would definitively prove a creator god does not exist , because a creator god , the way we define it , would be eminently capable of concealing his actions . So although there 's no evidence that god does not exist , nor could there be , which rather takes the shine off the observation that there is n't any . On the other hand , we can imagine endless ways in which a god ( faith-specific or otherwise ) could be proved to exist . In biology , we would just need to find one organism with a unique amino acid , or that had something other than the common four nucleotides , or a non-vascular plant with seeds or flowers - the evidence we could find to disprove common descent is limitless . Yet we do n't ; Nature 's kitchen has been forensically inspected for car keys , and they 're nowhere to be found . In geology or astrophysics , we could find consistent evidence of a young earth , yet we do n't . We could verify the efficacy of prayer - yet we do n't . In other words , there 's an absolute mountain of potential evidence to support the existence of a god ( Christian or otherwise ) and none of it 's there , despite us looking really , really hard . As you 've probably guessed by now , I do n't agree that the only rational position is agnosticism .
I think that scientists do n't work with religion and religion has no place in science class .
Because of my rH factor I have had several spontaneous abortions . I have never needed to have an induced abortion . I am very sorry to note that I felt not a whit of regret over my abortions . I had more important things to attend to .
So after he was safe at the hotel , locked in his room , he did not call the police for so many hours because ... ?
Because even if we never know all the details , the theory is sound since ever increasing numbers of observations are consistent with the theory . Not so for Biblical literalist types that are forced to deal with ever increasing refutation of their beliefs .
Just , at the very least , 60 % of American physicians . Then there are all those nurses , radiologists , lab technicians , ambulance drivers , medics , emergency room people , etc etc etc ... Not to mention the majority of the American public .
Canada 's registry has had horrific problems , only registering 3/4ths of their 7 million guns , and has been hacked more times than Lizzie Borden 's parents ! Or George Washington 's Cherry Tree for those who do n't know the tale of Ms. Borden ! Canada Gun owners pressuring Conservatives
Because you are using a word that already has a definition . Main Entry : mar·riage Pronunciation : \ & # 712 ; mer-ij , & # 712 ; ma-rij\ Function : noun Etymology : Middle English mariage , from Anglo-French , from marier to marry Date : 14th century 1 a ( 1 ) : the state of being united to a person of the opposite sex as husband or wife in a consensual and contractual relationship recognized by law Do you see Jews celebrating Christmas ? NO ! They already have a holiday that is defined . And I believe the only reason they added same sex marriage to Webster 's Dictionary is so not to make flamboyant gay men cry . I am not anti-gay , but I am sick of hearing about it . Your rights do not compare to that of a religious background or ethnicity . That 's like comparing an apple to a cardboard box . The only thing the 2 share is the fact that they are nouns . I agree that it should n't be voted on . That 's a waste of my tax dollar . Do you think I ask the government to give me attention because I JUST HAVE to watch Everybody Loves Raymond in hi def ? And you 're in the wrong category if you mention gay rights and civil rights in the same sentence . Civil rights are non political and gays are always protesting something that has to do with the government . I would also like to add that I think it 's tacky that gays ONLY vote for liberals just because they `` love the gays '' . Those people do n't give a # # # # about you . They say that because the Conservatives have n't and intend to get your vote . Voting for one political party over one issue seems morally wrong . You 're gay . Get over it . Move on ... ... ... .
** Hi jo ; Going by your various posts that I 've read , I think that you are probably a person that I could like and whose opinions I could respect . But quite frankly , on the issue of darwinism and the way darwinists play sly games with the English language , corrupting trhe language to suit their ideology , you seem to have been very much duped by their semantic dishonesty . `` Genetic determinism '' and `` neo-darwinism '' are terms that , as a result of constant and perpetual darwinist equivocation are among those that no longer have one , single , and definite meaning among those that employ them . That is , you can never be sure what they mean when darwinists employ them . What do they mean when you use them ? IAC , if 'genetic determinism ' depends upon the linear chemical process of one gene maps to one protein [ it is now known that this is not the case ] , then a 'theory ' of evolution dependent upon phenotypic mutations determined by genotypic mutations is plausible , [ not necessarily true , but plausible ] , even when the genotypic mutations are accidental/undirected/random . But such a `` theory '' , [ that is , a hypothesis whereby the origin/evolution of biological novelty and increased sytematic complexity and productivity is held to be directly and linearly and mechanically and deterministically traceable to accidental genetic alterations ] , becomes entirely implausible when you have `` multi-purpose genes '' , and whole genomes self-organising their own genetic 'pieces ' . Then phenotypic expression is not the sum , or anything like , the deterministic linear outcome of any given mutated gene , or collection of mutated genes , taken together . The entire fisherian notion of `` Random genetic mutation as the source of adaptive phenotypic traits '' goes straight down the tubes , -- just as it always should have done , from day one . But now you are back to where Darwin was , 150 years ago -- he had no explanation for the ORIGINS of species . All he had was a mechanism [ `` NS '' ] for the numerical distribution [ aka 'fitness ' ] of species . That `` theory '' can `` explain '' [ well , not really ] why some species are plentiful , while others are extinct , but it can not and does not explain how they 'evolved ' in the first place . It was because Darwin had this fact rubbed in his face by his contemporaries that he cribbed from Lamarck , and came up with a 'theory ' of origins that he called , 'pangenesis ' . And without `` RM '' , latterday darwinists are in the same position neo-darwinists were in prior to fisherism 's 'modern synthesis ' . They have no mechanism for the origin of traits [ evolution ] , but only one for the preservation and distribution of traits [ inheritance , heretibility , conservation ] . And a very nebulous 'mechanism ' that is , anyway . Now you may be among those who conveniently forget or ignore the fact that `` NS '' does not , and can not , account for evolution , i.e. , the origins of species , but some of us refuse to do that , despite much pressure from darwinists . And we have been `` recalling '' that fact on a regular basis for 150+ years .
True , but then you face problems such as which is better : to live in misery , or not live at all . Certainly it 's better if a woman is able to raise her children in a stable environment and can adequately provide for them , but that seems to be taking a 'social benefits ' angle on that matter . The problem with the social benefits angle is that it changes the question from a question of the mother 's being able to choose to a question of what the mother should choose .
Have ago at believing the irrational , `` the wisdom of the world is completley oppisite to the wisdom of god '' , Its the wisdom of the world that says only the strong survive , but the wisdom of GOD says `` to seek your life you will lose it but to lose it for my sake you will find it ! '' ( The humble are the victors )
Who are you trying to convince , yourself ? Any scientist is well aware of that fact , and if you run into one that states that anything to do with a scientific theory is an ABSOLUTE fact , be VERY wary of what he 's selling . I 'd say your `` victory '' is a pretty hollow one . Waxy
Yes . I already addressed that issue . You embarrass yourself by bringing it up again without actually presenting any arguments against my points . But hey . That 's creationism . Just keep hammering away at the same old stories no matter how many times they are debunked . It 's a bit like Goebbels anthem . Tell a lie often enough and people will begin to believe it .
Fair enough . Guns stolen are n't the majority , opposed to say , strawbuys or illegal sales . That said , this is still scary : USATODAY.com - States with high crime see more guns stolen
I think this is a bad way to put it ... the evidence that they earth has been warming since we have had the ability to measure temperature is overwhelming ... the cause is unknown and whether or not it is natural is unknown . It does seem fairly narasistic to think in 100 years we have caused so much damage to an earth that at least has been here 10,000 years .
`` As President Calderón and I discussed , I am urging the Senate in the United States to ratify an inter-American treaty known as CIFTA to curb small arms trafficking that is a source of so many of the weapons used in this drug war , '' President Obama proclaimed in Mexico City last month . He also incorrectly repeated the errant statistic that 90 percent of guns in the hands of Mexican drug cartels come from America . ( In actuality , according to ATF special agent William Newell , about 17 percent of guns associated with crime in Mexico came from the United States . And this figure has not been broken down to see how many came from civilian gun shops and how many were purchased from the U.S. military by Mexico 's government . ) `` We 're going to be very focused on this . It 's going to be a top priority . '' ABC News quoted an administration official who said that Obama `` felt that it was important to push now for the ratification of this treaty because the question of illegal small-arms is of great concern to the countries throughout the hemisphere a [ s ] it affects their safety. You have the ATFE Assistant Director William Hoover spouting the 90 % figure , Then everyone up and on down jumping on board with it . Then ATF special agent William Newell corrects the figure and goes on to state they do n't know how many came from the private sector and how many came from the US Gov giving them to Mexico . Yet we are supposed to punish the law abiding because other countries either ca n't or wo n't get control of their criminals .
I can see what you are saying . It 's pretty much true ... being a Jewish homosexual , I know it first hand . But just for once , could n't they pick on somebody else ? It seems almost like a bully tactic for the Christian heterosexuals who are against same sex marriages to pick on someone who does n't have a legal leg to stand on ... that 's sad .
Just how are they `` turning gay '' . Is there an epidemic of Spanish people `` turning gay '' .
This coming from the person that makes insane claims without providing evidence . Atleast provide some when asked !
You mean I can get pregnant all by myself ! COOL ! Out with the men . They have been ticking me off for YEARS !
Each side tries to support their own worldview . There are two positions , and sides are chosen . It 's human nature .
Lots of luck on getting any kind of intelligent reply . Have you read the John Woodmorappe book on the ark ?
Well then move out of the rough areas . Stop staying in them like some battered spouse who ca n't seem to break the cycle of abuse and leave their partner . Stop whining about how bad life is because there are guns in America . Imagine how much better if would be if the drug dealers and mass murderers were n't allowed to walk the streets as if they owned them .
And you know what ? No amount of epigenetic change is going to turn a fruitfly embryo into a human . One of the reasons they are different , and subject to different epigenetic regimes , is because despite genetic homologies ( which evolutionary theory predicts ) , their genomes are significantly different . They have some different genes , in different quantities , and in different arrangements , and that is critical . Epigenetics alone ca n't take one species and turn it into another , so far as anyone knows . It takes genomic restructuring , and that happens only through genetic mutation .
So what is your point ? Are you claiming that the tenets of christianity are in doubt because the several thousand denominations hold contradictory views ? Science proceeds by challenges and contradictions . Contradiction in science is not evidence of doubt but evidence of a field of advance . In religion , it is without question , a matter of the veracity of the ultimate truth . Which of the thousands of christian faiths hold the truth ?
Plenty of problems with that `` study '' and parts of it are just hilarious . Number one , socialization plays a huge role in an individual 's reaction to handling weapons . A teen who was raised in a family of outdoorsmen and exposed to firearms in a responsible , constructive fashion would react much differently than a teen who 's only exposure to firearms is his way-cool arsenal in Call of Duty . I think that much the same results could be obtained with exchanging the `` gun '' with a football . Putting a dozen or so 18-22 y.o . in a room with nothing but a football would ensure that an athletic pecking order would be established very quickly . Domineering males would be throwing the football around in a competitive , even punishing fashion , submissive males would be cowering , hoping nobody throws the ball to them . Elevated testosterone levels would be expected in both ; some from competition and some from fight / flight . . . Both groups would exhibit the `` aggressive '' behavior the study offers for diametrically opposite reasons . This effect is compounded because of the anonymity ; the domineering would want to prove manhood and superiority and the submissives would want to inflict revenge , . . . especially if it is on an unsuspecting non-participant . I would go so far as to hypothesize that the submissives would put more hot sauce in the water than the `` aggressive '' domineering subjects . I actually laughed out loud when the overly concerned testers believed they needed to defuse the potentially deadly aggression they caused in the test subjects : `` Because of the potentially arousing nature of the experiment , we wanted to ensure that all subjects were reasonably calm when they left the lab . Therefore , all subjects next watched a relaxing video of nature scenes and classical musical . Given that subjects had been deceived , we next debriefed them , emphasizing that they should not feel badly about any aggressive behavior they exhibited . `` Jezz , thanks for saving us all from wanton pellet gun caused hot sauce attacks !
Do n't you think any gay person posting here already knew that ? Do you think this comes as any surprise ? I mean really ! Kansas ? ? ? ? I also understand Conneticutt is ready to pass legislation approving civil unions for same-sex couples without court intervention .
Actually in Australia it 's der ... people used to say `` Well der Fred '' ( did n't matter if you were called Fred ) . But no , other than that I had nothing to say . Why ? Do you want me to ?
Oh ? And what do you consider yourself when it comes to gun rights ? Are you moderate or fanatical ? Would you actually declare yourself a fanatic or would you like to be known as a moderate ? I do n't think any organization who wants to be taken seriously will declare themselves fanatical about their cause because that would take away from their credibility .
In this case in NYC , the law did exactly what it and most gun laws do best ... PROTECT CRIMINALS . The Sullivan Act was passed for that purpose , to protect union thugs and criminals . How do you imagine laws such as this are `` reasonable '' or protect the innocent , law abiding people if they can ; t defend themselves which is the first law of Nature ! Thanks for the admission that laws such as those do nothing for public safety and are a criminals ' best friend and have no effect on Crime Control nor Criminals but punish and disarm those most needing such tools . Gun control is not crime control as your bunch likes to state . Situations like this are your worst enemy and destroy the lies told by the gun/rights grabbers .
I believe there are a few fish that rely on electro magnetic fields to detect what is around them .
SNIP Stuart Taylor Jr. is NOT on your side . A Right to Keep and Bear Arms ? - The Atlantic ( March 20 , 2007 )
Not by any means . Evolution works on genetic change that future generations will inherit . Adaptation does no such thing . It changes an individual , but not its genes . For example , if my parents volunteered to be part of a scientific experiment where they two additional arms fused onto their body before I was ever conceived , I would not be born with two extra arms . On the other hand , if a genetic mutation made it advantageous to have two additional arms , and both my parents had that mutation , I would be born with both arms .
No . Unless you wish to actually undertake the study of the relevant science , that 's what you need to do . Creationists do the same thing . the problem is that creationists tend to accept the word of those who are n't any more educated than they are . Thus , a creationist will accept Hovind 's dust on the moon argument or his shrinking sun argument as `` proof '' of a young earth .
How do you define evolution ? If you do n't see any , then you are n't using the definition used by evolutionary biologists . The question is who should define the vocabulary of evolutionary biologist , evolutionary biologists or creationists ?
You must be assuming that the entire story is true . Again , how can anyone possibly answer this ?
But you just said that the program was designed . You seem to be having trouble making up your mind .
But there were not always laws on the books that prevented these things . I was presenting a hypothetical situation in which those laws are not already on the books . The situtation was intended to show only that a ruling allowing same-sex marriage would not have to cost companies a dime .
The idea that this proves a young Earth is incorrect . This link can help explain that : http : //www.skepticfiles.org/evolut/gentrypo.htm
That science is all wrong
But if this was a republican program , you 'd have no problem with it . You are a rightwing hypocrite , Archie Baby .
Eating cooked food is a change in diet , evolutionary speaking its not different from if you stopped eating leaves and started eating fruit . Its still mutations that are resulting in evolution but the selection process for beneficial mutations includes social things as well as purely environmental ones .
Hell , one joint a day is n't going to kill anyone . But who drinks one beer a day ? No one drinks beer like that , or not many people at all , anyway . People who drink beer ( like me and you ) will drink a few one day , and for a few reasons . I like good beers , like microbrews and we have a few good ones here , so I like beer for its flavor . I also like the fact that if I drink 24-48 oz . of the stuff I catch a nice buzz . I also like to buy good pot . It smells great , tastes great and gives you a nice mellow buzz . But alot of people will come home from work and drink 3-4 beers every single day . This has to add up to bad health . A glass of red wine though is supposed to be good for you . ( That must be why I drink it so often . ) Anyway , you 're going way overboard with what marijuana does to people . It 's truly less harmful than alcohol , it can only interfere with your life if you let it . The person who would do this would do it with anything . If pot did n't exist or alcohol didn ; t exist , they ; d find some way to screw up their lives . This does n't mean that there are n't millions of responsible casual pot smokers who lead normal productive lives . You probably come into contact with tons of closet smokers and do n't even realize it .
Which issues ? The health issues ? Pregnancy does not physically impact the health of men . Ever . They do n't get pregnant .
Why is gun control more likely to increase crime that reducing it ? Mind telling us about your own `` research '' ? You are right about the people who would give uop their gun . It would be the law-abiding ones , but you are saying this as if they would do something immoral .
So ? My source is more recent . Would n't it make more sense to use a more recent source to determine whose side he is currently on ?
Sir Issac Newton was an XXXXX and you are a genius ? Hmm . Let me think about that for a second ? Your god does not exist and therfore did nothing . My God only had to speak .
It 's completely illogical .
And , I 'm sure that Terri Schiavo was fully aware of all that Bush and radical rightwing religionists did for her and appreciates what they did .
No when talking about the ark , I like to agree on what we are talking about when using the term kind . And I like to give the person that believes in the flood the opportunity to define it . That includes whether they think dinosaurs and other extinct animals were on the ark . So Im interested in how you define kind and your opinion on the dinosaurs and others .
False . Beneficial mutations in bacteria have been observed in the lab . Far from wrecking the system , they allowed the system to continue to live while those without the mutations died : the mutations improved the system 's ability to survive and perpetuate itself .
I see that you lack the integrity to even learn how to spell the words necessary to discuss the topic . Let me help . That is Archaeopteryx . Those who have actually invested the integrity to learn what they are talking about and those who have studied evolutionary theory in detail know that A. is only meaningful when previously referenced and then , only when the species is also mentioned - in this case A. lithographica or A. bavarica . But since you ca n't spell platypus , why would anyone expect that you had actually done a detailed study to the extent that you could spell Archaeopteryx ? But , no matter . Your total ignorance of science is apparent from the very fact that you think that disagreement on some details casts a doubt on the grander theory . ( Of course , you do n't seem to see disagreements on major tenets of faith as evidence against your form of christianity , based primarily on mythology ) A minority of evolutionary biologists disagrees with the theory that birds evolved from theropod dinosaurs . One of those is Allan Feduccia , a favorite son of creationists , in spite of the fact that gives no credence to creationism . Creationists even offer quotes from Feduccia as if they were somehow supportive of creationism . Those who do are , without question , totally ignorant of the principles of logic and science . Disproof of one hypothesis does not support any other . Thus , any arguments against evolutionary theory are not support for creationism . Creationism must either stand or fall on its own merits . Scientists ( who were also creationists ) struck down a literal reading of Genesis more than 200 years ago . And yet , American fundamentalist creationists have reject their contradictory findings , based on actual study , in favor of the mythology of nomadic herdsmen .
You do n't say !
well if I do n't get an answer here I 'll just spread it around the whole internet . Fine with me .
Well , then we get into the sticky area of 'what exactly is a right ' and 'where do they come from ' . Personally , I believe that a right is simply a type of behaviour that is socially permissable . It does n't have to be encouraged or enjoyed , it just has to be tolerated . Now , there is a difference between what rights people actually have , and what rights you think people should have . They do n't have to come from some outdated and irrelevant constitution , and certainly are n't granted by any mythical god .
What the hell do arabs have to do with this ? There are hardly any arabs ( or even Brits of arabic descent ) in the UK .
So ... the cells have two equivalents of the digestive system and two of the respiratory system ( s ) ? I know that the cell 's reproductive system is unlike human reproduction , in that one cell duplicates itself and a person does not . I would also like to know what either of you consider to be the cell 's `` circulatory system . ''
if you can find an impartial judge , i 'll take you up .
Martin shot him , he should n't have been there in the first place ( besides I do n't think he i.d him ) . Cricket bat in the street ? he got off lucky ( the perp ) if that was all .
That is , not scientifically speaking . Of course , for abiogenesis claims , I keep this site handy . In particular , I would like to point out the second caption : '' Figure 2 . Original cellular genesis in retracement taped by Mr. Randall Grubbs . A large chunk of thermal protein ( 1000x ) is contacted by warm 1.0 % sodium chloride solution . On cooling , protocells stream forth in less than two minutes . ''
Do not tempt me ! Ye of little faith . I strike you down with this !
Would n't have mattered to me .
Please introduce me to someone who has no mother . The deductions regarding experiments in physics involve logic and logical conclusions based upon repeated observations of things happening around us . To logically conclude that an apple will fall to the ground if released from any given height above the ground has no dependence whatsoever on whether a god made all this matter that we 're part of .
I think that you missed the point of the argument . VT is arguing that the low birth rate in the West is attributable to high abortion rates and the high birth rates amongst Arabs creates a numbers game in favor of the Arabs . Since they respect life ( their own , that is ) more than the West , their numbers are growing much quicker , while our lack of respect for human life is causing the gap to widen .
However , who are you to decide who is and is not a person ( human ) ?
And tapeworms to an extent , they like in stomachs .
So you 're not wrong ; everyone else is a liar .
Yes , there is some disagreement on how to classify the fossils designated as H. habilis . What of it ? Yes , there is disagreement on whether the specimens themselves represent a direct ancestor or a closely related side branch . What of it ? The point is that these fossils are clearly intermediate in characteristics between modern humans and ancient apes . They do fit very nicely on the family tree , either on the direct line to humans or very close to that line .
If that was a compliment , why do I feel that I need a hot shower ?
Thanks . I guess I need you to clarify your question a bit - what does `` it '' in your question refer to ? There are two things that I can think that the word might refer to ( how I felt about the abortion , or how I felt about adoption are the two possibilities ) , so I 'll need you to expand on that for me to give you a good answer .
Careful Brady . It was passage of the 94 ban that lead to the democrats losing the majority of their seats in the house and senate for over a decade . More people than ever are buying guns , including many first timers , because they know Obama will support whatever gun control gets through congress , and they do n't like that . They know he 's going to go back on his promises to hunters and sportsmen , and that 's going to cost him big in 2012 . This is going to be a very short reign for the democrats .
now bear in mind that all this happened in one day ( day 6 ) . How many species of animals can a man name in a day ? OK , Noah is 9 generations after Adam , and according to the story , a generation was like 200 years on average , plus at the time Noah built the ark , he was some 200 something himself ( cant remember the exact figure ) . so say its 2000 years or so after the creation day . Anyway , its possible that not a lot of speciation took place in that time , plus its arguable that there wasnt a lot of migration away from the Eden area either . so all the animals in the Earth were relatively close-by , and there couldnt have been a great number of new or variant species from the ones originally created . From the Creation to the Flood , the story makes sense . multiply the number of animals Adam named in a day by 2 , and add 25 % for speciation , and thats the number of animals that needed to be in the ark . sounds logical to me but then again , its just a story ...
Philosopher , as per : `` I think the difference is that apes act on instinct . '' The answer is : What you think and what Science has shown during the past 40 years are two entirely different things . ( I wo n't even bother clarifying it . )
It 's a self-defeating question . You 're asking why numbskulls participate in numbskullery .
Ouch . This must hurt ( him , of course ) .
Hey sparky , exactly how do you think they were supposed `` to protect '' these thugs ? How many debates do you have to lose like the school claims on the student duck hunter before you begin to say you are either wrong or completely illiterate ? You gunning for one of the new yellow CS medals ?
So why do n't you just say , `` I do n't think there is a distinction between humanhood and personhood '' ?
And at last :
maybe firstly you should explain how god works ? In what way does he manupilate matter in defience of the laws of physics , where does he dwell , how can we not observe such a being ? And all the other questions of the supernatural . The theory of a god is actually a lot , lot more complicated than evolution as you have to explain *how* God works to get even basic science points .
Not as fanatically so then .
And I suppose you feel it would 've been better if she died at the hands of a knife-wielding killer ?
France
Butwhat of the fetus/babies that were wanted by daddy but not by mummy what does termination stop then ?
So what ? It 's old news . You do n't seem all that broken up about the Bath School Disaster , which was the deadliest assault to ever take place on school grounds , back in 1927 .
Because there are people who are trying to deny the theory of evolution it 's place as a vital part of public school 's biology curriculum .
Hmmm , you can not study the laws of logic . Thats like saying we can not study math because it as no effect on us . Try violating the law of non-contradiction in a test you take . Say to person that is giving the test , The wrong answer can be the right answer at the same time sir , because the law of non-contradiction has no effect and does not exist for me , beside its impossible it study the laws of logic or anything abstract like this test.
Yes there is honor in marriage but we are talking about a piece of paper that defines who is considered your family in the eyes of the law .
Another pretty important point is that , with respect to evolution there is , uh ... , no Controversy to Teach . The Discovery Institute and all the ID/creationist ilk have invented that proposition that the basic ideas of the mechanism of evolution are controversial .
Not many creationists accept it . Your later comment that it was a creationist who first proposed natural selection is in error . Natural selection was one of Darwin 's theories , also formulated independently by Alfred Russel Wallace .
You know , it 's funny that you make this claim , and then you link to a web-site that is titled `` peoplecanchange '' . Would you mind explaining why you linked to that web-site if my argument `` is unrelated to genetics '' ? Seems you want to have your cake and eat it too ...
Well , since a working definition of `` insanity '' would be denying observable reality , I would say that your argument is insanity . On a side note , how have you not been banned yet ? Any particular reason admin ?
So after misrepresenting me , you compound that dishonesty by pretending that you are innocent of the whole thing . You were trying to be funny when you misrepresented me and when called to task , you continue to lie .
1 It enshrines marriage as a hetero institution 2 It bans civil unions and all relationships between same sex people .
Because you do n't deny the truth of its claims . If you present the Bible as a credible source , then I can use it to eviscerate your position . Suppose I tell a multi-part story where King ABC is said to never lie , yet in one part , King ABC lies his little crown off . Either King ABC lied in that story and therefore does n't never lie , or King ABC really does n't ever lie and in fact did n't lie in that part . You ca n't have it both ways , but the Bible tries to have it multiple ways all the time . Even if you and I both think that the King ABC story is fiction , we can recognize this inconsistency and have absolutely no reason to believe that the story is nonfiction . Later you accuse me of having double standards . This is ripe considering the above .
Well the oldest fossils are ( IIRC ) 3.8 billion years old ... ... .
But there 's no evidence here for creation . All you can do is argue ( extremely poorly ) against an old earth . Three strikes and your out , kid . Hit the showers .
And here you are , claiming that judge Urbina ruled favorably to either Heller or for the side of the Second Amendment Rights ? He did not ! He tried to muddy the water and preserve the status quo of the failed D.C. gun laws .
Then why would you want abortions to be rare if you do n't consider abortion to be a bad thing ?
But a scientist makes his bones by clashing with what people want to hear and being correct . Eventually , if enough supportive evidence is accumulated , then old theories are overthrown . The problem with creationism is that there is no theory and there is n't a single thread of supportive evidence .
the answer is in your question ... legally own means just that . can carry it without further permission . but my question asks , is permission required to legally own firearms ? you know my answer to that question . -a|ex
Well , we can go through a list from Live human sacrifice , infraticide , slavery in the Roman empire , to sexual morality , and the treatment of Wmen - Mother 's and their children . We might need a new thread for this topic ! Most elucidating , and worth quoting is : In the Syballine Oracles , written by an Egyptian Jew probably between 163 and 45 B.C. , the author compared Jews to the other nations : The Jews & # 8220 ; are mindful of holy wedlock , and they do not engage in impious intercourse with male children , as do Phoenicians , Egyptians , and Romans , specious Greece and many nations of others , Persians and Galatians and all Asia. & # 8221 ; And in our times , sex historian Amo Karlen wrote that according to the sex researcher Alfred Kinsey , & # 8220 ; Homosexuality was phenomenally rare among Orthodox Jews. & # 8221 ; To a world which divided human sexuality between penetrator and penetrated , Judaism said , & # 8220 ; You are wrong & # 8212 ; sexuality is to be divided between male and female. & # 8221 ; To a world which saw women as baby producers unworthy of romantic and sexual attention , Judaism said , & # 8220 ; You are wrong & # 8212 ; women must be the sole focus of men 's erotic love. & # 8221 ; To a world which said that sensual feelings and physical beauty were life 's supreme goods , Judaism said , & # 8220 ; You are wrong & # 8212 ; ethics and holiness are the supreme goods. & # 8221 ; A thousand years before Roman emperors kept naked boys , Jewish kings were commanded to write and keep a sefer torah , a book of the Torah . ... .nothing moved me more than the Talmudic law that Jews were forbidden to sell slaves or sheep to non-Jews , lest the non-Jews engage in homosexuality and bestiality . That was the world in which rabbis wrote the Talmud , and in which , earlier , the Bible was written . Asked what is the single greatest revelation I have derived from all my researches , I always respond , i & # 8220 ; That there had to have been divine revelation to produce the Torah. & # 8221 ; The Torah was simply too different from the rest of the world , too against man 's nature , to have been solely man-made . The creation of Western civilization has been a terribly difficult and unique thing . It took a constant delaying of gratification , and a re-channeling of natural instincts ; and these disciplines have not always been well received . There have been numerous attempts to undo Judeo-Christian civilization , not infrequently by Jews ( through radical politics ) and Christians ( through anti-Semitism ) . The bedrock of this civilization , and of Jewish life , has been the centrality and purity of family life . But the family is not a natural unit so much as it is a value that must be cultivated and protected . The Greeks assaulted the family in the name of beauty and Eros . The Marxists assaulted the family in the name of progress . Judaism & # 8217 ; s Sexual Revolution : Why Judaism ( and then Christianity ) Rejected Homosexuality - Click Here
I 'd be happy to . The concept that I was trying to move forward was : the idea that - when we see a cecal valve develop , for example , we assume that it is newly engineered data to react to the new environment . Big question mark ! My point is that - the lizard was designed to survive in a neighborhood where eating leaves , was its best chance of survival . So that if a cecal valve became necessary the lizard was ready to go . Having the built-in redundancy makes this possible without missing a beat .
Oh for dumb . It 's almost more ludicrous than anything else . What they are trying to sell can never be guaranteed . Stupid stupid people .
I 'm not even going to comment on the '6000 years old ' statement . As to predicting the orbits of planets , it 's simple . Due to the laws of gravity , planets go in regular circular or elliptical paths . By observing a planet for a period of time and making measurements , you can find out mathematically how that planet moves , how long it takes to complete one orbit , where that orbit lies , how fast it moves e.t.c .
so we would penalize financially those who want to have kids ?
Throw just a few more genes into the soup , stir the DNA pot a bit , and POOF ! @ ( $ /|\ $ ) @
Yes , that is logical
You are missing the fact that the theory of evolution is the explanation for the observations . Evolution does not explain itself . The theory of evolution explains things from the single genetic code for all living organisms , to the observed nested hierarchy , to the progression of life apparent in the fossil record , to why organisms seem designed for their environment . I 'll say it again , because it 's important and might clear up some of your profound confusion . The theory of evolution does not explain itself . The observations of living organisms lead to the theory of evolution . The theory of evolution is not a goal of science but a conclusion .
My apologies for an unintended slight . However , I must blame my ignorance . You see , my experience with chemistry is limited to high school , and my experience with biochemistry is limited to the details of such things as photosynthesis , the Krebs cycle , and a few other biochemical processes covered in the education of a biologist . Of course , Miller-Urey are my contemporaries and I was thrilled by their results during my student days . What ammunition they gave us to continue keep our pet theories afloat so that the vast majority of the population can continue to be snow-blinded . I should also apologize to astronomers , astrophysicists , nuclear physicists , and ( most especially ) electrical engineers ( which is a `` magic happens '' sort of discipline ) . Each of the above depends on things that are not directly observable . No one has seen an atom , an electron , a supernova , or a pulsar . And yet these things are presented as facts ! Oh . Wait . They are n't . They are presented as explanations of facts . Now I 'm confused .
So what 's your point ? What does a charity 's balance sheet have to do with health care ? It 's charity .

Heh . On the one hand , science articles written for the general public are generally useless and often outright wrong . On the other hand , I do n't have an advanced degree in bio-chem or the like , so the summary did n't really tell me much . Hrumph .

If I search long enough , I can probably find someone who does n't think 2+2=4 . Does that invalidate it as being correct ? Waxy
MUSCARELLO v. UNITED STATES Now consider a different , somewhat special meaning of the word carrya meaning upon which the linguistic arguments of petitioners and the dissent must rest . The Oxford English Dictionarys twenty-sixth definition of carry is bear , wear , hold up , or sustain , as one moves about ; habitually to bear about with one. 2 Oxford English Dictionary , supra , at 921 . Websters defines carry as to move while supporting ,  not just in a vehicle , but also in ones hands or arms. Websters Third New International Dictionary , supra , at 343 . And Blacks Law Dictionary defines the entire phrase carry arms or weapons as To wear , bear or carry them upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket , for the purpose of use , or for the purpose of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in case of a conflict with another person. Blacks Law Dictionary 214 ( 6th ed . 1990 ) . These special definitions , however , do not purport to limit the carrying of arms to the circumstances they describe . No one doubts that one who bears arms on his person carries a weapon. But to say that is not to deny that one may also carry a weapon tied to the saddle of a horse or placed in a bag in a car . Nor is there any linguistic reason to think that Congress intended to limit the word carries in the statute to any of these special definitions . To the contrary , all these special definitions embody a form of an important , but secondary , meaning of carry ,  a meaning that suggests support rather than movement or transportation , as when , for example , a column carries the weight of an arch . 2 Oxford English Dictionary , supra , at 919 , 921 .
Oh , ye man of little faith ! I regard it as highly unlikely to happen , but one never knows ...
You mean Exodus 21:22-23 and you are using a contemporary translation of it not tradition . The traditional interpretation of this text , which even rabbinical scholars accepted for thousands of years , is this : if a man hurts a woman enough to cause a miscarriage , he reciprocates according to how much injury he caused her , i.e. , an eye for an eye , etc . However , if the miscarriage resulted in no injury to the woman , then all the assailant had to pay was a monetary fine . The fact that the Bible does not equate the assailant 's life with the stillborn 's life is proof that the Bible does not count the fetus as a person . Further more we should have found replications of your contemporary translation since the copying of laws in the Middle East was widespread . Instead , the Assyrians , Hittites , Sumerians , Babylonians , Hammurapi and Eshnunna all have similar laws that go according to the traditional interpretation of it . Lastly , if a woman gave birth prematurely back in Biblical ages it would have resulted in the birth of a stillborn . Saving premature babies is an achievement of modern science . Not God .
The church is unfit to rule on abortion because it acts on what benefits them or they 're ideas . Like what I quoted , saying that `` Thou shalt not kill . '' Thousands of not millions of people are killed in wars . The Crusades is an example . It does not say `` Thou shalt not kill except when trying to claim territory or to land or if the person being killed disagrees with you religiously . '' It does n't say that . The church seems to decide when it will follow it 's rules , and when not . Yes , war is sometimes a neccessary method of self defense , but the many of the Crusades were not neccessary . Most of them were failures , but Christianity is still the second biggest religion in the world ( if not the first ) . The church ca n't be allowed to rule on abortion when they disregard their own laws .
Actually , as long as any group is not breaking laws , their ownership of guns is legal . The KKK can even own guns as long as the KKK is abiding by the law . I noticed Brady refered to the KKK as a mob , I get the picture Brady thinks that if gun owners gather for whatever the reason , that we are mobs as well , but when his side gathers they are an organization . And no Brady , I dont belong to or associate with hate groups .
Because they are predisposed to addiction .
I think you need to read the book of Job .
If all you got in school was that the Spanish Inquisition was `` at times very strict '' than you have been a wee bit undereducated to put it mildly . Let me give you the cliff notes version- the purpose of the Spanish Inquisition was to find anyone who did n't believe exactly what the Church told them to and if they were found to be `` heretics , '' they were gruesomely tortured until they said they believed , or if they did n't they were killed . Now I hope you can see why saying the Spanish Inquisition was `` at times very strict '' is a GIGANTIC understatement .
So somebody try and tell us , that with stuff like this going on , that America still needs to overhaul its gun laws to bring them more in line with those of Mexico .
You revel in those beliefs , certainly - and not surprising either . All these miracles , and others , embody the personally comforting notion that for special people , the universe makes exceptions . This is a common feature of religions , from the oldest to the newest , ever since we were first intelligent enough to appreciate at a conscious level that there were things in the world we did n't understand and could n't control and which did n't seem to care very much about us , like lightning or crocodiles . As members of a species who have evolved the habit of ingratiating ourselves with other , more powerful members by making the right sounds and employing properly deferential body language , the idea of being able to employ the same techniques to get the uncaring forces of nature on your side is a powerfully seductive one . Certainly it 's more palatable than believing that sometimes the crocodile is already full when you happen to take a dip , and sometimes it is not . Got ta go , back later .
So I still maintain that reproduction is not a requirement for qualifying as living .
Now who 's choosing to believe something that panders to their beliefs without thinking too hard about the details ? Like I said : you 're much happier telling fantastic stories than thinking critically about them . Evolution has been a 'theory in crisis ' for hundreds of years now , and for an equally long time ID has been confidently on the brink of shattering revelations . Call me when something changes
Well of course . It 's religious people that are wanting it , and they have religious reasons . Duh ! What would you expect ? ? Or is this just another case of trying to fling any assertion you can at religious people ?
The argument is not that some women will seek out deadly illegal abortions , but that countless numbers of women will seek out deadly illegal abortions . The common claim was that 5,000-10,000 women died due to complications suffered during illegal abortions . These numbers were never recorded and have now come under great dispute due to the fact that those who used them admitted that they made the numbers up . If you mean to argue , then , that though countless numbers would not die , a few likely would , and thus abortion must remain legal , I think the nature of the claim renders the argument a fallacy . This line of reasoning seems to be saying this : because a few people might break a law , we ought not make the law . But , we would n't accept this line of reasoning for any other action . We would never say that because some people break the laws against murder , we should therefore legalize murder . Though a law may be broken , that fact alone could never justify not making the law .
No more circular than your . Except that your assertions are n't backed up by any evidence .
So , the cavaet is `` The death penalty is a deterrent in the USA TODAY ! '' I can live with that .

Do you actually have any idea how science works ? Why are you not embarrassed for creationism ?
Strawman argument , obviously you never `` said '' it , your inferior Intellect can not articulate what you really mean , it requires articulation by a Superior Being such as I . This the formal structure of your argument , citizen-slave , even if you are too slavebound to recognise Real Ultimate Truth .
There 's just enough truth in that statement to keep me from saying it 's false , but if I analyze it , it will help make my point ; The word `` evolution '' has such a broad meaning that it does n't have to mean atheism , but it since it is practically the only weapon that atheists have to combat the religious worldview , that 's what it often DOES mean . If it should n't mean it , but it is used so that it does , then that 's what it actually means . Creationism means religion , but it also involves a belief in the authenticity of historical documents that have been meticulously preserved over thousands of years . That 's not just religion , it 's secular , observed history - something evolution does n't have . So if a person hearing your statement does n't consider it carefully , it 's very easy to be mislead by it . It implies that `` evolution '' ( the branch that declares that the book of Genesis is false ) is somehow a secular , observable truth - while creationism is nothing but a religion , a superstition . Since evolution ca n't prove the book of Genesis ( ancient history ) false , and creationism does have some historical backing , they are comparable and they directly conflict . The problem is , a school teacher can make the statement you made , and it ca n't be legally questioned by anyone . Yet there was a case that I read about somewhere , where a sticker was placed in science textbooks advising children to study evolution `` with an open mind '' , and an ACLU lawsuit ensued . Of all those likely to be mislead by your statement , it 's young impressionable school children . Publicly paid school teachers misleading them with statements like that , without a full explanation ( prohibited by the courts ) does get an establishment of atheism started . It 's what I mean when I say that when church and state are separated , atheism and state are combined . Maybe government could be neutral , if it was small . The U.S. government is no longer small .

So you do n't believe that God took a rib from Adam 's side to create woman ? Genesis 2:21-23 `` So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep ; and while he was sleeping , he took one of the man 's ribs and closed up the place with flesh . Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man , and he brought her to the man . The man said , `` This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh ; she shall be called 'woman , ' for she was taken out of man . '' lurch : I do n't have time to quote everything you said so I 'll just comment on it . You guys keep saying that `` of course , religion and science can co-exist perfectly '' . When did I say that they could n't ? I simply said that fundamentalist Christianity and evolution could not co-exist . Catholics are a perfect example , they do not believe that they can pray to God directly . They believe that they have to pray through a priest , saint , etc . That is not fundamentalist Christianity . You keep trying to make an argument out of something that I am not arguing about . You also say that creationism can not co-exist with `` science '' . You say that evolution is science . If creationism ca n't co-exist with evolution , then how can there be any evolution believing Christian fundamentalists ? ( thistown for example . ) Creationism , by the way , is used very broadly . It is simply the study of how we were created , just as evolution is the study of how we `` evolved '' . They can be used to mean the same thing if you are a Christian who believes in evolution . BTW , science is n't the `` evil work of Satan '' . It 's man 's way of trying to explain something so that they do n't have to believe in something that threatens the way they enjoy living . ( The Bible . )
So is it safe to say you may be for pro-ignorance ? With technology ANSWERS become clear . Everything cost money . Education cost money , therefore knowledge has a price tag . Do you now suggest people do n't go to College because it too is yet another EXPENSE . Society should NOT be inventing equipment that advance our intelligence . Sonograms are great tool for understanding more to those women who have doubt . I do n't know about you , but I 'm all for empowerment with knowledge . Most people are `` VISUAL '' people and perhaps seeing the unborn may make the CHOICE clearer for the woman . I 'm for educating those from ALL PERSPECTIVES . Most people would rather see physcial evidence that a sonogram may provide than the RHETORIC of SLOGANS and IDEALISTIC POINTS OF VIEW . I know your kind ... '' just trust me '' is your motto .
Actually , you are misreprenting the scienctific answer in the following manner 1 ) It is not evolutionists , it is astrophysicists.. 2 ) It is based on testable observations.. 3 ) Based on the available data , it is about 13.5 billion years old . 4 ) It does not address the issue of 'Why we are here ' at all . 5 ) It is not based on faith , but based on data . If data comes into change that evalutation , then by all means , it will be changed . This has happened a few times when it comes to cosmology . Our technology is good enough about gathering information it would probably take a real major discovery to change things drastically at this point ( but that would be fun ) Although you claim that religion can do the same thing , that can not be demonstrated . You are also making the false claim that people who are religious can not accept science.. the only that that is different is that they do n't take the stories in the bible literallyi , but only as an allegory .
Really ? Let me see . Two creation myths and a global flood myth where 5 million `` kinds '' of animal were crammed into a big box that magically floats for a year - yeah , that 's secular history .

But what is adultery ? Mark 10:11 : And he saith unto them , Whosoever shall put away his wife , and marry another , committeth adultery against her . And if a woman shall put away her husband , and be married to another , she committeth adultery . Matthew 19:9 : And I say unto you , Whosoever shall put away his wife , except it be for fornication , and shall marry another , committeth adultery ; and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery . Strange that the gospels differ so importantly about what Jesus said in the same instance . According to Mark , all putting away is adultery , but Matthew says that her fornication provides for an out for him . Which is it ?
Here they are just quibbling over the method of abortion . One would think they would have the same objection no matter the method , so this is irrelevant .
So 43 % + 12 % = 55 % that oppose new laws in the Gallop .
You are right . Also , if the name was n't important to those like VOR , they would have no problem with gay people using that name of `` marriage '' . They know the name marriage carries with it a certain social significance and recognition that civil unions do not . That 's why they want gay people to use only the lesser term . They do n't want gay people and being gay , to have an equal level of recognition in this society .
Many who voted for this said as much . They 're hoping that in a few years gays will actually get full rights . We can only hope .
yes , that would be correct .

First of all , let 's compare the `` B '' specimen in this fossil link to the modern specimen and point out any significant difference to me . Secondly , shortly after the discovery was made of the living fish , but before the fix was in to excuse the massive assumptions evolutionists previously made regarding what the fossil represented , Nat Geo reported the truth about the claims evolutions had made prior to finding this fish alive and well and basically unchanged after an alleged hundreds of millions of years . One example that amply demonstrates the accuracy of evolutionary dating and sequencing of fossil fish , or any fossil for that matter , would be the story of the coelacanth . This is a genuine fish story . For many years evolutionists had assured us that the coelacanth , a member of the crossopterygian family and a supposed link to amphibians , had most definitely been extinct for at least sixty million years , at least according to their precise methods of dating and their exact analysis of the indisputable evidence of the fossil record . No doubt about it , the coelacanth died out millennia ago along with the dinosaurs , at least until a living coelacanth was dredged up off the coast of Africa in 1938 . Since then hundreds of live coelacanths have been found . In the June , 1988 National Geographic Magazine they featured numerous pictures of the coelacanth swimming around in the ocean depths , where they differ very little from the ones found entombed in the fossil layers , thus providing no evidence of any kind of evolution occurring for the coelacanth , despite the fact that the evolutionists say these fish have been swimming around for at least four hundred million years . The ancient coelacanths , from the first time they appeared in the fossil record were virtually identical to the living ones we find at the present day , extending all the way back through the geologic record past the Paleogene age of the mammals ( 63 million years ) , before the Cretaceous and Jurassic age of the dinosaurs ( 100 million through 225 million years ago ) , before the Triassic age of early mammals ( 200 million through 250 million years ago ) , before the Permian age of early reptiles ( 250 million through 300 million years ago ) , before the Carboniferous age ( 300 million through 370 million years ago ) , all the way back to the Devonian era , 400 million years ago in the fossil record , according to the time scale of the evolutionists . Initially it could n't be admitted that a living coelacanth had appeared that was identical to a species that evolutionists had calmly assured us was extinct for so many millions of years . Thus when a live example of this extinct fish had been found , J.L.B . Smith , a chemist and ichthyologist at Rhodes University in Grahamstown University , South Africa , pronounced it an entirely new genus and species , differentfrom any coelacanth previously recorded as fossils . Smith gave the living coelacanth a very scientific name , Latimeria chalumnae , after Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer who discovered the fish , and the mouth of the Chalumna River where it was captured . Just how different is this fish from the ancient coelacanth ? On pp.832 of the National Geographic article of 1988 , there is a study of the comparative anatomy between the living and ancient coelacanth with this caption next to pictures of each one . They state : `` LIKE CARBON COPIES , the tail of a live coelacanth and a 140-million year-old fossil virtually match . '' They go on to report : `` Few creatures have endured such an immense span of time with so little change as the coelacanth . The cut-away drawing of a present-day specimen seems almost identical with the 140-million year-old fossil found in a quarry in southern West Germany . It is that extraordinary lack of change that enabled Professor J.L.B . Smith in Grahamstown to identify the coelacanth caught in South Africa in 1938 from a rough sketch , although he had never seen a live specimen . `` ( 30 ) Throughout the entire history of vertebrate animals the coelacanth appears , differing very little in structure , showing absolutely no signs of evolving from one species and/or changing into any other kind of species through the supposed millions of years of it 's existence . It would seem that giving the newly discovered living coelacanth the status of an entirely new species and genus was simply to hide their embarrassment while they were scrambling to come up with some kind of an explanation as to why they had been so sure that it had been extinct for sixty million years . I think there 's something fishy here in what the evolutionists have been trying to tell us . This is true of virtually all fossils found , whether sharks or sand-dollars , they show no signs of evolutionary change to or from another distinct species . Evolutionists had long speculated that the crossopterygians ( the class of fish including the coelacanth ) , because they had bony elements in their fins , may have had the ability to walk while in the water on the floor of the sea , which somehow led to the development of legs to walk on the land . This scenario was put to rest when the authors wrote in the National Geographic article : `` Our films settled another question that has intrigued scientists : whether the coelacanth can walk on its lobed fins . Though we observed several individuals resting with their fins braced against the sea bottom , we never saw any of them walk , and it appears the fish is unable to do so . `` ( 31 ) It should be noted that the coelacanth does not lay eggs like most fish , amphibians and reptiles do , but gives live birth . Thus as evolutionists had tried to connect the coelacanth with some unknown link between amphibians and fish , this would put it in a rather dubious position as an intermediary candidate . The red-tailed sun perch off the northwest coast of the United States also gives live birth after nine months , two thirds of all existing sharks give birth to live , wriggling , little , sharks , some lizards give live birth , so a supposed evolutionary sequence demonstrating how fish , amphibians and reptiles lay eggs while only mammals and marsupials give live birth would be in serious trouble.The Fossil Record Here 's the relevant point of exposing how evolutionists dealt with defining the Coelacanth . Before evolutionists knew that living examples of this fish existed , they never even hesitated in taking the observable physical features it exhibited and thought nothing of creating a completely inaccurate and totally fictional biography of that fish 's evolutionary journey . They not only claimed that it crawled on the Sea bottom which proved it was an intermediary fish , but they made assumptions based on the fact that it birthed its young live rather than being an egg layer . Here is Hans Fricke 's own story regarding the investigation into the coelacanths natural habitat which Nat Geo 's story is based upon . And notice the last paragraph in the story . The Fish That Time Forgot - Sidebar - MSN Encarta IT SAY 'S THIS : I confess I 'm sorry we never saw a coelacanth walk on its fins . Professor Smith himself nicknamed the coelacanth Old Fourlegs in the belief that the creature actually did walk upon the seafloor like a seal on its flippers . Alas , that does not seem to be the case . For every myth we dispelled , however , I 'm certain there are a dozen fascinating discoveries still to be made . In short , we have just begun to know the coelacanth.So even though this man is in no way an anti-evolutionist , even he had to admit that what had been not only assumed to be true about the coelacanth , but had been widely reported as a discovery which was supported by documented fossil evidence , was a complete myth . Which I believe and assert can be said for all of the so called evidence which exists for the pseudo science of evolution .
I think the FSM threw these guys a bone . They cherrypicked which taxa would give them the most statistically significant results . If they were to expand the method to include more and more taxa , they 'd see the Noodly Appendage of the Flying Spaghetti Monster . Ramen .
Well , since the definition of marriage involves `` bringing together to make one '' then that does n't make sense . But , whatever , nothings stopping you . Marry yourself . I just did ( in the eyes of god ) .
That 's appalling ! In the US , if you do n't want to go to prison or get shot , do n't go around breaking into people 's houses .

That 's the UK idea of being civilized .
really ? Choice ? I never heard a abolitionists saying `` you can choose to have a slave or not ... haha .

And after amazing me with an honest admittal as to the true nature of the debate , Jyoshu jumps right back into obfuscation mode . The initiative `` did n't say 'gay marriage is banned ' '' . What it did say is that ANY union that is not marriage , which obviously includes `` gay marriage '' from the previous line and also `` civil unions '' , is FORBIDDEN from being recognized by the government . And to you that is n't `` banning '' gay marriage ? This logic is like saying `` whites only '' is n't banning blacks . You 're pegging the b.s . meter tonight !
I would hope not , since that would imply that god was the first to practice cloning , and it would be Adam and Adam instead of Adam and Eve .
How does anyone deny someone the right to believe something ? I do n't understand what you 're saying .
Yup . Give me an example of a true inaccuracy , instead of working to poke fun . Do you honestly think anyone will take you seriously ( except the evolutionists ) if you do n't provide reasons for your apparent problem with scriptures . Are you scared because you see the `` ancients '' commenting on subjects you thought science had `` discovered '' since the `` enlightenment '' ? Man , how arrogant can you get ? You remind me of the Pharasees . Arrogant presuppositions are no substitue for confronting your ignorance my friend . Either explain how the Bible speaks accurately on sophisticated subjects as given above , or do n't bother posting .

I have to agree with you . The Mother is usually the one responsible for conceiving the baby . The man should be responsible too , but she 's the one who will get pregnant and she has to consent to sex . I do n't think a woman should have the right to do what she likes with her body and kill her baby whenever she gets pregnant . I think the responsibility rests with the Mother first in this case , and the baby should not die for her .

How can you tell the difference ?
You are clearly against the Iraq War , and this is n't what I was planning to debate . I think the Pro-lifers have an edge on the contradiction between abortion and the death penalty because one is the ending of an innocent life , while the other is of a guilty persons life . I think every soldier who gives his life in a justified or an ambiguous war should be honored by all Americans for giving his or her life for their country , and yes , I do believe they are patriots !
But its not about what you want Matthew . My point was that you have no more right to marriage as these people .

That the thinking of some men is flawed does not mean the constructs of others is in error .
First , there is no `` us '' on your part regarding this . I am talking to you . Others here that argue your same positions have been much less beligerent , so as far as I 'm concerned your attitude sets you apart . Second , I was n't trying to give you justification , nor am I obligated to . You should be giving justification for wanting to redefine marriage as an institution which you have n't done . But I do n't owe you any justification . Take your silly games up with Mana'ia ; they wo n't work with me .

Well yes , but thats not what DEFECTIVE GULO indicates . If one has external sources of vitamin C , GULO can mutate to be inactive without causing a problem , and once inactive the inactive gene can be inherited without causing problems so long as vitamin C intake is high enough . An inactive GULO indicates that the species has external sources of vitamin C which is essential to many metabolic processes .

Actually that passage does not define a marriage . It just says that a man should n't divorce his wife . It does say that in the beginning god made man and woman . You can infer whatever you wish about that , but it does n't explicitly say anything about a marriage being strictly between a man and a woman . Besides , if current laws were actually rooted in the Bible , in this passage , then divorce would be illegal . But our laws are NOT rooted in the Bible , so the passage is irrelevant . I realize you were addressing a different point but I just had to respond . Here is the whole context though :
Agreed . Try telling that to congress .
well , many here think everything is opinion so whether it is a religious opinion or not should n't matter .
ah , but why do you use the word concept for both evolution and intelligent design ? Evolution is a theory that has been studied , given evidence , and offered up for peer review . Intelligent design is simply a concept , a single belief . Evolution is a theory that can be backed up and the world can benefit from it . How can the world benefit from a simple statement that there is an intelligent designer . This has absolutely no application to the natural world today .

You sure about that ? I think you will find that that view is oversimplyfied and not in accordance with the history of the subject . Big Bang : Evolutionists are not concerned with the BB , per sae . Cosmologists on the other hand are . In very simple terms we have a factual observation : the universe is expanding with time . If we say , what does this mean for the past of th universe it can be postulated that the universe then becomes very small and hot if we go far back enough in time . We then find that the laws that describe the behaviour of the physical universe start to break down ; gravity , electromagnetism , weak nuclear force and strong nuclear force . The pursuit of a Grand Unified Theory ( GUT ) and Theory of Everything is concerned with combining the laws that describe some or all of these forces to see if we can understand how the universe behaved very shortly after it began to expand . What came before ? this is not well understood at the moment . Some workers have suggested a cyclic universe in which more than one BB has occured over time . Do n't forget though , cosmology is only concerned with the physical world , and not that which may lie outside of it . Macroevolution : how do you know that this does not happen ? if you are to say it has not been observed happening today , it is not surprising as our slow life cycles do n't lend themselves to making a direct observation . If you posed this question in about 5000 years time , we may be in a sensible position to answer it with regard to a limited number of cases . Aside from that we have large quantities of evidence in the form of fossils that has lead us to the conclusion that macroevolution is a contiuous process that has been operating as long as life has existed on this planet .
Not ALL of them ? ! ! ! Come on , Simone , it 's doctors like Tiller that slaughter thousands , not their typical adversary .
The page linked to just above explains how a letter was sent to Dr. Raup asking for his statements about how he had been quoted by a Creationist journal ( one of the quotes being the one being addressed here ) . Of course Dr. Raups reply shows that he does not reject the fossil record , nor evolution , nor the fact that the fossil record documents evolution . The page also lists numerous other Creationist distortions of Dr. Raup 's statements .
because the question of whether or not a gay act is a sin is purely religious , and has nothing to do with law . read carefully what i posted
Yes . However , our great forefathers have supported something far worse than that . SLAVERY !
So now those that are opposed to even more laws on the books and a return to Old Testament practices are considered left wing ? Whats this world coming too ? LOL
I think it 's pretty clear that this is in violation of the Supreme Court 's current abortion jurisprudence , at least to the extent that one could actually figure that out . The question is , are there enough justices on the Supreme Court who would reverse the judge-made Constitutional Amendment which granted an absolute right to abortion .
Well , assuming that the slavery amendments to the federal constitution were repealed , then slavery certainly could be reintroduced . Minority freedoms are denied all the time . The right to murder , for example . I do not believe in the tyranny of the majority ; I believe in the majority 's right to legitimately wield its power . If we are not going to be governed by majority rule , then what will we be governed by ? If not rule by the many , do you propose we be ruled by the few ? Would you really be happy to live under a dictator ?
Ah , yes .
I guess I should ask why you think the `` less evolved '' chimpanzee should have gone exinct ? What happened is that common ancestor to chimpanzees . for some reason , was divided into at least two populations which did not come into contact with each other much . One population evolved into the modern chimpanzee ( a forest animal ) , and the other into modern humans ( a savannah animal ) .
Yes , T. Kennedy is the alias of a known terrorist , and Ted Kennedy got punished because of it . And many are advocating that such a system be used to deny Second Amendment rights and be used to try innocent people in a court of law .
And that 's what I 'm talking about . It does n't have to have been 'explained ' to me . I already know that 's your view .
Well , that was badly stated . But we 've been over this before and you still do n't seem to grasp . No one claims that any particular living animal is descended from any particular fossil . However , given the nature of life that we do observe , where we can see many species of equus , 36 species of cat , 28 species of canid , 8 or 10 species of bear ( with as many more extinct species ) , 850,000 species of beetle , and on and on , we conclude that life was similar in the past . And while we can look at a fossil species of theropod dinosaur and find many avian characteristics , we do not conclude that this fossil was ancestral to birds . But we know that there were probably many species of theropods that had avian characteristics , just like there are many animals with cat-like features . Recent discoveries are bearing out that conclusion . So we do n't say that this fossil is ancestral to that fossil or to this living organism . But we do say that this fossil shows characteristics that we would expect in an ancestral form . Thus , Archaeopteryx is not claimed to be ancestral to birds - in fact , is is believed to have eventually gone extinct ( in all three known species ) . What we do say is that Archaeopteryx shows characteristics of both theropod dinosaurs and birds . Is in one of a broad lineage of many species with such characteristics , at least one of which is ancestral to modern birds ( but we ca n't determine which one or ones that might be ) . And we have n't even gotten into the question of derived morphology . Why do n't we assume that dogs are descended from some very dog-like artiodactyl ? In fact , why do we conclude that these dog-like animals are , in fact , artiodactyls ?
So you 're accusing me of the thing that your most guilty of ? As I remember your posts have been censored several times by admin because you resorted to viscious personal attacks and name calling . And are n't you interested in the truth . Why is n't whether Jefferson said it or not important ?
Steve - its not about qualifications - its about impact . Women are the ones who get pregnant , we should have more authority in the matter .
Someone who does n't agree with abortion might feel this , but you need to back it up otherwise . We have no problem with ending billions of lives over the course of our lives , if we do n't think that they matter ( cooking and even having food , having an immune system , disinfectants etc ) . If you do n't recognise the organism as something worth worrying about , why would you ? I say that its more likely that its more an embarrasment for most people than a feeling that they have killed someone ( though to be fair , I ca n't back that up ) .
Well , ok. You 're wrong because evolving viruses are examples of evolution , as are bacteria and the new strains that have become resistant to antibiotics . But if you want some examples I 'll give three . I certainly hope that you have the courtesy to read them and actually think about them .
No . Not only are you wrong , you seem to lack the integrity to learn the basics of what you claim to oppose . You oppose evolution you say , but you have no idea of what it is . Most educated creationists not only admit evolution , they propose evolution at rates that make real biologists laugh .
Really , so California is just a peachy crime free place because of its strict firearms laws ? What about New York ? But wait ! Do n't forget good ol Washington DC ! Their crime rate is lower than Bush 's approval rating because of their strict firearm laws ! Of course they are going to have a higher rate of firearms death , but they 're obviously going to have a lower rate of everything else ( criminal related ) death . In the end , Its lower .
`` According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation 's Uniform Crime Reports , from 1997 to 1998 the nation 's overall crime rate dropped 6.4 % , from 4930.0 to 4615.5 crimes per 100,000 population . More telling is this continuing trend where crime fell faster in states that have strict carrying concealed weapons ( CCW ) laws or that do not allow the carrying of concealed weapons at all than in states which have lax CCW laws . '' `` From 1992 to 1998 ( the last six years for which data exists ) , the violent crime rate in the strict and no-issue states fell 30 % while the violent crime rate for the 11 states that had liberal CCW laws ( where law enforcement must issue CCW licenses to almost all applicants ) during this entire period dropped only 15 % .

There 's no mention of gays in the constitution .
No .
I think that 's more true of believers . However , when you manage to demonstrate your deity by opening his gates , do let us know . We 'll take a look around !
Bad comparisons . A fair comparison would be comparing the total number of defensive gun uses to the total number of gun crimes ( not just limiting it to gun homicides ) .
They originally might have been an arbitrary guess , but experience of all humans always has given them a very high probability of being true ( at least the existence of the outside world , the others are abstract logical concepts that do n't have a physical reality , just an abstract one ) .

So any long publication must be due to a panic attack ? It takes a few minutes to read those posts , but it takes an hour and a half to watch Expelled ; does that mean that IDers are having the mother of all panic attacks ? Your logic ca n't even be described as `` tortured , '' marc , because it 's completely nonexistent .
Well to start its a theory not a notion . Secondly if everybody already agreed on common ancestry with modification as the means whereby the species arose then why did anyone every think Darwin had anything new and novel . Simple explanation is he explained HOW such descent might be accomplished in a rational and testable context and provided significant evidence and analysis supporting his scheme . In other words his basic scheme coheres while the alternatives fail to do so .
But is n't the price of giving up your rights worth eventually becoming a socialist state where every aspect of your life is controlled by the government ?
So you define religion as the following : 1 ) Testable 2 ) Based on Experiments 3 ) Based on empirical evidence 4 ) Open to change based on experiments and new evidence 5 ) Validity based on facts , rather then Faith If evolution is a religion , so is Chemistry .
Because you introduced him to the definition of `` internet troll '' . It 's all your fault ! !
It did not because it was not clear till the 1970s that horizontal gene transfer was something to be considered . Nobody knew the mechanism till that era . And of course HGT is just another form of variability to be taken into account .
This is like saying that since I oppose the assertion that blacks are inferior to whites , I must think whites are inferior to blacks .
Thou shalt not commit adultery . I 'm to lazy to look for anyone dealing with premaritial sex . Adultery and premaritial sex are sin , because God says not to participate in them .
Well , yes . Eleven years is quite swift , but it actually supports the theory of evolution through natural selection . The estimates of the speed of evolution that you seem to be depending on were done by George Gaylord Simpson way back in the 1940s or 1950s . Since then , we have observed fruit flies , as well as other specimens , to evolve quite rapidly , showing significant evolution in only a decade or so . More recently , however , scientists have been able to observe evolution in natural settings and have found that it can sometimes be quite rapid when environmental change is rapid . Besides the studies that Reznick did on guppies , there are also the studies of the Galapagos finches by the grants , and studies of anole lizards in the Bahamas . These are observable phenotypical changes , not speciation events .
Well if you already know you 're for guns , then you should know the basic reasons , right ? Or was this an uninformed decisions ( I heard from my friend that guns are good ) ? But basically other people have said it . They 're protected by the Constitution , they generally result in lower crime rates , and they can be used for defense as well as hunting . Oh , but the burden of proof is n't on the people supporting guns , but those who wish to ban guns . Most arguments for banning guns are easily refutable .
So you have trouble with the American system of justice , do you ? Repeat after me : Innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury of one 's peers . Fortunately for our country , guilt or innocence is not subject to a public opinion poll .
He is not taken seriously because he gathers information only with his Morton 's demon in full control . supersport ploughs around the intarwebs , looking for anything he can crib and misrepresent . He 's gotten really good at cribbing and misrepresenting , but that does n't mean that he ca n't be refuted ... or has n't been refuted ... or has n't been refuted repeatedly ... or has n't been refuted repeatedly on numerous discussion boards ... If supersport spent half as much effort reading and understanding what bona fide scientists tell him as he spends looking for `` support '' and figuring out how to spin it , we would n't be having this conversation . Let 's put it this way . Suppose you have a friend named Fred who is in your section of organic chemistry . One day your friend comes in and says , `` Dude ! The prof 's off his rocker ! I have proof that he 's lying to us ! '' You ask Fred for some supporting evidence , and he disappears for a while . A while later , you see Fred again . `` Dude , '' he says , `` I told you . Check this out . Turns out that there are ways besides the so-called 'Grignard reaction ' to lengthen carbon chains . Wittig ! It 's all a ruse ! He 's been telling us about this , but that 's not what actually happens ! ( And man , do n't get me started on keto-enol tautomerization ; that one 's a real doozy ! ) '' You stare at him blankly , point him to the appropriate scientific papers , even invite him into the lab to run the experiment himself , but all he does is tout his own brilliance and avoid every piece of evidence you provide . Finally , Fred comes into lecture and tells you about his amazing theory that will totally overthrow all of organic chemistry . It turns out that sulfur can catenate , too , he says . This completely destroys the scientific conspiracy that organic chemistry is really about carbon compounds . In fact , Fred ends up approaching the professor -- someone who has extensive education , training , and experience in the field -- and tells the professor outright that Fred has uncovered the scientists ' evil plan to corrupt mankind and indoctrinate poor little college students into `` Grignardism . '' Incredibly , Fred does n't seem to notice that other students , the professor , graduate assistants , scientific articles , and common sense all contradict him . When presented with these problems , Fred pooh-poohs them away as a fabricated part of the conspiratorial establishment , as science as a whole has only one purpose : promoting Grignardism . Fred repeats this every week , with the same argument every time , dressed up just a little bit different . Every week , dozens upon dozens of refutations pour in , inundating little Fred with questions he ca n't answer and observations he ca n't explain . When even Fred -- the practiced little spinster that he is -- can no longer pretend in the face of such overwhelming evidence , he disappears again ... Only to start anew the next week . How long until you no longer take Fred seriously ? Do you think I 've made up this whole scenario ? Head over to IIDB and search for threads started by supersport . My story is a sadly accurate representation , although it is much too short to instill in you the understanding of the full depth of supersport 's ... `` behavior . '' IIDB has numerous practicing scientists and generally well-educated people ; they thrashed sport to pieces every single time . He finally made himself a nuisance and repeatedly broke forum rules so that he 'd be banned and could claim that moderators kicked him off because they could n't debate him .
Evolution is a science . `` Evolutionism '' is a word coined by creationists to make evolution sound more like a matter of faith than science . Likewise , creationsim is n't a religion , it 's a belief based on religion . Sorry to be nit-picky , but precision in language helps in these sorts of discussions . Bascially you are right . Creationism is based on relgious beliefs and so teaching it in public schools in almost any scenario violates the constitution . Creationists keep repackaging it to try to make it seem non-religious , coming up with intelligent design , for example . However , courts keep ruling that it is illegal . I think the only thing you 're missing is an understanding of how divorced from reality some creationists can be . They wo n't let a little thing like the law stop them from pushing their agenda .
It is the same as you saying `` you ca n't know anything of the unknowable ''
Your right , this is not complete free will . But as I mentioned before , if you give yourself free will , then you are saying God has no control over you or your actions -- and therefore he is not God anymore .
And this from the person who when I used to debate him and did something like this complained about `` parroting '' ? Hypocrite much ?
Gee , is endless ranting about SEIU Rush Limberger 's latest talking points ? Is this the latest rant from Dick Armey 's FreedomWorks ?
Nothing but unfounded assertion . No evidence at all . Just wishing and hoping . If it were not so pathetic it would be funny .
Well , viability now is around 23-25 weeks gestation and really is based on weight more than age . Howeverm the past push towards heroic intervention is now tempered by the rather horrific disabilities and complications seen at the younger age
We do n't need another one that does the same thing , and can put an honest gun owner in a jam . This is after all as Nato 556 points out , a due process violation . Do n't lie for the other guy . National Sports Shooting Foundation campaign .
That 's not the leftist agenda . They do n't believe in self defense and they do n't believe in the second amendment . They go into tortured logic to try and say the 2nd only means the states can have a militia . What they do n't realize is the Dick Act which started the National Guard codified the militia into 2 parts . The organized militia which is now the National Guard and the unorganized which is basicly those not in the NG .
I think you have your image of an assault weapon slightly skewed . an assault weapon by its very name is a weapon designed to harm another human . this does not mean full auto it just means that it was never designed to be a target/hunting/self defense weapon .
But it does restrict criminal access to such items . And it has nothing to do with Tyranny . If a government feels that a certain measure will protect its people and society at the cost of restricting an item that is dangerous I can understand it . It is not tyranny , it is a government doing what it is supposed to . Again I personally disagree with the decision , but I do not believe it is anybodys 'right ' to own a weapon nor do I equate such restrictions with extreme forms of government .
What liberals ? http : //www.republicansforchoice.com/ Last time I checked abortion was n't a clear cut partisan issue . By the way you implied it , you act like it is either expected or common for conservatives to be intolerant racists , homophobes or sexists . Oh well , thanks for playing the knee-jerk , partisan card for us . It is always a crowd pleaser . Next you can tell us about how liberals have a big laser cannon on the moon that is being used to vaporize decency and morality in America and how they 'll force 4 year old children into watching Brokeback Mountain at public schools from their secret base . Those dastardly liberals !
I think you guys are missing out on the fact that the Judge ruled that there was not injury done to Donna Santa Marie . So much for the arguement that the unborn human is part of the mother . What a disgusting and unfortunate case . It was n't born alive , so it does n't matter . What unsettles me the most is that some of you do n't seem to care . You sound more worried about the possible blow to abortion than the women who have been hurt .
For what it 's worth , I certainly AM bothered by this if it 's true . I 'd like to see the source where you got that information about the abortion rate climbing under Bush 's presidency , if you would . Of course , we also need to note that the rise and fall of abortion rates are not necessarily linked to who is president at the time .
Not answering for trebor - this is my two-penn'orth . If you 're going to describe anyone 'open to evidence ' as agnostic , then this is a word game : there 'd be by definition no ( reasoning ) atheists in the world . The ( negative ) atheist position is that in the complete absence of evidence to believe that a proposed entity exists , withholding belief is the default position - as with sinjin 's leprechauns . To call that agnosticism has always struck ne as mealy-mouthed : I 'd rather come right out and declare myself an atheist ( the negative or 'weak ' variety , like Big Bear Scot ) .
Almost every human today is living fine with 50-100 mutations .
Which makes your view of God exponentially disturbing . If man kills it 's wrong . If God exterminates millions , it 's morally just .
I 'm foolishly looking forward to this as if we 're going to see anything besides the standard baloney . How silly . ( Yes , I am still alive ; I 've just been incredibly busy and really hardly have the time even now to check in . )
How would you know about who winds up dead more ? You do n't prove anything either .
Sinjin this appears to be a typically Liberal response to a man who is clearly in trouble . Have you or any of your family ever had to sit with a shotgun on your lap when you should have been peacefully sleeping ? The man went to the ball game but was not allowed to return to his home . And for what reasoning ? It is his home for goodness sake .
Then why do you believe in it ? Many investigators now consider nucleic acids to be much more plausible candidates for the first self-replicating molecules . The work of Watson and Crick and others has shown that proteins are formed according to the instructions coded in DNA . But there is a hitch . DNA can not do its work , including forming more DNA , without the help of catalytic proteins , or enzymes . In short , proteins can not form without DNA , but neither can DNA form without proteins . To those pondering the origin of life , it is a classic chicken-and-egg problem : Which came first , proteins or DNA ? ''
If so , why do we still have apes , and why are there no transitional species that we can currently observe . Statistical averages say we should see a few hundred within the last two centuries , at a minimum .
If you want to argue that facts can change with our understanding , ie the world being flat , and are therefore not absolute , then you must also allow that 2+2 is not necessarily equal to 4 depending on our understanding , and therefore not absolute . Philosophically , I 'm not sure there are any absolute absolutes . Waxy P.S . I 'm beginning to understand the point you 're trying to make , ie where did the `` absolutes '' we observe in the physical world , and extend to the abstract , come from ? You say God . I believe the problem with your line of reasoning lies in your definition of atheist , as unkerpaulie and others have pointed out to you .
Well , it happens in virtually every thread . Some disagreements are between individuals of essentially the same basic system [ Protestant Christian vs Protestant Christian ] , [ atheist rationalist vs atheist rationalist ] . Many disagreements are between individual of differing belief systems . In such cases the individuals often use the same word to mean two different things . What is evidence ? Well , that will depend on your core belief system . Sacred writings may be excellent evidence for your belief system , but when you say the Qu'ran proves an issue , the Christian says Thats not evidence !  . One side tries to convince the other side that their core beliefs are incorrect , so they really have no evidence for their position .
... I do too . However , it 's difficult to follow your argument . That 's actually deceptively kind . Fact is , it 's difficult to discern whether you HAVE an argument . Or indeed that you have a position ( at least , a position showing any coherence or degree of development ) on evolution at all . This being a debate forum , it 's rather expected that one have a position on the subject at hand . Some in this forum are non-theistic evolutionists . Some here are Christian special creationists , some of these old-earthers , some young-earthers . Some , like me , are simultaneously Christians and evolutionists . The possible positions here are many and varied . Your position , so far as I can read it behind your terse posts , is that you wish to say to evolutionists something like this : `` You 're wrong . Evolution is ungodly . You 're doomed if you 're an evolutionist . I 'll pray for you ... '' Thanks , again , for the prayer . However , in this forum , without offering something resembling an argument , you 'll not persuade anyone of anything . Consider : In response to your posts , who WOULD change his mind ? As a Christian , let me add this , not wishing to be cruel , but to be instructive : Postings such as you 've left here tend , I believe , to contribute to the widespread belief among non-Christians that Christians are anti-intellectual , unskilled at argument and debate , closed-minded , and a little comic thereby . It 's not an image we need to further . My suggestion : Come out from behind your pulpit , and argue ! While you 're in scripture , check out Acts , and Paul 's visit with the lads at the Areopagus . See how he started his argument for the Christian position . Cheers ! Bradley
That 's not evidence , that 's an assertion . As for my dogs ( cats ) , yes . They do put on a winter coat in the much warmer winter climate than Arizona in which I live . So I return to my original question , on what evidence do you base your claim that an arctic fox would not change color in the winter in Arizona ?
Ralph Waldo Emerson , who may or may not have been an evolutionist , writes : `` I hate quotations . Tell me what you know . ''
Yea I know that , but there is no `` abortion '' pill that will terminate a fetus .
I 'd love to see proof of this

Would these be the same clouds that block out UV rays or do we still have to worry about ozone depletion , too ? Sorry , I let my subscription to the Journal of Chicken Little expire a while back .
And what is the point of this ?
Why would they ? What would be the purpose ? Are you somehow suffering from the delusion that evolutionary biologists try to somehow cause evolution ?
A democracy is simply a form of government where ordinary dirtbags like us have some say in the matter . You 've actually helped me with this , as in North Korea , Cuba , and the USSR under Stalin , your opinions certainly do n't matter to them .
Gee our reasoning challenged one has shown up . Let me see we have a NY slimes article on the problems liberals have caused in children . Then we leap to they never grow up . And then the leap to they get guns . Wonder what study or studies back that up ? From there we go into male hatred mode via hormones . Of course these are all white kids too eh ? Not to mention being of the Republican persuation no doubt .
I agree that the will to survive is an amazing phenomenon when put to the test . But I do not agree with your statement of life at *any* cost . There will always be a time when the humane/loving thing to do is to let an infant/child/adult go .
I know you said `` God '' however , you are wrong ( not unusual ) when you say Muslims believe in the same God as the Jews and Christians . More examples of your ignorance . By the way , everyone in the world believes in a God . For some people , it 's the 'Great Spirit ' , others 'Allah ' , then the true God , the one of the Bible , and lastly , some people do n't believe in a superior being , but they believe themselves to be god . XXXXX-
No , it means 'upright member of the genus Homo ' . You put too much faith in literal translations . The fact that the genus has been given a Latin name meaning 'man ' does not make all of the genus human , any more than Ichthyosaurus has to be a kind of fish-lizard .
Then why are you and other `` antis '' so hung up on preserving it for your exclusive use ?
The egyptians predicted his birth , death , WWI , WWII , and they have predict the supposed end of the world . Are you saying that this religion was wrong ? They predicted a lot more that I have not put that have come true .
Refine the system to include birthdates ?
True , but the one after this one will be . I think many sane people see the writing on the wall which shows this health care bill only gives you the costs of the current US system with the defects of a universal system . I 'm not much for conspiracy theories but if I were I 'd think the government was purposely driving health care off a cliff to get universal care in place .
So law-abiding citizens are being considered gang-bangers in California ? Yeah that 's really nice to know . Nice to see that government feels the people who put them into office are nothing more than criminals who ca n't be trusted . And the last sentence , `` There are also Second Amendment responsibilities '' can somebody please explain exactly what 's irresponsible about carrying your legally owned weapon , in a legal manner ?
Which would tend to prove that they population at large needed MORE guns .
Oh irrational-boy , please do try to understand basic concepts . It 's simple , I 've been through this before . If you know something of the unknowable , then you contradict yourself . It 's a self-contradictory statement . One you 're fond of , I realize , but illogical just the same . You can test this by trying to show me something that is unknowable . See the dillema you face ? Yes , self-contradiction . You may be so use to this feeling that you 've grown numb to it , but in black and white , you are making a self-contradictory statement . This is the same reason you have to have faith . Rational demonstration is useless when trying to show something without evidence or without rational demonstration , which is the case with your `` unknowable , self-contradictory '' idea of a god . This is why you MUST believe through faith , which requires no rational demontration . It 's no secret why faith needs no evidence , it CAN NOT use evidence , it 's the opposite of reason . Why do you think the term faith exists in the first place ? Reason does fine with the rational world . You needed a word to fit the irrational . Otherwise , why would you need faith ? It 's the same reason you can have 1000 different gods and beliefs of gods out there and not a single one is somehow `` more credible '' than any other . They are all based without reason , without evidence , irrationally . All ties together rather neatly does n't it ? Science > > Religion Reason > > Faith Rational > > Irrational Evidence > > No evidence Reason : Capable of seperating truth from false ( to degree , based on evidence ) , and thus produces knowledge ( That which we find to be true ) . Faith : Incapable of producing ANY KNOWLEDGE -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Stick to your side of the fence please , unless you adopt reason as your means . -Mach
And here it is , corrected to remove that little hint of sensationalism that you feel is needed to drum up support for your cause .
I seem to take a different approach to this objection than most people . The principle of NS is so painfully obvious that I have trouble understanding why people have trouble understanding it . For this reason , I can see how it does sometimes come across as tautologous . Two plus two may be four because we 've defined two and four that way , but that does n't make the equation untrue . Likewise , that those genes that help animals be better able to pass on their genes will be passed on more often ( due to whatever specifics ) is true regardless of objection . Whatever works , works . Those mosquitoes that are n't drawn to the zapper live ; those that are die . Those animals that can withstand the frigid winter live ; those that ca n't freeze . Why is this so hard to understand ? Maybe I 'm misunderstanding the objection ?
And it was . Anybody with a brain can understand that . Mayor Daley is white . A large portion of the Chicago population is black . Ergo Daley was keeping the blacks unarmed and helpless .
Well , that may be your personal approach to 'Evolution by Intelligent Design ' , but I believe that most people [ and the majority of human beings are not geneticists and/or molecular chemists ] would say that 'biological evolution ' , [ to their way of thinking and mine ] , is about whole organisms , not molecules . In fact , I 'm not the least bit interested in debating what atoms and molecules do , in and out of a test tube . So if this is where this discussion is headed , I wo n't be around for long .
I believe there is a point at which we ( society ) must be prepared to protect the fetus from his/her mother . Otherwise we sanction inhumanity .
The rich dead leave this world by giving Uncle Sam a boatload of undeserved cash . It 's called The Estate Tax .
That depends on the circumstances . Only she can know .
Felony possession of a firearm is five years in prison . Gun trafficking is ten years per gun . Murder brings the death penalty . None of these punishments are handed down for the crimes that get committed . It 's a matter of quantity over quality .
From my first post , starting with the quote from the religioustolerance website ;
That 's probably true . Creationists believe that theories are ad hoc stories . Creationist have been raised to know the answers before they have asked the questions . Thus , any assertion that supports the `` theory '' is considered valid evidence , even though there is no evidence to support the assertion and even though plain logic and real science show the assertion to be nonsense .
Which was this a response to ?
I think our culture is going to play a big role in this as well . I think that is where the majority of this problem lies .
No ... you 're not entirely correct . You can be skeptical all you want , but the empirical evidence is overwhelming for a world wide flood , a global cataclysm ... as I stated earlier , you 're not even taken seriously even in the secualar world of `` science '' if you try to refute the flood record , the flood is solid and is not privy to question . Enoch built the first pyramids , and his were superior in quality to he knock-offs of later days . The flood has been dated to have occured about 4400 to 4600 B.C .
Actually , the process of fossilisation is not slow and can be done relatively quickly . All what you need is for sediments to quickly cover a dead ( or an alive body - as what would have happened to Noah 's Flood ) and hence , fossilsation can occur rapidly ; evolutionarly speaking , fossils take millions of years to fossilise a bone , but unless the bone is covered by sediments quickly , the bone will never fossilise .
NO ! There are facts present that can not possibly be true IF SS 's theory is correct ! That 's the point . OK , let 's go back to basic deductive logic : True statements can not have false consequences . In symbolic logic : If H then C not C Therefore : not H That is , we have hypothesis H. It has consequences C. If you find that C is either not there or that there are consequences contradictory to C , then H is false . Neandertals and humans are lumped in one `` kind '' by creationists . Elephants and mammoths are another `` kind '' . Now , if SS 's theory is true , neandertals will have the same DNA sequences as humans , because it is a matter what genes are turned on and when , not a change of genes . ( This is even more pronounced because creationists insist neandertals ARE members of H. sapiens ) . Same for mammoths and elephants . So now we look at DNA sequences . Are they the same ? NO ! Neandertals and H. sapiens differ by over 3 standard deviations from variation within H. sapiens populations . So , the consequences are wrong , therefore SS 's hypothesis is wrong . No assumptions involved . Only data .
But why is that criteria of birth important , in your view , for calling it a person ? Is the existence of a person dependent on their physical location , in your view ( in this case , inside the woman 's body vs outside ) ? Otherwise , are there other characteristics that change in the fetus from the moments it is inside the body to the moment it is outside of the body ? How about when it is born but not yet disconnected from its mother by cutting the umbilical cord ? I understand that you might be stating this for legal reasons - i.e . defining person as born since the term person might automatically have rights attached and you do n't want any rights for fetuses - no matter what their state of development . If so , then I would say that you are putting the cart before the horse . In viewing moral issues , I think one should try to understand the fundamentals and then work legal opinions around those fundamentals - not the other way around .
And special creation has no nonmaterial cause for anything either . Come to think of it special creation can only rely on nonmaterial causes .

Indeed the court 's reasoning may have been as racist as your own . Indeed , the article describes how the court 's reasoning was even a surprise to the police officers ' attorney because it was so out of line with what is expected of conduct during arrests . She was not violent and she had an obvious health condition . Whatever you think about what she was intending to do or not -- though she communicated quite clearly -- is rather irrelevant given the offense and those surrounding circumstances . I bet this is your opinion ANY time the story concerns a black defendent and a white police officer . Because you 're a racist .
Actually , is n't it creationists who claim that the universe was created from nothing ? Creationists even have a magazine formally called `` Ex Nihilo '' ( changed to `` Creation '' because creationists did n't know what it meant . )
Let 's talk about the people in Sri Lanka , which has lost hundreds of acres in the recent past due to climate changes . Who , with just a few more degrees on average , will be completely submerged soon .

That 's the great thing about the 2nd amendment . It was designed to have the greatest impact after it is abolished .
And if I contrived a new language for us to have this discussion , in which it was impossible to express teleological concepts , would you then be forced to admit that evolution is not a teleological process ? Certainly you would not be able to say otherwise , but would your capitulation be merited ?

I am curious about your position . Why have you chosen the nervous system and brain and organs as the cutoff points for the humanmeter ? Have you done so arbitrarily ? Does this mean that if these are not as you said `` completed and operating ( developed ) '' then we are not human ? If this were true there would be alot of handicapped people who are not human . Christopher Reeve and all the other quadrapalegic and parapalegics like him would be in trouble . What IQ determines a fully developed brain ?
It has nothing to do with `` evolutionists '' and `` creationists '' . Some people are confused about relativity theory . According to relativity , the speed of light is constant , so a lightyear is a constant . The speed of light is unaffected by any changes in the observer 's time frame caused by gravity or speed . Regardless of whether we sit in a black hole , a white hole , a bounded universe or an unbounded one , if light from a star has taken 10 billion years to reach us , then the universe is at least 10 billion years old .
Because otherwise their argument is moronic and indefensible .

You know Duo , I actually agree with you here . I think it 's a method for BOTH sides to avoid dealing with other issues . For The Democrats , gay rights is a means of tokenism to get some extra votes . For Republicans , it 's a way to stir up their base to avoid dealing with unpopular policies .
The press shys for lots of reasons : -\ There has been no effort to either confirm or deny this story , probably because she wo n't come forward one way or the other . Without anything new to say or juicy video to show , the mainstream media wo n't bother .

You are no Christian , if you doubt the Holy Word in this subject . You are what John the Baptist called a `` generation of vipers '' ( son of snakes ) and Jesus Christ called a `` whited sepulchre '' . `` When Gentiles who have not the Law do by nature what the Law requires , they are a law to themselves , even though they do not have the Law . They show that what the Law requires is written on their hearts , while their conscience also bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or perhaps excuse them on that day when , according to my gospel , God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus . '' Romans 2.14-16 Remove the log from thine own eye before trying to help thy brother remove the mote from his . Turn away from thy sinful ways , and open thy heart to the Lord .

To be able to do `` anything '' , including things outside the knowable , is unintelligble . You can not even being the argument because you are arguing the unknowable , which is , unknowable . That 's the root . You can no more argue that god can participate in the unknowable , than you can do any rational examiniation of anything that has the attribute of being unknowable . It 's meaningless . If on the other hand you are starting with the premise that god is some entity that resides in the knowable universe , and is also knowable , then we can discuss this . And then `` god '' can not also be the creator of the universe , which means I can probably stop right there in the debate . Jim 's claim of `` god is omnipotent and omniscient , is equally nonsensical . Ominpotence can not be understood , it 's unknowable . But , to tie this all back into a more useful example : If God is omniscient , he knows everything that will happen and has happened . If God is omnipotent , he can do anything . That 's contradictory . If he knows what will happen , then he can not change what will happen , and is thus , not omnipotent . These are contradictory . So theists can choose , either to discuss meaningless things ( unknowable ) , or to admit that there is no god by classic definition . -Mach
Creationists intentionally misrepresent what was found . It was not blood , not whole proteins .
well this is reasonable response . But you have yet failed to show me how genetic variation applies to phenotypic evolution . It 's all well and good if genes mutate , but if there is no immediate selectable difference then there 's no sense saying Toe operates as advertised . I 'm trying to find a scientific correlation between genes ( and their actions ) and phenotype . I 'm coming to the conclusion that genomic evolution , ( in regards to phenotypic improvement ) is mostly , if not completely , a farce . In the cases where genes do mutate and have a beneficial effect , there seems to me to be no way to conclusively prove that these mutations are random . Heck , stick a bacteria in the presence of an antibiotic and what does it do as a response ? Mutate ! How can evos suggest that the gene somehow gets the signal to mutate , yet has no idea how to mutate or what to accomplish by mutating ? I think it 's pretty clear by the evidence I 've read that mutations such as resistance probably have an epigenetic origin , followed up by a genetic change . This means the mutation is nonrandom and the genome knows exactly what its doing .
You apparently know as much about law as you do about science . You would n't be arrested for having someone willingly consume a plant unless that plant was a controlled substance and last time I checked , poppy and weed were n't cancer cures .
So Darwin ( the naturalist ) did n't care at all about science or nature and was instead all about politics and destroying his own religion , huh ?
I think this is pointing out that an organism does n't start as naked DNA , its within a cell that has split off from another organism ( possibly developing inside it even ) which is being exposed to triggers from the environment . So far this is fitting with your view of evolution . The bit where you seem to get confused is to then think what are the triggers acting on ? Is the information that encodes the changes in the environment or within the genes - clearly if you put various organisms into an environment they do not all change the same way . The fish that get larger in the absence of predators are clearly going to react in the opposite way to the predators themselves . The key to the idea here is that they are triggers - things which then cause other things to create the effect we see . Genes are turned on , off or have the amount of expression altered by external effects , Bacteria have whole sets of genes that are generally switched off until the situation triggers them . Does this mean the bacteria have suddenly learned how to produce some essential amino acid , due to the innate property of an amino acid lacking environment , or that the environment has triggered a change in the expression of genes and causing something to happen that was n't happening before ?
I think you need to answer the same question I asked the other guy , who is God ?
How is marijuana `` excessively harmful '' ? Please define `` excessively '' . Do you consider marijuana more harmful than alcohol ? And , why would you want it to cost 5X the normal purchase price ?

As for the rest of your post ... seriously ... grow up .
Thanks Patriot for the well researched response . Although I am not a gun rights advocate , I am also not anti-gun and in the spirit of trying to get the two sides of this issue to reach some sort of understanding , here is what I believe to be the major points of those who support a ban on assult weapons . First of all , I do agree that the definition of assult weapons is a little strange , and it essentially boils down to the guns that look scary . However , the spirit of the law was to try to ban weapons whose main purpose was militaristic in nature . That is , guns that are able to be fired rapidly , have a large magazine , and reasonable stopping power . Thus , although the ban would not eliminate all of the `` dangerous '' weapons ( I assume that an M1 , the rifle that beat the Nazis , would be legal ) it does cover a lot of them . Of course , most 2nd amendment rights supporters would say that all this does n't matter , it does n't matter what purpose the gun serves , it is unconstitutional to infringe upon the rights of Americans to own any gun they want , no matter the purpose . What gun control advocates would say , however , is that the constitution says 'arms ' not guns , and it becomes the job of the goverment to determine what was meant my this . I think that most gun control advocates would agree that the second amendment probably did not intend for people to be able to buy chemical or biological weapons , for example . And , I for one , hope that is not what they meant , particularly in light of the recent war on terrorism . A common remark is `` why would it matter if I had a nuclear weapon if I am a law abiding citizen and would never use it against my neighbor ? '' The problem is that we do n't know what the intention of everyone is , and there are certainly terrorists in this country now who are American citizens and would use such powerful weapons against usif they were able to acquire them . Of course a semi-automatic .223 caliber rifle is not the same as a chemical weapon , but the point is that ( I think ) most people do n't think that you should be able to own absolutely any weapon that you want , so one must attempt to define what is too dangerous for ordinary citizens to own . I do n't think that I covered all of your points , Patriot , but this is getting long , so I will cut this off here , and I hope to get a response from you . I will be interested in your thoughts . -Dan
Sure , but then you get into all sorts of problems of classifications , slippery slopes , and other awkward messes . Arguing whether an embryo or a fetus is a person seems to raise more trouble than it might solve . It seems better to err on the side of caution and devise a pro-choice argument that assumes the embryo or fetus to be a person rather than worry whether they are a person .
Well then , using just the Bible , what is the value of pi to the third decimal point ?
Yes , I 'd say I do exist ( to answer your question ) . Furthermore , I do n't see why Matthew S has a problem with it ... .he is the one thinking we are `` at war '' and he states that he is willing to do the same things . I assume he finds this behavior during `` a war '' to be fairly standard and if the opposite situation had happened he would be all for it .
Once again , you prove Pandion 's asseration correct . Weaker species ? Who said anything about that ? Some species evolved to meet new niches , acquire more food , safer habitats . Hardly weaker . As for suddenly , you basically admit you are ignorant about evolution and sciences , which was Pandion 's basic asseration . They did not change suddenly , but over time .

Actually , the Miller-Urey experiment is basically so simple that with only a little training in the lab you could do it yourself . Please show that you are not a dupe and specify what you mean by `` organic matter '' . The experiment was intended to show that in a reducing atmosphere with a source of energy , amino acids can form spontaneously . Several similar experiments have been done since that have shown that the formation of amino acids is almost certain . For example , they have been found in meteors . But that was a long time ago . More recent work has demonstrated the spontaneous formation of lipid membranes , reproducing molecules . The information is available to anyone who takes the time to educate himself .
I 'm not sure what the means . I think that you have been listening to the creationist version of evolutionary biology . As an evolutionary biologist I 've never heard anything like that .

Things are better built following the instructions then going off of your own personal choices . I suppose you build your IKEA furniture based on intuition
Yes , it should be born . Who are you to say that a life lived in pain is not worth living ? Who are you to say that you ca n't help the child ? If you believe in the `` choice '' thing then for you to say this child should n't live because `` I '' would n't want to be like that is taking the choice from him/her . Thus , that is inconsistent .
It certainly sounds like a silly argument to me .
Me too . I just spent 2 1/2 hours a day in classes on Wed , Thurs , and Friday , and another 3 hours on Sat . Nothing wrong with learning . I have shelves and shelves of books , mostly about physics , cosmology , and biology . I 've also got a lot of old computer books ( that I need to throw out ) . But you need to understand that science is n't `` TRUTH . '' It is a process that tries to explain the physical world by observation , hypothesis , prediction and testing . Where we are still accumulating data there may be more than one hypothesis that adequately explains the data . That there are conflicting hypotheses on minor points is n't meaningful to the underlying theory . That 's how science works . When someone enumerates conflicting hypotheses of science , you should doubt their motives , especially when they do n't explain why it is meaningful . Be especially wary when they list debunked hypotheses as if they meant something . If you really want to learn about the topic , then check out Talk Origins . That site will tell you more than you can ever want to know about the topic . Good luck .
I believe this is a clear and concise way of putting it . Regarding number 2 , pro-life people believe there is a moral responsibility and , if the woman does not believe the same , wish to make it into a legal responsibility .

So St Peter was n't a Christian as he did n't have the Bible ? You are assuming that the Bible is the word of Christ/God . It is obvious from your definition that a Christian can believe Jesus is Christ and belong to a non-literalist Church Incidentally , I 've always thought capitalising Word for the Bible is an example of bibliolatry , associating it too closely with Jesus as the Word ( logos ) .

Because you can not reverse an incorrect United States Supreme Court decision with a ballot . Simple as that . Additionally , prior to 1973 , abortion was already settled democratically in most states . And , regardless of whether 99.9 % of the people in the US approve of the court 's decision in Roe , that decision would still be judicial activism , and as such , would still merit reversal by the Supreme Court .
I 'm curious , are you a creationist ( I have n't really read any of your posts on your personal beleifs , mainly I just see a bunch of insults toward ToE ) ? Because those types of insults are typical of creationists who are ignorant of the ToE . From what I DO know of you , you have quite the reputation over at IIDB , something to do with `` butterfly wombs '' which you claimed butterflies had .
But no one is trying to disprove it . But , the burden of any proof is on those making a positive claim . Unless there is a way to test for a designer , intellegent design is not science .
Please , so you actually advocate `` down-grading '' any union which does not raise children ? That 's simply insane ! Not to mention also highly unconstitutional .
And Jon Wiener says in his book that was because John Lott was protected by the gun lobby .
I believe that most women are n't in denial about what they are aborting . I have n't heard any women who have had an abortion call it `` a bunch of cells '' . I have n't heard any women post abortion not consider it a `` human being '' . I have heard the term `` fetus '' more than `` baby '' . This could be because 1 . Eases their conscious or 2 . It 's a 'more correct ' scientifically phrase . ( up for debate with some ) With the women I 've talked to , if they 've had an `` early on '' abortion they feel less like it was a baby and more like it was an unknown that lacked personification b/c it lacked personality , they could n't feel it , they did n't `` show '' , they did n't allow themselves to name it , use their imagination over what kind of person it would grow up to be , etc . Denial ? Perhaps . I think it 's a choice they make in their best interests , and they have to come to terms with their conscience . If they can not come to terms with their conscience regarding having an abortion , then they have the child .
Besides , EVEN NOW WITH REPRODUCTION cheetahs and birds and so on will eventually die out . Does that mean they arent living organisms ?
I see you are being a typo nazi . I see . You should n't talk to the Jewish people on how to interpret their scriptures , you have to go to the southern baptists to TRULY understand what the Hebrew mythology is saying . RIGGHT .
Did contraception fail ? In other words , maybe a difference between your situation and mine is that I was not intending to have children and took appropriate steps that failed . And I was n't just vomiting , that would 've been cake . I did the right thing .
Many of us view humanity with mental existence as important . The only ones you are protecting that our view does not are those human living entities with no mental existence . How can you even talk about `` harm '' to a living entity with no mental existence ? Are you `` harming '' and egg or sperm by throwing them out ? Are you `` harming '' a brain dead body that is being artificially kept alive on a machine by unplugging it ? Also , if the potential of a pre-mental-existence fetus is important to you , why is n't the potential of a unfertilized egg ?
Actually it is . All the countries with public healthcare systems rank higher than the U.S. We are number 37 . I thought we already went through this .
Stop moving the goal posts . My point was that the Supreme Court has been wrong before so assuming that the Supreme Court is always correct about an issue is unjustified .
Well the main difference is under the law ( and I do n't want to get into the right or wrong of the law ) a fetus is n't a person yet so they are n't making 'life and death ' decisions . Just as you said we must assume constitutionality , we can derive the legal distinction here as well . Punishment for an action against someone is different then a decision concerning personal health ( or privacy )
And I think Steven Weinberg said something like science does not make it impossible to believe in God , but it does make it possible to not believe in God . Maybe I have both the quote and the attribution wrong , but I stand by the sentiment .
olympic sports are legal , and use handguns too .
But only one qualifies as due process . I 'm anti-death penalty btw .
You ca n't accuse others of 'slight ( sic ) of hand ' and then produce this ! The same Home Office survey you linked to shows : 17 % of total violent crime was 'common assault with NO injury ' ( i.e . pushing and shoving , spitting at someone or verbal abuse ) 43 % was 'common assault with less serious injury ' ( e.g , a scuffle outside a bar ) 20 % were 'harrassment - no injuries suffered . 5 % were 'other violent crimes ' including carrying a weapon . Only 2.1 % of all violent crime led to a serious injury . The weapon most commonly used is , of course , the fist - in 78 % of all cases . In order to make this comparison make any sense we need to know how the FBI defines violent crime .
And for the other quote in Luke , in other translations , it says despise . Despise : To regard as unworthy of one 's interest or concern . And that has to be what Jesus meant because John 13:34 says , `` A new command I give you : Love one another . As I have loved you , so you must love one another . '' In other words , you have to love God more than you love your family . Here 's how the message translation puts it ( correctly ) : Luke 14:26 `` Anyone who comes to me but refuses to let go of father , mother , spouse , children , brothers , sisters - yes , even one 's own self ! - ca n't be my disciple . '' Mark 12:28 , `` One of the teachers of the Law came and heard them debating . Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer , he asked Him , 'Of all the commandments , which is the most important ? ' 'The most important one , ' answered Jesus , 'is this : hear , oh , Israel , the Lord our God , the Lord is One . Love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength . The second is this : love your neighbor as yourself . There is no commandment greater than these . ' ''
This , in a way , is another moral proclamation . You feel mental existence is of importance for existing ( or being of value ) . I 'm not saying that is wrong or bad ( well ... I do say that but just not right now ) but it is a moral stance .
Crackpot suggests that the environment changes to suit organisms ! More at 11 . Unsurprisingly , SS has abandoned another thread and -- unbelievably -- started another showing even more ignorance of basic biology . I did n't think it could be done . How silly of me . Well , I could just post the above , but SS would no doubt jump up and down having a hissy fit about how I `` was n't able '' to counter his points . So here 's a short list : Selection does not require inability to breed , only differential breeding rates . Ring species demonstrate precisely what SS asserts does n't exist . Selection is not survival of the fittest . Although much better descriptions exist , it could better be described as `` statistically preferential perpetuation of the fittest . '' Many primates fight within their own tribes to gain dominance . Infanticide is common . Do you consider this `` for the benefit of the population '' ? Even were there universal cooperation among populations , that would n't prevent differences in fitness . SS provides no quote or citation for the alleged assertion that [ a certain occurrance of ] evolution could never happen the same way twice . I would also like to point out that once again we have a broken link that shows that not only is supersport simply copying and pasting his baloney , his common sense is so lacking that after being called on this numerous times , he does n't even pay attention to the problem . Run , SS , run !
Yet to the woman the fetus is nothing more then cancer . The fetus is in her body and still should remain HER choice . Until someone comes up with a way for a fetus to live outside the body , without help , then it is nothing more then cancer and a parasite on the womans body . How about a compromise on this issue MEN should not have a say or decision about abortion and we all leave any legal desions to women . Since this is a womans issue let them decide and males but out .
And you do what many atheists do when they dont know what else to say , you clang the fallacy bell .

I believe you 're right : every word he writes including `` and '' and `` the '' is either a misrepresentation or a fantastic drollery .
Only 2,000 people ? Is that so ? How many have to die as a result of this bad policy before we get our dander up and start calling for changes ?
Is that the part of the scientific community that quotes Dr. Seuss ? Maybe if you ever said something closely resembling science , that would approach being a believable statement . Chloe , being a receptionist in a vet 's office does n't really qualify .
Well you know they are lying when they say that they do n't want to restrict citizen access .
How many late-term abortions in which fully viable fetuses are killed are acceptable using your warped sense of morality ? Mine says ZERO .
So Chicago has a total handgun ban , no exceptions for anyone except politicians with influence . Gangs are routinely armed with Chicago-illegal weaponry . The number of weapons has recovered has jumped to 7,000+ just for this year . And apparently Chicago thinks it knows better than the federal government . They 're not playing ball with the mandatory five year prison sentence that armed criminals are supposed to face .
This is the argument concerning 'choice ' that , to me , rings untrue and is a potential weak point . The whole 'when does life begin/when is it human ? ' is n't where those that favor woman 's rights should stake their claim . I support a woman 's right to control her body and I feel that one of the best ways to 'judge ' a culture is to see how they treat women . I think that it is imperative to allow a women to control her body , regardless of when life begins , etc ... Now I also abhor abortions and I extol responsibility . However , # $ % ( happens and a woman MUST be able to retain the ability to decide what to do in the event of an unexpected pregnancy . Now , considering responsibility important , I can understand and appreciate time limits and whatnot , because that is humane . But we should call a spade a spade ... a fetus is or will be human and an abortion does 'kill ' it . Its horrible that it happens , but we have to allow women that right .
Exactly . Even though you do not view it as a good choice , it still is a choice , and elminating that choice means that you do not care for a woman . Trying to preserve a woman 's God given right to choose , while giving her other good choices means that you care about the woman A LOT . Discouraging woman from having an abortion ( but not criminalizing it ) , and offering them better or other choices means you care about the woman AND the fetus . Attempting to criminalize abortion means you dont give a XXXX about the woman , and not much about the fetus either .
And reduction of abortion requirements by preventing conception is not in line with that position ? I see both issues tied to efforts of intent to control sex outside traditional marriage , again a belief system moral judgment ( sin ) , and inseparable .
No , the point was you said that `` noting grows into anything else '' , and I proved otherwise .
So , some parts of the Bible are erroneous oral history after all ! What a refreshing admission .
Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers , by their families : every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them . And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD . -- Numbers 3:15-16 Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot ; and also , behold , she is with child by whoredom . And Judah said , Bring her forth , and let her be burnt . -- Genesis 38:24 Exodus 21:22 ( RSV ) When people who are fighting injure a pregnant woman so that there is a miscarriage , and yet no further harm follows , the one responsible shall be fined what the womans husband demands , paying as much as the judges determine . But thanks for not having anything constructive to say .
So how would you explain fossils , pro-con ?
Oh it has happened . But that is not a problem with my son , me or his father - it is a problem for the pathetic hate-mongers who carried out the acts of harrassment .
I believe the question was `` who ? '' I 'm christian and I believe in evolution . Whether it contradicts the Old Testament or not makes no difference to me . Jesus contradicted the Old Testament . The Bible is the inspired word of God , not a dictation to scribes . Men wrote the allegories describing the creation of things . Saying that mankind took a long time to understand certain things is not limiting the power of God . He could have chosen to make early man Einsteinian , but He did n't . He could have chosen for mankind to bypass the flat-earth concept , but He did n't . He could have chosen for all humans to be highly intelligent , but He did n't . What He did was to leave us alone and let us figure things out on our own , including how long it took to get where we are now .
Medicare is a type of health coverage .
Any belief system is a religion loosely defined . I 'd like to know how you think rights are afforded to born persons if not by a belief system or at the very least a belief in natural rights . Either way , that does n't address the point I had . If I ca n't impose my beliefs on you then who you are to impose your belief of me not hurting chemist99a ?
To you , it may be an incorrect statement . But if it is , you have to tell me what it is you kill and take the life away from when you abort the zygote . Not knowing if it is being killed or not knowing someone wants to kill it makes no difference . Injustice is still practiced there , and not even some abortion doctors realize it .
I believe I read this in the paper a few days ago , but I think the ban will be similiar to DC 's in that it will ban handgun ownership . As for the constitutionality of this ? Since when have the Gun Grabbers ever worried about the Constitution ?
Please explain how ID is suppressed . It is taught as a hypothesis currently , and even if it were banned from being mentioned in schools , scientists can still do all the research they want on it . And you should know censorchip usually makes the idea more popular , just as banning the f word makes more people use it . Scientists would do research on ID , there is no suppression . You have shown how there may be benefit if there is a God and we assume ID is true . No specific examples , and no proof it 's true . This is simply a guess , a `` theory '' as used in normal terms . In the science terms that would be a hypothesis . It is currently taught as a hypothesis . The point comes down to the fact that the debate is n't about whether it should be taught as a hypothesis , but whether it should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution . You have admitted that not only does evolution have a lot of evidence , it has also led to many contributioins in science . You are the affirmative so it is up to you to prove that Intelligent Design should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution . So far you have shown that it 's an interesting idea , that may in the future lead to some good things . But you have failed to prove that it is in any way even close to the theory of evolution .
Here come the Christians , thinking they can know everything by guessing , and commiting the genetic fallacy left and right .
Nice site ! I like this from the list on the left : http : //www.skyangel.com/Programming/ ... nce=dangers & amp ; ~=
I believe he was talking about the two ends of the spectrum of opinions on abortion . With that in mind , `` minutes before birth '' would refer to those people in the far corner who think that abortions should be allowed even minutes before birth . Obviously , that idea is a little too radical for most people and from my knowledge , it 's illegal right now anyway . Of course , this is just my interpretation , if you do n't like it , then suck it up and wait for chaoticgnome to come back .
No , this is not about abortion , and I think that is very clear . If I wanted to discuss abortion , then I would mosey on along to the abortion forum and post there . The point about abortion that I brought up is that it questions the premise offered by thelmoose with respect to juvenile development . In fact , this point was made in the dissent of a Supreme Court opinion dealing with executing juvenile offenders . On the one hand , it is argued that juveniles do posses enough moral maturity to be able to have the same right to abortion as an adult , but on the other hand , it is argued that they do not posses enough moral maturity to be able to be held to the same standard as adults when it comes to the decision to commit cold blooded murder . For your convenience , I underlined the key parts . We have here two contradictory statements . That is what I was pointing out .
I only provided 2 to illustrate . I can also provide more . Also remember that I am falsifying your hypothesis : that parsimony is a method to determine correct hypotheses . All I need is a few to show the hypothesis wrong . It does n't matter how many examples `` for '' you have . Just as it does n't matter how many IC systems are not explained by Darwinian evolution . As soon as ONE was explained , IC as support for ID died .
There 's a difference between these tests . Accipitridae , ( and you by implication that you 've not picked it up and called him to task ) are mixing up the ancestory of individuals - giving a list of every single member of a family , to that of a species by species account . The difference is both of scale , and testability ; written records are n't as long lasting as biological ones . You should be able to use science for whole species ancestory ; after-all scientists can tell us with confidence that chimps are near relations , gorillas relations a bit further removed etc . Or , should we question those that tell us chimps are near relations ?
Because global warming changes what we consider to be pollution . CO2 emissions are only really a pollutant because they contribute to climate change , because the levels for CO2 to be toxic to humans are order of magnitude higher than those presently in the atmosphere .
Uh yeah , do you know what side you 're on ? You just supported my argument
I 'm not sure what you mean by either genetic determinism or neo-darwinism , but there is no contradiction between multi-purpose genes and evolution by natural selection , or the principle that genotypic alterations have a phenotypic expression . Just because a gene may have more than one function , or multiple genes make contribute to a single characteristic , does n't make any substantive difference to the theory of evolution , which you should recall was inititally developed before there was any understanding of genetics at all .
No , that 's a myth . The less gay rights activists push for complete equality , the less they are going to get . People do justify banning civil unions as well as marriage because `` gays deserve it for pushing so hard toward marriage '' . Of course , that logic is horrible , for people do not deserve to be punished because they 've asked for equal rights . But regardless , if gay rights activists asked for only civil unions , then people would feel just as obligated to suggest a compromise between civil unions and no unions , then they would feel obligated in banning that too , because gay people should n't have been pushing for civil unions . If we do not push for complete equality , there will never be complete equality , and no matter how many states decide to ban it , things will never change if this fight does not happen .
See Collin 's response below .
Actually gun crime in the UK is at a very low level . If you believe government statistics then gun crime is at its lowest level for years . Police travel in twos because it 's easier to catch people when there 's more than one of you . It 's been standard practise for years in lots of countries . The armour is mostly stab-proof and is largely to counter the rise in gang-related knife crime . It is legal to own weapons in this country , they are just tightly controlled , and as a result we have far less gun crime ( particularly where it 's not related to organised crime ) .
Not really . It just means that Homo erectus was around in Africa 200,000 and 125,000 years ago . So some of them stayed around in Africa . What 's your point ?
Try Islam . Even though many wars have been waged under the guise of Christianity , Jesus never preached that humans should force people to believe as we do . Muhammed , on the other hand , openly condones the spread of Islam by the sword . Look at Mormons . I do not consider them Christian , though you may not make that distinction . They are the most tireless of all .
It worked just fine for the first half of the 20th century . And training should never be a requirement for exercising a constitutional right .
You mental midgets insult my intelligence when you are n't even aware that the word omnibenevolent is n't even found in the Catholic Online - Catholic Encyclopedia . In fact , the word is n't found in any popular dictionary what so ever . It 's an urban slang with no historical usage in theological studies or history at all . I ought to know , because it never came up in Bible College , ever . But here it is in the famous and highly referred to URBAN DICTIONARY : Urban Dictionary : omnibenevolent Once again guys , get a clue before you start spouting off your criticisms which you have n't an actual clue about .
I think if you pay any attention , you 'll find only hetero characters in Dr. Seuss . I 'm sure if there were any suggestion of gay Whos for Horton to hear , the right-wing , anti-gay , pseudo-christians ( specific enough for you ? ) would be trying to ban Seuss , too .
Well , if you want to tell the truth , the theory of evolution is NOT a religion , it involves no magical deities , it takes nothing on faith . And since creation involves supernatural forces that are supported by absolutely NO evidence , it is not a scientific theory .
And immaterial formulas will not explain material reality . And note well reality so far as anyone can tell is material not immaterial .
Actually the question is `` is DNA close enough to conventional codes to justify the term `` code '' being applied . The answer is no BTW . So asking who encoded it is like asking who built a sanddune : no one did , it formed through natural processes .
The Biologist must have been thinking that a `` giant mushroom '' was the cause and evolve it . Now , that 's very funny !
So do Ludwig and Cook . One problem , they really could not find anything wrong with it . They only `` THINK '' someting is wrong with it . There maybe something wrong with it , but `` thinking someting is wrong '' and actually being wrong are two different things . Bellesiles is most definately a liar and there is no debate or confusion about it .
Damn fine job !
I think it would be more valid to say `` Whenever a decision does not go our way , the first reaction should not be turn AGAINST the courts ... '' And what other `` method '' is there for the minority who has the majority oppressing them ? Is the minority supposed to turn to `` democracy '' for protection ? Democracy was part of the reason they were being discriminated against in the first place !
Well since we seem to be having a problem with obesity , maybe this supports the theory .
But on the other hand , you are willing to violate a person 's right to privacy ( medical records ) in order to limit their access to firearms . Which right is more important ? - Your right to privacy or your right to own a machine gun ?
An FBI agent of all people , the federal standard of police and law enforcement !
it has been known for a long time -- it 's just been surpressed because it contradicts genetic determinism and neo-darwinsm in general .
Where to start . The term Marriage appears 41 times in the NIV ( New International Version ) . The term Marry appears 42 times in the NIV . But there are some relevant verses that speak to the rightness or wrongness of marriage in different situations ; most of which refer to moral issues which is something people in this generation do n't want to consider at all . For example , here the bible speaks about keeping the marriage BED pure and undefiled . Hbr 13:4 Marriage { is to be held } in honor among all , and the { marriage } bed { is to be } undefiled ; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.And here is where God consecrated the relationship ( Marriage ) between Man and Woman through Adam and Eve . He also gave Man dominion over all the animals of the World at this time . No where does the bible refer to gay marriage anywhere in the positive sense as the concept was never raised or dreamt of by anyone in the ancient world , homosexuals included . Only in this generation have the morals and values of society become so reprobate that these various unnatural forms of sexual perversions are seen as right and normal . Gen 1:28 Then God blessed them ( Adam and Eve ) , and God said to them , `` Be fruitful and multiply ; fill the earth and subdue it ; have dominion over the fish of the sea , over the birds of the air , and over every living thing that moves on the earth . `` Exd 22:19 `` Whoever has sex with an animal shall surely be put to death.Sex with animals was once a death penalty offense . Today , we have web sites promoting it . Lev . 20:13 `` 'If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman , both of them have done what is detestable . They must be put to death ; their blood will be on their own heads . ROM 1:26 Because of this , God gave them over to shameful lusts . Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones . 27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another . Men committed indecent acts with other men , and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion . 32 Although they know God 's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death , they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them . Now all one must do to rationally determine that God , through His word condemns the concept of homosexual marriage is to look at his attitude on homosexuality . If God considers homosexuality so unnatural an act and a death penalty offense under the OT Law , do you really believe that He thinks gay marriage is right , acceptable or normal ?
I know that the soul exists , which is why I made my claim . Just as sin is n't a man made concept but a reality that is proven whenever you feel guilty for doing wrong . I mean only sociopaths feel no guilt when sinning , are you saying that you 're a sociopath ?
And as far as we know , they are undirected . Evidence to the contrary ?
And I can assure you you have n't `` studied '' evolution : you have read/listened to or watched a bunch of liars telling you mistruths and falsehoods about evolution .
Yea . They would look like XXXXXX and waste a lot of ammo . Even the article at the end states they have a range of 1100-1500 yards , so not even close to a mile . The articles title is pure hyperbole . Those fire a .338 lapua ( 8.59mm ) .
Well , that just goes to show that you did n't even read the first post - Robbie quite clearly stated that its use was quite bothersome to him ( or her ? ) . I also find it to be bothersome , but maybe not as much as I would if it was a person like Archangel or JP talking about it - the way it is used in this article seems to imply that they are calling it a lifestyle but also calling heterosexuality a lifestyle : that homosexuality is an acceptable `` alternate '' one . I personally do n't like the term ( as robbie pointed out , it probably has to do with the source of the article being `` christianpost '' or whatever ) , as I do not view sexual orientation as a `` lifestyle '' , but if used while calling other orientations `` lifestyles '' as well , I do n't really get worked up over it .
This is so wrong in so many ways it 's mind-boggling .
Not sure who this was aimed at or even what it 's based on , but like Duo Maxwell , I do n't have a problem with those that are pro-environment , I consider myself pro-environment . What I do have a problem with is misinformation and extremism . There 's too much of both coming out of the `` pro-environment '' camp these days IMHO . Waxy
Well , that makes no sense at all That 's like saying atheists love the idea of a number so big that no number could be bigger .
By definition is undefinable ? So then God you can not claim that god is : loving , good , omnipotent , ominiscent , etc ... . Or do you claim such . Again I ask you describe what it is that you believe in ? Is your answer than you believe in the undefinable of which you do not know any further ?
Hollow bones however when equipped with wings allow for greater flight distance .
I 'm a product of public education .
There is NO such thing as `` pro-abortion '' No one wants every single fetus to be removed . All the more reason why each individual should be able to decide what is best for them at the time they become pregnant .
But it does go to show that addressing the reasons will do more than condemnation or criminalization . Not sure where you stand on those issues - but I am a strong proponent of doing more of this as a way to address abortion . All kinds of energy goes into the legalities . I think there are so many ways that both sides could work together .
Bigotry ? ? I have no idea what you mean there . Anyway , I ca n't speak for the other thread , but I raised an issue that no pro-lifer has addressed , including you . So if you want to really have a discussion , start discussing instead of bickering . Do you think that protesting a Planned Parenthood clinic might have an unintended consequence of discouraging someone from visiting who planned to obtain birth control , ( or a Pap smear or other non-abortion service ) thereby increasing the likelihood of an unwanted pregnancy ( or cervical cancer , etc . ) ?
Huh ? Please expound how the Gates , the Gettys , the Kennedys , the Hiltons , the Rockafellers dominate the poor with guns . The rich can afford and can legally own them right now . Are they enslaving the poor right now at the end of a gun barrel ? Please explain that if a common man can store , use , and own modern military weapons as safe or even safer that the state ; that he/she should not be allowed to own military weapons .
Why ? Since when do we attempt to `` emulate '' other countrys ?
But the Bible provides very little detail that can be reconciled with reality . Two myths do n't actually answer many questions .
Because both have different creation orders . Even if chapter 2 is 'specific ' that does n't even address the problem that the OP presented . Basically , what is the order of creation-chapter 1 or 2 ? Please justify your answer .
And yet all were done mainly by atheistic leaders whose atheism gave them the framework to justify what they were doing .
To date , not a single profetallifer here has managed to come up with a way that , should , God forbid , the question of abortion be returned to the states , any state would enforce its ban on the procedure . If State `` A '' bans abortions under any and all circumstances ( the Palin proposal ) , and State `` B '' has a very liberal abortion law , just how do the officials from State `` A '' prevent their pregnant citizens from merely traveling to State `` B '' to have the procedure ? Similarly , what are the sanctions State `` A '' would put in place to enforce its abortion ban , and upon whom would they be enforced - the woman ? the doctor ? So far , all we have heard is plaitudinous bloviation about the moral issue . Let 's get up close and personal . How will it work in the real world ?
And we can ignore the fact that a women 's body is designed for birth ( yes , I used the word `` designed '' , which many evolutionists use for the lack of a better term ) . We can also ignore personal responsibility for conscious decisions that lead to a pregnancy . Just keep ignoring and see where it gets us .
My list was simply one off of a website . I 've read through the Bible once but ca n't say that I was able to pick out flaws in it through my own reading . I was glad to see that someone with much more time and a keener eye was able to list out a few valid flaws on those websites . I remember the story that you speak of only vaguely . I suppose I should look it up and read it again if you could mention the passage . Anyways , the way you describe it , Jonah went to the cities , gave them a warning , they repented which canceled the warning , and therefore nothing happened just like God said . Jonah may have felt stupid , but the story makes perfect sense . All the loose ends are tied up . I guess you will have to expand on why you believe this is a failed prophecy .
Bare in mind they only conluded that after taking one parameter into consideration .
We call that an evasion tactic . That 's not the main point .
These official groups are jokes . Armed citizens are much more effective .
Well , no - that would be for teachers to do .
As an adoptive parent of 3 with decent knowledge of how 'the system ' works , it 's these annoying BS answers that tick me off . Perpetuating ignorance if not outright deciet to justify a decision to abort . As for caring for the kid once they 're here , that can be costly . More so for time . If you 're poor , EIC and earned child tax credits and deductions help alleviate the child 's cost ( the gov't wants another generation of consumers and tax payers ) . You can get your liability to near 0 and have the gov't kick back some money . But , we 're talking adoption . On top of these decisions , you also have consider the health risks fo carring the child to term OR the risks involved in getting an abortion . It 's nice to think that you 'll 'plan ' a child later but , life seldom works that way . I 'd hate to think that once you 're finally ready to have a child , your uterus has been scarred to infertility or have sever complications in conception , carrying the child to term or delivery . I 'd be ironic for another yuppy type who ca n't have children on their own due to an abortion to have to incure greater medical costs to have one or legal costs to adopt ... and maybe even seeking a foreign child as there are n't any easily to be had here ... since they were all aborted . Also , the older you get , the more health issues possible for the child . As for the intellectuals who wait to have birth later in life , watch Idiocracy starring Luke Wilson . Then smile as it IS the XXXXXX who are inheriting the world . But , what would you care ? You wo n't be here ... and most likely , neither will your decendents . If you want to kill it , then just kill it and say 'What 's it too you ? ' or even 'Yeah , so I 'm selfish and did n't want to take time out of my life to be bothered with details , bugger off ya wanker ! '
What are you talking about ... . This is the law : A well regulated Militia , being necessary to the security of a free State , the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed . How is this Anarchy ? BTW the article is being sarcastic if you did n't get it , It demonstrates the hypocracy of the lunatic fringe lefties out there ... Did Rosie bring her armed guards to san fran to get hitched ?
First , I did n't say everyone in the world was religious , I said everyone in the world believed in A god . Second , the majority of the world believes there is a god , and the others do n't want to believe ( hope there is n't ) a god and/or they believe they themselves are the only god of their body .
Also form the article :
Your experience with raw data is laughable . Your UK raw data says NOTHING about a causal relationship between guns and crime .
You mean like showing what the Scientific Method is , and why this invalidates all creationists claims of doing science as outright lies ? Do you want me to elaborate on that ? Or did you mean the challenge of the creationist lie of `` adaptation '' not being Evolution ? Do you want me to elaborate on that ? Or the inane claim by bertvan that living systems all can react intelligently to stimuli ( f.ex . I wonder how you think lichen react to stimuli with intelligence ? ) Is that what you wanted me to elaborate on ? What part of the # # # # , nonsense and lies that bertvan spewed is it that you want me to elaborate on ? Or did you want me to elaborate on some of the falsehoods and lies of yours that I have challenged ? Are you actually up to dealing with challenges to your spewed falsehoods , or will you run from that ?
Evidence of plague infested ships being used as weapons ?
So , what you 're saying is we should n't look at evidence and refine our methods and calculations when more accurate data allows for more accurate outcomes ? We should just make a statement once , and stick to that , no matter what reality shows us ? As to your 10 billion year `` gap '' which turned out to be not a gap but a differece that came about by using different data sets to calculate the age , first of all , why is this a problem , second of all , have you heard of the WMAP project ? It returned a highly accurate age for the universe .
So , evidently , you believe the `` government 's job '' is to hound , pester , and harrass its citizens ? ... .and here I thought `` we the people '' ran things around here . I guess my belief that the U.S. Constitution limits the governments powers is backwards . BTW : Just curious ... ... ..when the Nazi 's took control of Germany and started tossing jews into ovens ... ... ... .was the German government `` just doing its job '' , then ?
So false accusations are now your lie-du-jour ? I know you remember the numerous times that people on this forum have said something along the lines of `` If marriage is about love , then you should be able to marry your dog if you love it '' , as does anyone who has been on this forum for any length of time , so we 're back to your usual behavior . First you tell blatant lies , and now you 'll get all huffy that I 'm calling you on them .
I could imagine someone plotting the data , making a straight line fit , then extrapolating back 5000 and 4 billion years , then waving their hands significantly , as if the graph proved something .
Speaking of hog wash , who said this , EVER ? Not me ! But thanks for revealing how twisted and corrupted your thinking is to even imagine I have said or implied such an idea anywhere .
Just to point out , while not reconized by the feds , NY state will reconize it . http : //www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/10/25/je ... .ap/index.html Also , TRENTON , New Jersey ( AP ) -- New Jersey 's Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that same-sex couples are entitled to the same rights as heterosexual couples . But the court left it to the Legislature to determine whether the state will honor gay marriage or some other form of civil union . Advocates on both sides of the issue believed the state posed the best chance for gay marriage to win approval since Massachusetts became the only state to do so in 2003 because the New Jersey Supreme Court has a history of extending civil rights protections . Instead , the high court stopped short of fully approving gay marriage and gave lawmakers 180 days to rewrite marriage laws to either include gay couples or create new civil unions . ( Opinion -- pdfexternal link ) `` The issue is not about the transformation of the traditional definition of marriage , but about the unequal dispensation of benefits and privileges to one of two similarly situated classes of people , '' the court said in its 4-3 ruling .
They are not . Read carefully . Try to look at the big picture rather than limit your thinking to such a narrow concept .
But the law of angular momentum does not require that all parts of a spinning object spin in the same way now does it . If so then something like a rotary engine for an aircraft would not be possible !
And they should . It seems that they are not too bright .
And you offer none for your 's . Heteros engage is risky business as well . Therefore on the same grounds we ban straight marriage . It 's not just STD 's , it 's all sorts of physical issues as well . Cancers , hepatitus , bacterial infections , that result from anal and vagina sex . Add one word and BAM , it works aganist you .
Actually new organs are developed only by MODIFICATION of existing ones . But those modifications are due to chages in the existing physical and chemical structures . New chemical structures can however arise easily by mutation . For example mutation of a single base in chloroplast DNA results in effectively total resistance to the microbial peptide tentoxin . One can indeed turn it on and turn it off with a little genetic manipulation . In addition the specific mechanisms involved are well described in the literature . Glad to supply a set of links if anyone really wants to read them , but will not do so unless requested . CF1 I might add is one of the most important body parts to be found anywhere - most of our food supply depends on its turbine like function .
** Sez u . Your problem being that when you assert the assumption that your philosophy , [ materialism , etc . ] , mirrors reality , my reasoning repeatedly shoots it full of holes , and , quite understandably , that # # # # # # you off .
Another critical error . Evolution does n't say life is chaotic . Mutations are random , not natural selection or evolution . It 's a heavily guided process . We have already shown that the primary building blocks of life can be simulated and created . These formed into molecules and cells and so on . They can even explain how the human eye developled -- a recent discovery . It was an extention of light sensitive cells .
Heh ? That 's news to me . Most potheads I know smoke in parks , while heroin/cocaine addicts do n't use their drugs in public for somewhat obvious reasons .
Well , to argue so reveals an ignorance of the meaning of the word `` class '' . There would be no new class , as there would be no new categories above . Would there be more members of the `` married '' class ? Yes . I thought you righties thought more married folks was a good thing ? ? ? ?
Lets put it another way then . If the world did not exist or did not run by the theories and laws presented by science , you would think that there would be SOME experience at SOME point in reliably recordeable human history that people had which would have shown this . Experience is the only interaction we have with existence . If some aspect of existence exists ( ex . some hypothetical parallel universe ) that never manifests itself in human experience then we have no way of knowing its existence . We can guess but our guesses , not being based on experience , are completely arbitrary . Given that there are a nearly infinite number of imaginary scenarios that we can think up , the probability of the reality of any of those scenarious is miniscule . One other point : Say that the laws of physics ( which are derived from mutual human experience ) are wrong but just appear to be right and that some omnipotent being can change them whenever he likes . If these apparent laws have remained the same for all of recorded human time , then why should we suspect that they may change at any moment ? It all comes down to probability - if things are not what we expect they are from Science , then that should have manifested itself by now .
And how exactly do you explain the article mentioning the hand grenades and rocket launchers ? Are you saying that the average gun store has such items in stock ? Trigger 's link is much more accurate than yours is . Mexico Cartels Do n't Buy Assault Weapons from U.S. `` The next day I went into work and sat down with a trusted senior Mexican manager . I looked at him and said , `` I thought guns were illegal in Mexico . '' He chuckled and said , `` So you stayed in town last night ? '' As the conversation progressed , it became clear that guns are as common in Mexico as tamales at Christmas . Everyone he knows , including himself , own at least one gun . And , it matters not whether it 's a semi-auto or fully automatic , they 're all illegal , so why stop with semi-autos ? Though clearly illegal in the states in most instances , a lot of Mexicans have more firepower in terms of military weapons than we can only dream of owning here . '' `` These are not the so-called `` assault weapons '' you can buy at the local gun shop in the U.S. , but full select-fire military-issue rifles . Now , I know you want to know and are dying to ask ; Did I see any U.S. military-issue weapons stolen from the U.S. military ? Not a single one was marked with U.S. military markings . Everything was marked with additional foreign markings on the receiver , including M16 rifles , or they had nothing at all . I saw firearms manufactured in Europe , China , Russia and South America along with U.S. manufactured weapons . I saw rifles that looked familiar with no place of manufacture , no serial number or manufacturer 's logo . The information was not removed , it was never there to begin with . I can only assume they came from illegal arms manufacturers in India or Pakistan that produce copies of weapons . It was obvious that none of these firearms came from a U.S. gun shop in Tucson or San Diego . You could n't buy them from a gun shop in the states if you tried . '' `` Despite being able to own .22 caliber pistols or rifles , Mexican law requires them to be stored at an approved firing range . Where 's the firing range I asked many times ? No one knew of one . Where 's the gun stores in town to buy legal guns ? Gun stores ? No one ever recalled seeing one anywhere in Mexico , let alone their city . '' `` All this flies in the face of news articles published by the U.S. media in the last week or two . Mexico 's gun problems are a direct result of gun runners buying `` assault weapons '' in the U.S. and taking them into Mexico to arm drug cartels , says the U.S. media and government . That is a bunch of government and media nonsense . The cartels are n't arming themselves from U.S. gun stores with semi-auto AR15 and AK47 rifles . They 've moved on up . '' `` Cartels buy their arms from countries around the world , most any place where military weapons can be purchased on the black market , or from countries wishing to destabilize North America . They arm themselves from a worldwide black market of full auto military weapons including grenades , land mines and RPGs . They also `` procure '' their weapons from the less than savory from within the Mexican military . '' `` The drug cartels can easily afford to fly their weaponry into Mexico using their own fleet of aircraft on to remote airfields , or land them on remote Mexican shores from their fleet of vessels . They do it with drugs all of the time . Drug cartels buying semi-auto AR15 or AK rifles from U.S. gun dealers is viewed as a joke by Mexico 's drug cartel , most Mexicans , and unfortunately by the Mexican government . The only people fooled by all the political rhetoric are Americans listening to the likes of Attorney General Eric Holder and other anti-gun politicians . '' Latin American Herald Tribune - Mexico Arrests Cartel Hit Man in Execution of Army General `` In the operation , the Mexican army also seized 23 assault rifles , 20 handguns , 23 grenades , two grenade launchers , a rocket launcher , cartridges and ammunition clips , $ 42,000 worth of cash , six vehicles and radio equipment . '' Where the hell did the grenades and launchers come from ?
So , are you both still interesting in debating these topics ?
So basically your position is that since the California constitution is too easy to amend that prop 8 should be overturned and a few judges should do this . If this truly is your position ( and if not so be it ) than basically you have a few people removing the right for the people to amend their constitution . You would basically be asking the judge to make a constitutional provision unconstitutional . That would be remarkably horrific for our government .
How long ago were those instances ? Things have changed a lot in my opinion , over the years .
You know , its those happy-smiley cartoons that really freak me out . Is this just me or does anyone else find them creepy ?
You just committed one then ! Stick around brady , I reckon Bryan will be along directly ? Always ask yourself , what would MLK say .
It was obvious that this stupid argument comes up again . Bosnia : People there occasionaly owned guns , but what could a few familiy fathers do when the army comes and shoots everyone . Not much . Afghanistan : Do you really think that the Afghanis would have had the same chances against the Soviets without Stingers or CIA training showing them how to plan terrorist attacks ? Sure , without gun control the second-mightiest army would have never attacked Afghanistan ... Warsaw : That is your most stupid argument and it really makes me angry . In the ghetto of Warsaw , there WAS an armed uprise . The result ? The Germans massacred thousands as revenge . And if they had more guns , maybe the Germans simply had bombed the whole ghetto with their planes . Please don´t you ever bring on any arguments against gun-control by showing examples from the 3 . Reich . Gun-control got nothing to do with the increase of Hitler´s power or the way that WW2 went . The rest of your post I maybe reply to later , but it is always exhausting to write against any uncited and unproven claims ...
Really ? Can you support your point ?
So you are truthful , but I am a liar . Just like you are clever , but I am stupid . You have no respect for me , WW ; I 've never seen you demonstrate respect for anyone .
Some folks will never get it ! ! Some folks never had it and the rest have wierd ideas that some `` law '' will protect them .
I guess we just have different approaches then . To me a candidate should be held to questioning and challenged about any public policy issue , even publicly , rather than put a 'team mentality ' first and not challenge them on a stance because of already wanting them in office -- I tend to decide whether I want someone in office AFTER doing those things rather than before , and let such challenges play a part in whether or not I put my support behind them . An election is the time one SHOULD challenge them , not after they 're in office and there 's nothing that can so easily be done about it .
And so you have it ... Socialist lunatic fringe view that human lives are only worth what the government says its worth ... .
Kids can get teased for all sorts of reasons . Mother is too ugly . Mother is too hot . Father is a sanitation worker . Father is one of the teachers . Even family is too rich can be a source of teasing ... I think a better solution would be to target the bullying / teasing itself , for all situations ...
That would n't be friendly .
The VPC is hardly a real source . If any thing what this shows is the real and pressing need to close the border . Splain exactly how they get up here to do the dastardly deeds . What is interesting is how many laws were broken to buy and get the weapons back into Mexico . Sounds like a problem with lax enforcement . PS what exactly are `` cop killer handguns '' beyond an attempt to get the unknowing public aroused and enraged . The self same bunch of loons touted `` cop killer '' bullets and Hollywierd even jumped on the bandwagon with a movie . The only fly in the ointment was they could n't trot out a single case when a LEO died from bullets penetrating the vest .
I agree with you completely .
And it gave them a good springboard with most of the work already done to .
Really ? It must not be too hard to defraud a general election . Why would you think it was hard when there is evidence it has happened frequently in recent years , and in fact there have been reports of it at times going on back in U.S. history ? History would indicate it not to be hard after all . If someone is determined to do so , there is likely no aspect of our democratic process that is hard to defraud .
Demolishing your `` rebuttal '' in post # 14 does , however . You missed it .
Well humans if asked will tell you that they make choices among alternatives and this they may attribute to a capability which one can call free-will . Thats all observable . The question always boils down to just what is the underlying cause or mechanism which results in this property . Some free-will advocates will claim that free-will MUST be non-deterministic since if it were not it would not be `` free '' that deterministic processes can not lead to choice as they EXPERIENCE it . However this implies a depth of knowledge which they do not have - namely a detailed knowledge of the ins and outs of how their brain works . In addition a debatable assumption is made which is in effect that deterministic systems can not achieve that which is being experienced . This makes the claim that the free-will advocate KNOWS the actual limits of what deterministic systems can and can not do . Thats an assumption I am not willing to accept since nobody really knows the limits of behavior of deterministic systems . IMHO the experience of free-will is real enough , but the mechanism is materialistic and even deterministic down to its foundations . In other words IMHO deterministic processes are capable of generating the mental experience we describe as free-will . By the way - what is free-will free of exactly ? You do realize that it was originally formulated to get around the problem within theology of how to separate responsibility and accountability for sin from the sinless godhead ?
Oh ! Now that is what I am more accustomed to from you . What you fail to understand is that this is what the First Amendment was designed for ! Public discourse . But let me ask you a question . Do you feel the same way when people on the left do the same thing on issues you agree with ? Or is that the proper use of the First Amendment , while when we do it , that is just considered anarchy . What I posted was a 2nd wake up call ! And I will tell you that most people feel that way . That letter takes a shot at ALL parties . America does not belong to the Political Parties , it belongs to us ! Most of us are not revolutionaries . No , in fact , we are very law-abiding and Loyal Americans to the core ! But one thing the politicians need to recognize , is that we WILL vote you out of office . The first wake up call was the Tea Party protests . But hey this is a free country . You are free to ignore the warnings , but if you do , then you can look for another job ! The Constitution is the Supreme Law of the Land . All that the American People ask is that everyone obey The Law ! What in the World is so hard to understand about that ?
So who cares ? Last time I checked there was no law against guns with a high cycling rate .
Which abiogenesis theory do you ascribe too ?
Well , whatever . Behe and his buddies misuse probability in their arguments , which fall flat as a result . If someone wishes to make the claim that mutations are directed as opposed to random , then it behoves them to demonstrate a mechanism for the directionality . Mere appeal to miscalculated probabilities is insufficient .
** True , and the confusion was my bad , as explained already . However , the fact of revertant mutation in eusocial bacteria colonies , as demonstrated by Ames and by Cairns , still shoots great big holes in the darwinist assumptions arising out of your old war-horses , Luria & amp ; Delbruck '43 , and its `` clone '' , Lederberg and Lederberg '52 .
Registration leading to confiscation has not been demonstrated . If you care to give an example of a country where constitutionally protected firearm ownership was violated by confiscation , we could discuss it . Safe storage does present enforcement problems but that is n't reason enough to abandon the idea . Thefts and accidents will be enough to call attention to violators , although you guys generally do not want to have to report thefts . Why 's that ? What identification is the buyer required to furnish for a NCIS check ?
The OP assumes ID is real . Asking specifics is ridiculous because we do not know how the proof of ID would be revealed or exactly what the intelligent ' force ' or manifestation would be
Of course , since this has never happened , you really do n't need to worry about it that much .
But what about the hypothetical ? I ca n't think of a single child on this planet that has never been exposed to the ideas of the supernatural . So , what I was asking is whether faith is nature or nurture . That 's why I brought up kids being afraid of the dark , likely no matter what anyone tells them . I think it 's this fear of the unknown linked to the `` logical '' brain of a human that possibly creates this need for explanations . But faith involves specifics , so when the specifics are filled in and `` make sense '' to more than one person , these specific `` explanations '' can be passed down . So I do n't know how much of faith is nature and how much is nurture .
Well seeing as you are him and therefore you have access to his message box as you are again him , you know why his post was deleted unless you have n't opened your fake account 's message folder .
So lets say that if , and I know this has nothing to do with the topic of gay marriage , but do the people have a right to amend the constitution to introduce slavery ? Does the majority have a right to deny a minority freedom ? I already know you answer . You believe in the tyranny of the majority . Why do you want the people to vote to take other people marriages away ? I do not understand your reasoning on this . Besides you have never answered my question . Do you have any compassion ?
I believe Sinjin is right . Children are citizens once they are born . Citizens are naturalized or natural born .
The points individually have already been answered but actually you will find out that there is no complete proof for anything . No one can really tell you a definite answer to these questions . No one can be completely sure what happened , but at least Evolution gives more information and `` proof '' that makes sense . How could you prove me that your opinions are right ? Can you prove me that the Bible is correct and definitely the infallible word of God ? You probably ca n't , because no one can . Everything is just a theory , Evolution just as Creation ... So please do not ask questions where you know that people most likely ca n't give you a definite answer ( because no one knows it ) just to finally say that if Evolutionists ca n't prove it completely it most likely is n't true ... We all know that ourselves ... There are no real answers to any of your questions ... ( yet ) ...
Well , all Arch could do was attack Evolution . Your point is proven as well as my poll . Besides , the complete and utter failure for creationists to argue their belief on its own merits is a well known fact . There are at least three threads that ask creationists to do just that . There is n't any single one where they even try to do it . They always , always fall back on the false dichotomy of if not A , therefore B . But C through ZZZ may exist . If the sky is not orange , it is therefore brown !
Cops do it routinely .
The major problem is that Sodini and others IDed as CCW holders are in fact not permit holders . The media is just as guilty as these pervert organizations . Either they are totally clueless about firearms laws or they are out to carry the water for the pro slavery express . In Soldini 's case the closest he came to being a CCW holder was he purchased the pistols legally . He neither applied nor was granted a carry permit . The same was true of the Michigan case . We have no friends in the leftist media much to our detriment . Remember blood sells and the more of it the better it sells .
Well , as Jaaman see it , Heaven does forbid it ! I myself am getting worried , look at Virgina . They have enacted law that stops even relationship contracts and healthcare for gays and lesbians . If that were to happen in my state , my parter would loose his healthcare because it is from my work . ( He is self-employed ) . I read where people will just move to states where they feel accpeted , then others will move to states with laws that agree with their beliefs . Soon we will be a divided country .
And ? Ignoring your absurd claim that an embryo can choose its location , why does it matter . There is nobody living inside of the baby , it is not mentally existing . It would be the equivalent of chopping someone 's head off and calling the body a person .
You mean the whole `` seabed '' issue you deliberately wish to avoid ? You ever going to get around to how YEC does n't make any sense with oil and gas exploration ?
Evidence please .
You mean where the judge did the job she 's paid to do by ruling on the constitutionality of a law ? Or is this only a problem when it 's laws that you like that are ruled unconstitutional ? This is Civics 101 . If the legislature writes a law that is unconstitutional , it 's the job of the judicial branch to strike it down . The legislature can then rewrite the law , or get the constitution amended . I 've yet to see you demonstrate this process being abused in the matter of gay marriage . All you 've done is point out rulings you do n't like .
And did you ever hear that it 's not always a penalty but sometimes a benefit ? And did you know that if it would be a penalty , you 're free to simply not file your taxes jointly , which results in no penalty at all ? And certainly with respect to insurance , there are many benefits bestowed by marriage , as cmitch06 pointed out . This of course does n't factor in the countless other benefits of marriage , such as naturalization , food stamps , veteran 's benefits , housing benefits , greater ability to take out a loan , visitation rights , property rights , etc .
Thats a very good question . To be honest - I would prefer no legislation period - but I would not get up in arms about a late term restriction like I described because 1 ) a fetus could very well survive outside of the mom at that point , 2 ) most reputable doctors wo n't conduct an abortion at that stage without a legitimate medical reason anyway .
Not hardly . Show where they initiated it . Your first link showed it to be a reaction to the initiation done by evolutionists .
You are perhaps thinking of the Miller-Urrey experiment . No one expected life to appear . They were merely curious about what would happen if they simulated the conditions of the early Earth . Since then , we 've found pretty much the same thing in the interior of stony meteorites , including an excess of L-forms . So , it 's confirmed the findings of Miller-Urey . None of this has anything to do with evolution , however . Evolution is the change in allele frequencies over time . This happens in populations ; individuals do n't evolve . Everything else in evolution is an elaboration of this phenomenon .
Here you 're just flagrantly wrong . For info on the link between dinosaurs and birds , as an example , please follow this link and see the excellent post by pandion on this topic . And before we address the Big Bang , I should point out that the validity of that theory really has nothing to do with evolution . As for proof of it , we have the expanding universe around us , and the theory also predicts the same levels of cosmic background radiation that we actually see everywhere . Could there be other explanations ? Possibly . But the Big Bang is still the best we 've got .
And I would agree with you as long as all marriages for all couples were called civil unions and there is no two tiered system .
evolution is prefered because its immoral
I think there are probably more on the fence than there are those who are purely homosexual . I think many who are 'on the fence ' become homophobes to try to deny their idea and attractions . This is characterised by a lot of verbal condemnation with an equal amount of fascination about the sexual activities of Gays . Their big verbal condemnation is more to convince themselves than to convince others .
That 's fair enough , but I just think it 's important to at least acknowledge and realize that the unborn baby does have worth and importance , and not just a piece of tissue as it 's so often callously viewed .
Again , they must be alive . Previously , you submitted that there are many problems with society and life or whatever . Could it be that some people might be able to survive those problems ? Could it be that those survivors would be the ones to reproduce ?
This is why the title is `` God exists ! ! ! ( but he 's not who you think he is ) . It 's a funny proof which I do n't think Christians would agree this definition was God . But basically it 's saying that take the set of all human beings . Call the greatest God . God exists . Not only that , but the final conclusion is one of the premises . The proof is one big circle
Yes , just like banning marijuana in the 1930s has turned this nation into a nation of several hundred million criminals .
Oh brother , here we go again .
And I did n't . Did you note how I explicitly put [ Jesus said ] for the first two quotes from the Bible , but not for the third one ? Any idea why ? Come on , think ... you can do it !
Yes jitobear , pro-lifers value babies only in the sense that they punish evil women for their promiscous ways ! You have 'em pegged ! I do n't believe this is what she meant , and I hate it when people characterize those who are pro-life like this .
Why do you claim that I forged this post ? I 'll give $ 10,000 to the person who proves that this post was copied from any source other than myself . I 'll respnd to these other replies later .
Actually it is more than that . Yes conservatives will be back in power , but I have never seen so much discontent in America period . I do n't know where we got off track but I think it is this . We are Americans , not Democrat or Republican . Our allegiance belongs to the Republic , not to any political group . While we fight and try to score some kind of political points with each and every event , America is burning . Sooner or later , while we bicker endlessly , the American People are going to be fed up with both parties , and move into something yet not discovered . Heck , the way China is rising in material wealth , and while we mortgage our Children 's futures so that we do not have to feel the pain , maybe we will be just presiding over the destruction of the greatest society even known to man . All of this is possible unless we find the courage to work together for the good of all America , instead of just trying to play got ya with the other party . It is what I said a few days ago . United we Stand and Divided We Fall ! However , I doubt the Chinese will be anywhere as benevolent as We the People were . But it seems clear that change is coming , but I sincerely doubt that is has very little to do with the kind of change Obama Envisioned ! So belly up to the bar and Get Some discontent Boys ! After all we all have earned it ! We reap what we sow !
There was a break in a few miles away from my house last night . Will an anti-gunner please explain me , what my contribution to the crime was last night ? More guns more crime right ? Then everyday I am encouraging more crime by carrying my gun ? Very confused .
Yeah , stupid Rosa Parks . What was she thinking ? She did n't realize the price of acting outside the law .
So you think the money spent on gun buybacks was better spent there than on say , more hospitals , medical equipment or doctors ?
Voice of Reason ? Hmm He used to be in Military Intelligence hence the debacle in Vietnam . He probably still thinks that the US won the war .
Funny how they never claimed that naming a computer pointing device a `` mouse '' was blasphemous to Mickey .
Well , first , those were Hebrews , not Christians . Secondly , the scripture does n't say they raped them , it says `` keep them for yourselves . '' That could mean rape , however , I 'm pretty sure that was not Moses 's intention . Also , the Hebrews considered it impure to lie with non-Hebrew women or men , so if there was any sexual immorality going on it was very small . However , that DOES N'T mean it was justified or right .
That who knows ? Your use of `` we '' does not include many religious folk I assume . I would claim to know of much interaction that God has and has had with the world .
The value of logical reasoning is dependent upon your axioms . Highly religious people are no less capable of reasoning logically than anyone else - but the unshakeable axiom that their personal version of god really exists enters into every equation . For you , one axiom is the existence of Vitality ; volition made quantifiable , and the other is that darwinian evolution must be wrong and worthless in every respect . There is no logical reason for you to deride NS the way you do ; it 's an integral part of any evolutionary theory that seeks to explain the big picture of how the organisms we see around us came to be ; the occurrence of mutations , volitional or otherwise is not enough on its own . But your axioms prevent you from incorporating it into EAM and getting on with your life .
She could , but not all do Despite the fact that it works , there are still unwanted pregnancies That does n't change the fact that a pregnancy would not be pleasant to a woman who does not want to be pregnant Forcing pregnancy by law is a step toward fascism .
Recent studies apparently show that pot is more harmful than you say . One joint is said to contain more carcinogens than four tobacco cigarettes . I doubt your 20,000 joints theory . You have a simplistic argument going for pot . I ca n't agree that legalizing all drugs would be a good thing either . Programs in Holland have failed to produce significant if any benefits to society in general . The druggies seem to have benefitted by having arrest-free drug zones and access to whatever they want , but the cost of drugs still requires some income , something that most of them likely do not have other than from crime , begging or social programs . One `` benefit '' I see from legalizing drugs is that the users could be more easily identified .
Actually other forums have intelligent people adding new products . Frankly , I just consolidating their posts . Amusingly , I have yet to find a single creationist who can offer a single tangible , non-print product . If your belief was true , why is there absolutely no commercialization of it aside from books and print related material ? Maybe because your belief is absolute total garbage ?
Yes , our origins were probably in Africa . That 's where the oldest humanoid fossils are found .
Something need not be A nor B , but C , which is a different property altogether , such as 'reasoned faith ' I 'm still waiting for your turn on providing evidence on that one ... hell will freeze over .
The National Guard interpretation of the militia is totally false . The NG is a standing army . The militia is not . The NG can be federalized . The militia can not . They wear the same uniforms . The officers all know each other and play golf together . If the NG is the militia , then I want to have stock plies of weapons at schools , hospitals , libraries , and churches . No federalization of NG . Complete and total seperation of NG from federal influence , communication , and socializatlion , right down to even different uniforms .
Everywhere . There is not one single piece of evidence in support of creation and there is a mountain of evidence against it . Any claim that creation is anything but utterly disproven is a lie .
And now we know why Neanderthals be came extinct .
But only true love is not involved . There is the matter of a legal contract . Also , a child is not a consenting adult .
Only a fool could believe that getting rid of contraceptives , and other forms of prevention and education will reduce the abortion rate ! !
And who was this passage directed towards ? Not the general public I suppose.Just because the bible say 's one fruit and one womb is blessed does n't automatically mean they all are ! If that were true God would make sure there were no such thing as a miscarriage .
Given that this is the gun control forum , it seems logical to focus on gun control rather than other factors relevant to the crime rate . This is just a slimy attempt by you to misrepresent my position .
Well she had a # # # # poor lawyer , or there was more to it than the `` reality '' show was letting on . Check Ca.ORD . 12403.8 `` keyword ''
And this is evidence of creation ... how ? Please provide an explanation and a reference for how this is evidence of creation . Thank you ! : - )
Apparently I spoke well past your head ... not my fault . Any ways ... The Bible falls silent on the issue of abortion . You could n't find me a verse that directly condemns abortion if your life counted on it . And if the Bible is silent then what about theologians ? Once again ... nothing . Keep `` cracking up '' ... I suppose it is the only thing you can do .
This crushes ToE at the most fundamental level . I 've been telling this board for months that the gene is not the player in biological change that everyone thinks it is . The popultion has been told for decades that they are simply a culmination of their genes . How many times have you heard , `` It 's in the genes ... . '' ? ? ? ? Not only that but the whole theory of evolution is a result of changes in genes ( or alleles ) . Ha ! Now , however , genes are `` losing their glitter . '' Now , it 's RNA that seems to be `` running the show . '' How can it get anymore embarrassing for science that they got the premise wrong for all these years ? Why do you think the dude in the article said how `` depressing '' all this is ? Evolutionists have screwed up in that they have always assumed that the gene is the fundamental unit of life , that complexity goes no further down in the organism and that what determines what or who you are stops at your genes ! FALSE ! DNA does not dictate who we are , it 's the other way around : DNA is just a representative of what we are , where we live , what our social environment is , what our ecological environment is , etc . DNA is not a dictator of life nor does it define us ... ... it 's a follower of life and is manipulated by who we are . This reality indeed flips all of biology and ToE on its head . You can deny it all you want -- and I 'm sure you will because you have completely brainwashed yourself . The sun is setting on ToE . Science has lead us astray for decades , and now it 's coming back to bite them . What an embarrassment .
I think it 's hipocritical for pro-lifers to call themselves pro-life except for rape . It 's either a child or it 's not . If it is a child , then no matter what , the child must survive , becuase it has every right to . If the fetus is n't a child , then we can do whatever the hell we wnat with it . But it 's a child , since humans only produce children , and not being of other speices , in accordance to the Principle of Biogenesis . Therefore , abortion is wrong in all cases .
And , are `` birth '' parents obligated to the welfare of a zygote , an embryo , a fetus , do the zygotes , embryos , fetuses own `` birth '' parents ?
I will answer the remainder later as I am pressed for time . Archaeopteryx is not a transitional form . It has well defined feathers . Where is the evidence for transition from scales to feathers that is predicted by evolution . Natural selection in particular but overall evolution . If you read Gould 's original work he does not say what he says above and in fact actually contradicts it . It appears like a response that is back peddling at best . As I said , more later . EF
Strictly speaking , accumulation of mutations alone is n't what creates a new species ; so long as a species interbreeds well , it can accumulate or lose an arbitrary number of mutations ( variants of alleles ) ; though it may change in form it will remain one species . Also , a species can split in two simply through allelic segregation : no strictly new mutations involved , just the segregation of alleles that used to be distributed throughout an interbreeding population into two seperate populations that do n't or ca n't interbreed . It 's a mistake to think of species as strictly delimited in the same sense as biblical 'kinds ' ; indeed , the whole notion of a 'species ' is hard to define consistently . For instance , two species may ( at the moment ) be entirely interfertile but not choose to breed ( phenotypic segregation ) , or they may be able to interbreed but have offspring that have a greater or lesser chance of fertility ( eg horses and donkeys , lions and tigers ) , or they may be incapable of interbreeding . Trying to play it safe and say 'a species is a group of animals that can interbreed ' also causes problems in the case of ring species . Imagine looking down on a hill from above , and imagine a clockface superimposed on it . A species starts at 6'oclock and gradually expands its range around the hill over many generations . By the time the two ends of the expansion meet , at 12 o'clock , it 's possible that those two extremes of the population have ceased to be interfertile , despite 1 being still able to breed with 2 , 2 with 3 and so on around to 12 . One could then very easily create two species out of one by simply eradicating the population at 2 through 11 .
Other posters on this thread have much greater knowledge in this area than I. I would like to drop the science briefly and address this very beginning of SS 's post . One should always ask why people behave the way they do . Therefore this post raises some questions for me : Why would these `` world 's greatest minds '' behave the way they do , continue working to keep the population `` snow-blinded '' ( whatever that means ) ? Are all evolutionary scientists working in concert to achieve this ruse ? If a motive exists , other than the pursuit of knowledge , does this extend to other scientists ? Is all science a sham ?
Read-cap of above posts . Who do you think the ctitc was ?
This is not true . Rather , when there is conflict between one 's sanctity of life vs another 's quality of life , the sanctity of life must win .
The Brady Bill does not lower crime : http : //jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/284/5/585 A little dated , 1997 , but also note that both Cook and Ludwig were both anti-gunners . `` Brady Law Proponents : Ludwig , Cook , JAMA Among Lott 's harshest critics have been anti-self-defense academics Professors Jens Ludwig and Philip J. Cook . In a study funded by the anti-self-defense Joyce Foundation and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) they set out to debunk Lott 's findings regarding the Brady law . There was just one problem : they couldn't. `` http : //rpc.senate.gov/~rpc/releases/1999/gc083100.htm
OK just Google Haldane Cambrian Rabbit . Lots of links ! ! ! ! Of course Haldane while he predicted ( indeed feared ) his prediction did not live long enough to see it dug up !
There was nothing wrong with my answer . I did the correction after being insulted , double-standard huh . I am not entitled to my own opinion if it does n't agree with yours . I expected alot more from you , you 've let me down . Your obviously only looking at one side of the argument .
1 - It is innacurate . We allow killing in times of war , in self defense , and in state sanctioned executions . So we already have a situation where , when given X mitigating factors , it is justifiable to take a life . It is impossible to say all life is equal , and then to apply that as law . People will be outraged . I know I would be . 2 - Objective to who ? Who gets to decide how valuable life is ? And why should they get to ? And who says they are right ? The relative value of life works fine , thanks very much .
No , but my wife is !
So apparently nothing was stopping this from taking place then .
Held : 1 . The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia , and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes , such as self-defense within the home . Pp . 253 . -- Page 1 of the Heller ruling . Get a clue !
But you seem to have failed to grasp what science is and how it works . Before you can make the decision , you would need to actually understand why religion is n't science . It does n't seem that you do .
Well , this is a strawman.. I am not really sure what you are trying to prove except maybe you think it sounds impressive ? ? The line 'they assumed that the tonsils and the apendix were rements of previous specious ' is a total nonsense sentance , and renders the entire paragraph worthless .
That 's simple . In contradicts their religious beliefs . Either they 're wrong about their religious convictions , or the universe is wrong . And it certainly ca n't be that they 're wrong !
Well nothing , other than the fact that I do n't believe it to be true !
And the government can find a way to heavily TAX that alternative without a public outcry .
Well done Monty . Mark that up as your first ever 100 % honest and accurate post here .
just cause you dont buy it doesnt mean it is not true . that life is sacred does provide a ( if not the only ) compelling altruistic basis for and responsibility to social justice whether it is actually walked out or not . I think that the fact that it is not really walked out in america proves that the majority of americans are not pro life ( including a majority of those who actually claim to be pro life ) . This doesnt negate the truth though .
Actually the details of HOW embryogenesis proceeds is becoming increasingly understood . And it goes way the heck beyond speculation . Check out how homeobox genes work and how regulation by master switches is understood as just two examples .
Even though I am for gay marriage I do agree . Correlation is not causation .
But would n't the biochemical similarities speak for themselves ? That is , does one have to believe that the two specimens ( which share biochemical similarities ) evolved in order to infer that they will respond similarly to antibiotics ? The observable facts of the similarities would seem sufficient ( and more scientific ? ) .
Really ? Let 's see you show that the God that you believe in is that God.. and that this God even exists outside the imaginations of the mind ?
The problem you are left with lyteboy , is that I did n't try to do that at all . See ?
They should be discredited , and their hypocrisy should be exposed . Here we have people trying to deny other people the right to marry , supposedly in `` defense '' of `` traditional marriage , '' when some of them are out sneaking around , cheating on their wives , and lying about it when confronted . The only reason this guy admitted the truth is because evidence surfaced about his visits to prostitutes . Meanwhile , has has tried to advance his political career at the expense of gay people . Some defender of marriage ! This is a classic example of someone needing to get the log out of his own eye .
Is there anyone who does n't think species come from earlier species ?
Gennipher , 1 . In regard to your friends ' actions ... do you agree with abortion being a last resort `` birth control '' when contraceptives or humans fail ? 2 . Why does being against abortion exclude one from being against the starvation and hunger of children ? Matthew 19:14 `` ... Jesus said , `` Let the children come to me , and do not hinder them ; for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven . ''
No . Creatures do n't evolve . Populations evolve . If a portion of a paticular species gets isolated and evoves into a new species , what makes you think that the parent species has to die ?
This assumes brain-dead is a logical choice to consider one dead . Even so , it proves nothing about when life begins . What says they have to be the same ? This is a classic example of a conclusion not following from the premise .
Either you know or you do n't . You ca n't have it both ways . And if it is the fire ants , then why did n't you post a source for your assertion .
\ Looks like the Wistar engineers of 37 years ago forgot all about SELECTION , just like modern probability-hawks do ...
You are hardly in a position to be telling us what to do . What you have presented is a `` strawman '' argument , since it totally misrepresents any resemblence you might think it has to evolution . Was that your own idea or did you borrow it from somewhere ?
And nor does anyone else . I think you grossly underestimate the thoroughness of much of the science you criticise .
It does n't make sense because no one makes that claim . There are some random events that take place that may have an effect on evolution . That does not mean that evolution is random .
Thats another subject . In all , you have not answered the OP . The insane suggestion that abortion can not be murder , because murder is illegal and abortion legal .
You 're off on the wrong argument , clearly stated above is the issue of an indivudal pharmacists refusing service , a service that the pharmacy offers . If the employee picks and chooses who to service , based on religious reasons , it looks in black and white to violate the law , state and federal : The Federal Civil Rights Act guarantees all people the right to `` full and equal enjoyment of the goods , services , facilities , privileges , advantages , and accommodations of any place of public accommodation , without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race , color , religion , or national origin . '' Are you suggesting that 's not how the law reads ? Or are you still attacking the straw man you set up i.e . forcing a pharmacy to stock specific goods ... .which is indeed ridiculous , both to bring up and to defend , neither of which I 'm doing . The law will of course be interpereted , as will the actions of indivudals , but it 's clear that if discrimination is involved on the basis of religion , it is a legal issue . -Mach

Sorry to shatter you little world but this is happening it has been happening 25 years and it is happening now and it is completly legal no laws have been broken and yes there is a market for fetal tissue /limbs and bodies . Do some research you will be surprised what you will find .
Well I do n't support ever using the death penalty but as long as we 're saying there is the death penalty and allowing them to choose then definately do n't have retrials . They should n't want to send an innocent person to prison for life either so it should have been pretty clear they were guilty already . If they do n't want to kill an innocent person , stick to life in prison .
When the founding fathers determined that religion should not be established , nor prohibited from being freely exercised , they probably would n't have considered atheism ( the assertion that there is no God ) to be a religion , because at the time it was n't organized , or funded . The Judeo Christian religions were organized and funded at the time , as were other types of religion . They were n't concerned with what beliefs majorities or minorities had , they were concerned with impositions a religion could put on segments of the population with their organizational requirements , or money issues . They could see atheists needing protection from religion , but they could n't see religion needing protection from atheism , because it was n't organized . While it can be argued that atheism is not a religion , it ca n't be argued that it is n't an EQUIVALENT to religion today , with the organization and funding that it now has . 200 years ago , an organization needed buildings and meetings and transportation to be organized . With today 's communications , it does not . Just type `` atheism '' in any search engine and note the organization , and political action . I 'm not using the term `` atheism '' in a derogatory manner . It 's an assertion that there is no God . But today it 's every bit as organized and politically active as any religion - it has happened practically overnight , thanks to modern communications . It now has the same ability to impose itself on society exactly like religion , and is covered by the first amendment the same as any religion . It can not claim science as its god , and force it upon public education . 3 ) One of the most interesting things about this whole issue is the fact that the same thing , only reversed , was going on in the US 100 years ago . http : //www.campusmagazine.org/articl ... 2-2f7cc3afdb0f The concept of evolution was recently founded at that time , and some closed minded religious people were afraid of it , and vehemently opposed having it taught in schools . Today , the concept of intelligent design , ( void of any certain religion and its associated faith ) is vehemently opposed by closed minded Darwinists , who are afraid of it in exactly the same way . I suspect the same thing was at the root of it all 100 years ago just like today - concerns of how the money flows . Religious leaders seek funding - secular science seeks funding . If I would have been alive 100 years ago , would I have opposed having evolution taught in schools ? Of course I would have , because I would n't have been able to forsee how the benefits that the study of microevolution , genetics , and other non controversial aspects of evolution have benefited society . Chances are there are equal , undiscovered things about intelligent design that could be discovered it we would give it a chance . In the words of biologist Arthur Jones ;
Using the word trap in any way to describe the location of the fetous is stupid . Face up to that
No it 's not . Educating yourself before you speak might help .
No is the only answer one can make to that claim - its false . Indeed there is no claim made within NDS to `` creativity '' at all . NDS does not to deal with creativity which is a mental process . NDS deals with plain old biology . Evolution does not require creativity although NS does provide a non-random element to the process .

He 's been avoiding this challenge for months . It should be really easy to do if he were correct , yet ... nothing .
All of them since I do n't know what quotes you are referring to at all . Link to the post you are speaking about if you can . OK ? Otherwise , I see no reason to respond to anymore of your drivel at all .
I am with you here . It is n't .
As Arthur Jones described in the copy/paste in my first post , there are benefits . You have not addressed what it said .
Congrats , may your marriage continue to be a happy one . If I may deviate from the original thread a bit I have a couple of questions that pertain to your specific situation . If they are too personnal please feel free to say so . Do you consider yourself to be any particular branch of Christian ? ie . Lutheran , Catholic , Apiscopal ( sp ) , etc . How do you reconcile your Christianity with the portions of the bible that specificly deal with homosexual activity as a sin ? ( If this question sounds rude please excuse me , I could n't think of a better wording . ) Thanks
And it is . The ToE is a theory , however . It explains evolution , which has been observed . Do not attempt to deny that .
And because this man said it , it must be true ? A simple appeal to authority .
So you 'll post the title and the AP source but not the article or link to it ? It must be some damming evidence samiinh .
I believe the filibuster issue relates to voting on judgeships only . ICBM , but this wo n't affect abortion issues . It 's only recently that the Democrats have used the filibuster to delay the vote on appointed judges . I do n't think there 's any possibility of getting rid of filibusters all together . BTW , what 's wrong with a pro-life court ?
It is n't about truth . It is about explaining the evidence as best we can . You did get the second part correct about creationism . That is why some Christians are not creationists .
Well if your not too bright then you have to come up with arguments like this . Grizzly must not be very bright , noted .
There are some minimum requirements , though . The brain have to be able to receive stimuli and input . That happens during the 26th week of pregnancy , when the thalamocortical tract developes . Otherwise , it is no different than a computer that is turned off .
You 're welcome .
You mean you are as biologically ignorant and as easily refuted as the thread originator ? Yes , we knew that already . Why all the big letters ?
uh huh ... I 'm not buying it .
I see . Then you have none ?
Well , that last bit applies to me , but scientists otherwise epitomize rationality , as opposed to the sky-fairy , Noah's-Flood , angel-packing crowd .
Yeah , I 'd say you are wrong . It is n't easy to tell on these forums because we do n't have many topics about marriage in vegas .
oh cc , apparently , 10 % of the population has the power to destroy the other 90 % somehow . We ca n't be in the military because we have the power to undermine things , we ca n't get married cause we will destroy marriage for everyone , we can not possibly have committed relationships because it would make Britney look bad ( although , I have her beat by 4 years and counting , still happy and going ) We have the power . We are gay , ten percent taking out the other 90 % or so they say ( ask jaaman for more info )
Why ? You 'll just call them 'stupid ' . And by doing so you will have effectively trumped all of the facts in one fell swoop . Right ?
So true , and just like the mormon church . I plan on going to another protest at the Santa Monica pier tomorrow .
And a woman 's life choices , health , and finances are n't up for hi-jacking . Every time a lifer talks about demanding the nine month rape , they talk about what the baby deserves or not deserves and how it should n't be punished . This SCREAMS that you do n't value and respect women . The very idea that a woman is aborting as an act of revenge - it 's absurd and insulting .
Please do n't take offense ; it 's GOOD FAITH ADVICE . Do n't quit your day job .
So , all knowledge is ignorance , and all events not in the present are ignorance . I 'm not following you here . How about we leave the definitions as they are , so that we can differentate true from false ? Calling everything ignorance does n't move us forward in the debate . If we accepeted your claim , we are typing ignorance and concuding ignorance , so what would the point be ?
Actually no . My state does NOT protect gays and lesbians in matters regarding land ownership , employment or temporary shelter . ( Such as hotel and motel accomodations )
It does not matter what the document contains ! The same procedure should be done for every document . What the writing says is irrelevant to its authenticity ! You wrongly use Occam 's Razor as well . If the document is well preserved , has many copies , has copies relatively close to the original , etc , then the most likely assumption we can make is that the document itself is a valid source . Then and only then , should we examine the contents within and determine if they happened . We can do this through archaeological evidences and from other writings as well that agree with that one . Much of which we in fact do not have for many of Caesar 's expeditions , but yet again , we accept them as fact in our history books . But , it is funny that you should mention Caesar splitting a river . While he did n't do that , he did claim to have created a massive bridge in a very short time period and then destroyed it a few days later . Sounds like a pretty audacious claim from guys without any modern equipment . Should we discount this too because it 'does n't seem practical ' as we do with the bible despite the overwhelming documentation for it ? But here you are admitting that you set different standards 'depending on what the writing claims ' . Thanks again for proving my point I guess .
Well , a good start would be at http : //www.talkorigins.org And , what evidence do you have that the bible is the infallible word of God ? Other , than of course , unsubstantiated claims the bible makes .
** But here you blow it . No system , as a whole , is subservient , subordinate , inferior , or secondary to any or all of its parts . By simple definition a whole system is greater than , and superior to , any and all of its constituent parts .
Genesis 1:27 is a summary of Genesis 2:21-23
Maybe so , but a random sampling is far from a statistical fact of any kind . And remember , I am against any government intervention that makes it more difficult for law abiding people to own as many weapons as they choose to own . But I do feel we must be not only more responsible today , but vigilant in our desire to make sure that criminals , illegal aliens and terrorists are not able to procure weapons through legal channels . Especially since we already know they can procure them through so many illegal channels already . What I posted above was the type of regulations that I could live with even though I 'm sure that criminals would find a way to usurp them as they do most every safeguard that 's adopted .
Just wait until the CIA starts shipping crack again instead of smack , then the streets will regain their crimson splendor . Does this mean I can buy DU rounds now ?
Ok. By the way , you 're always whining about how I 'm calling you names , but then you do it back ?

Yes he was a pacifist . He had no choice . But he did want guns for Indian nationals .
What good is that when most cases involving firearms offenses never make it to the full court ? Anytime you have the potential to put somebody away for a great many years because they have a felony record and were arrested and in possession of a gun , the possession charges always get dropped and a plea deal is offered .
The fact that God wants all men to be saved does not support the idea of free will . Like I said before , you make your own decisions ... .but God has the ultimate authority and can `` veto '' your decisions if he wants . If you choose to rob a bank and God does n't prevent you from doing it ... did God force you to do it ? No . Now , as you said , God 's wish is that all men would be saved . Obiously if someone made the choice to be saved God would not intervene . Let me ask you a question if you believe man has complete free will to do whatever he wants . Do you think we could obliterate ourselves off the face of the earth tomorrow in a nuclear war -- and never fullfill the remainder of the phrophecies in the bible ? If we have ultimate free choice , then this would have to be possible . But if we were to do that , it would mean the prophecies in the Bible were not true -- which would make God imperfect , which would etc ... .
So we should n't treat people equally ? ? However Clive , we are talking about the Roe vs Wade case here.. I know they didnt have that in good ol ' GB . It was the case that in a sense legalized abortion . My claim is that the court case was illegal regardless of the outcome . Even if the ruling came the other way I would say it was illegal . They had something on CSPAN about this ... . ( NOTE : CSPAN ON SATURDAY AT 7PM WILL RE-AIR THE PROGRAM I AM TALKING ABOUT ) ... The asked about the constitution and how you look at it . Afterwards they took some calls that would answer the question `` do you support the courts making policy if you do n't agree with congress 's policy ? '' Someone from NEW YORK said that he supported the courts making policy if the congress make policy that he did n't agree with . This is what Breyer beleives too . THAT IS JUST ILLEGAL according to our constitution . How can you argue this ?
well , whatever works I suppose .
Except several rligious organizations around the country have financed , and gathered signatures to put anti gay marriage amendments on the ballot . They have a religious belief that marriage is between one man and one woman . They have turned this belief into law regaurdless of the religious beliefs of gay people . Any one who has voted yes to place these amendments into state constitutions because they have a religious belief that excludes gay people from marriage has also imposed those religious beliefs upon gay people . In short I have been barred from marrying the person I love because someone else , that I do not know and who does not know me , has some sick religious belief .
So then if I owned a business or a piece of property I could then refuse to sell or accommodate fundamentalist anti gay Christians and `` That it has been `` open to all for years '' carries no weight whatsoever . '' It is my property and I do n't like the immorality of fundamentalist anti gay Christians .
Confirmation records that you were a Christian ? Excuse me while I fall out of my chair in uncontrollable fits of laughter . Did your pastor make you sign a paper that said `` I , _________ , have proudly become a Christian on ________ __ , _____ '' ? Or did they take pictures of you talking to Jesus in the youth room ? Seriously though ... no , wait , nevermind . *snicker*
And yet , for most pro-choice folk on these forums , this question really is meaningless . For , even when it is assumed by these folk that the embryo has rights , they nevertheless argue that abortion is still acceptable . Even you believe this Shooter .
WND is not some guy on the internet who is 30 years old and has only had summer jobs on his resume .
The law does n't provide for that . It 's a pay as you go proposition . It 's actually even worse than some people think it is . It is not actually necessary to have actual intercourse to bring about pregnancy . But the DNA donor will still have to pay the piper . That 's the law .
Wow , a story about a sea monster . How ... ... .. original ... ... ...
actually , thats not logic , but its closely related . of course , if you stick your hand in fire it will get burned . logic dictates that the sum of initial energy must equal sum of final energy . etc etc you are very right that logic is predictable and constant . this is exactly why logic diametrically opposes god . a body of water can not divide itself and leave a dry path down the center unless god something to defy logical law . because gravity exists , its logical for water or any fluid to be drawn by gravity to the lowest level possible . there is nothing miraculous about the common and predictable properties of water under the force of gravity , so god isnt needed to explain it because logic already has if , however , that body of water behaves in a way that logic can not explain , then we can almost positively assume that such is the intervention of god . the only acts that can be accredited to god , in the bible , are those where something illogical occured
Oh dear . Do you actually know what a scientist means when they call something a `` theory '' ? Because it seems to me that you do not . The concept of gravity is `` only a theory '' , yet oddly enough I do n't see anyone trying to say that we should stop accepting the existence of the force of gravity because of this . The SCIENTIFIC theory of Evolution is a scientific theory that has been and continues to be extensively researched and developed . It should be taught in schools . Creationism ( or Intelligent Design ) is not a scientific theory , and is not supported by any evidence . If it must be allowed into schools at all it should be confined to the religious studies classroom , not the science laboratory .

To bring us back to the topic , I have some questions : In the first paragraph above , do n't you think that omnipresence might imply eternality at least if not omniscience ? In the second paragraph , just because something is beyond us , do you not think we can relate to it at least in a rudimentary fashion if not in a perfected ( complete ) fashion ? In the third paragraph , What leads you to believe that it would see us as an extension of the planet since we are indeed distinct and separate from the planet ( after all we are able to orbit the planet and even leave it all together ) ?

Well he HAS admitted he ca n't prove his belief . I guess that posting here would admit his false dichotomies that it 's either literal genesis or evolution are false and god knows the world will end when that happens . Super admitting he 's wrong ? Never going to happen .
This is what you do when they have no argument-insult . Let me fix up the thread title for you : `` There is absolutely no evidence of the theory of evolution that would convince me '' There , all fixed up for you .
No . Sarah Brady wants increased budgets for law enforcement and gun control on the same bill . Which is a slimly trick typical of dirty politicians and lawyers . That is the ammo use used to claim the NRA is against increased law enforcement budget . The NRA stands for increased budget only on one bill before Congress . Sarah Brady notions are irrational because she wants more that what is stated above . Please check `` no central database '' vs a database . Please check Sarah Brady 's 3 day waiting period + background check . I agree that rational laws are already on the books . I was merely re-enumerating them . How does Sarah Brady propose to reduce guns from the street ? Only two ways possible : 1 ) Gun buy back 2 ) Consfication . Please check the other threads regarding the astronomical cost of a gun buy back . Please check the Consitution for right of property ownership .

Oh , oh , and do n't forget to include the proposed Federal Kosher Amendment 's text , which just coincidentally matches the Levitical proscriptions , in your argument that things like the FMA have nothing to do with separation of church and state .
No it does n't . Changes in allele frequencies in a population over time were observed . That is an example of evolution . Evolution is n't something that is `` proved . '' It is observed . Populations of organisms change over time due to the changing frequiencies of genetic make up . That is observed . Evolutionary biology tries to explain the reasons for the observed evolution . In the case of the peppered moth , natural selection due to the predation of birds has been proposed .
Do n't count on it . The number of scientists in the American scientific community that subscribe to creationism is about % 5 , based upon a relatively recent poll . I will try to dig it up . Also , calling most Kansas residents stupid for voting in Christian Board of Education members is ridiculous . Religious views are almost never even mentioned in local politics . At the most , you see perhaps a flyer that says `` Vote ______ '' . The Christians who want to teach Intelligent Design in schools are an extreme minority that the media , in all its story-searching rating-mongering glory , is blowing out of proportion .
We do n't ignore it . We look at the circumstances-all these stories are from civilizations/groups that live on or near flood plains . Floods are common place . Catastrophic floods , not so much . You , however , must ignore things . For example ; where is the global layer of sediments which the flood would have had to have laid down ? Such a sediment layer would be quite thick , and uniformly found around the globe , and would consist of particles sorted by density . We would expect to find no signs of life within this layer ( no tracks or burrows , and no signs of growing plant life such as paleosols are tree roots ) . This sedimentary layer would show signs of being layed down in water . As well , any animal fossils ( plant too ) , would be indiscrimately mixed . We would expect , for example , to find trilobites alongside modern day rays , rabbits with velociraptors , etc . Now , can you point out where such a global layer exists Archie ? If it does n't , that pretty much debunks the flood `` theory '' . But you just ignore that do n't you ?
Partly because it is entirely dependent on one particular human being for its survival , after birth the baby can be looked after by pretty much anyone , before it is entirely reliant on one person , if that person dies , the feotus dies . I place value on the life of the feotus because it is close to human , it has the potential to become human . The closer any being is to being human the more value I tend to place on its life . I value monkeys more than I value cows , for example , I value cows more than I value mice , or rats . I would only kill cows for food , not for sport or because they were irritating . Mice I would kill or have killed if there was an infestation and I could n't get rid of them any other way , insects I 'm not too bothered about swatting if they annoy me . The feotus I consider to be close to human , closer than any other species and , whilst I consider it wrong to kill it , I can understand why others do n't and recognise that banning abortion also results in suffering and loss of life . It 's a difficult decision for me whether the loss of feotuses is balanced by the suffering prevented , lives saved and freedom promoted by keeping it legal .

Let me clear this up for you . Wasteful DEFENSE spending is the only reason we have trouble funding the `` war on terror . '' Which by the way has nothing to do with the $ 200b+ we have spent so far in Iraq ( which is by no means the war on terror ) . The entire budget of the EPA is only $ 7b ? I would have thought it was more than that . ( That would be 15 % of the increase in the defense budget from 2002 to 2003 according to this page : http : //www.csbaonline.org/4Publicati ... ense_Budge.htm Titled : 2003 Defense Budget Request : Large Increase in Funding , Few Changes to Plans
In which case you are thinking on a different tack to myself ; I 'm considering life in its entirety within time where reproduction is an essential characteristic . This point is quite valid considering your closing remark of
Never ? Not even when used by Richard Dawkins ? Talkorigins ? American Atheists ?
What a defeatist attitude you have .
Probably not . Very rarely do I run into a anti-abortionist who actually has a viable plan for decreasing what they protest . In fact some of the most ardent anti-abortion people I 've met are also some of the most ardent anti-comprehensive sexual education people as well . It 's like banning an action without trying to resolve why it happens in the first place .
First you assume that since I have liberal views on this subject , I agree with the actions of all other liberals , and second you assume that all other liberals commit the same actions . I have not once mentioned `` saturday night special . '' My laws are meant to target all gun crime and gun accidents . Should we not have laws against gun crime ( not laws against guns ) because most gun violence is minority on minority . Sould we not have murder laws because a disproportionate number of murders are commited by minorities ?
So if this entity is not born , does that mean it 's not a person ? Or does it become a person upon fertilization ? If so , why does that occurrence create value and dignity where none existed before ?

Oh please there is no me it does not say man and woman because it presumes that it IS a man and a woman . It doesnt say man and goldfish but I would never be able to marry my pet carp . There are plenty of couples with an equal chance of producing a handicapped child as an incestuous couple..they are still allowed to stay married . Marriage in ancient Rome really has no bearing on modern day marriage . Addison , I am not against gay marriages ... not because of gay rights or because Rome or ancient Greece allowed it . We in Britain have had gay marriages for a while and it has made no difference to anyone in Britain except gay people ... the sky hasnt fallen on top of us ... so why should I object ?
But is n't that the problem ? This creationist decided that science should be limited to his religion . He 's afraid of flying .
And like drugs , banning firearms would create another tax free black market , supplied by underground smuggling and manufacturing . Making a pistol with low chamber pressures , especially a semi or full auto firing from an open bolt , is no big deal to a competent machinist . Guns like the MC-10 are made mostly from stamped steel , simple to manufacture in a spare room . This all sounds like legislation of morality , proven to be impossible .
As a Biology teacher , I 'm trying to defend my subject against ignorant abuse . If you ask whether endless exchanges with the wilfully ignorant actually constitute effective defence , I 'll pass .
Just like the Brady Campaign . Often when trying to paint concealed carry holders as dangerous individuals , most instances they cite either never had a concealed carry permit to begin with , or the matters of the case were instances that lacked mens-rea and were n't crimes to begin with .

Yes , it 's very subjective . I was using evil as an example that was incorrectly used on the website . Even though evil is subjective , you can still be evil . ( you can do evil to take away your goodness , but the only way to make yourself colder is by removing your heat , not adding `` cold '' )
Nonsense , societies change over time , therefore they evolve . Only biological populations evolve through natural selection and the theory of evolution only applies to biological populations , but the term `` evolution '' applies to other things too .
Really ? Care to expound on that other natural explanation my christian brother ? Or do you really mean another version of the original natural explanation and you 're playing yet another game of semantics .
So ... why do we have any laws ? After all , criminals wo n't obey them anyway ...
You mentioned here that same-sex marriage may have benefits which outweigh its `` abnormal '' nature . I must point out that even if we consider it abnormal , there is no reason to suggest that abnormal is somehow bad . In a free and equal society , abnormal deserves all the rights and privleges thet normal receives . Any benefits that exist in allowing same-sex marriage are n't being weighed down by abnormality . [ quote ] The concept of equality is a lot easier to conceptualize than to put into practice . We , as a society , preach equality in principle , but practice inequality in all aspects of our lives . As I mentioned above , the tax code is a great example of institutionalized inequality . Businesses practice institutionalized inequality daily . For example , I am considered , by my employer , to be an HCI ( highly compensated individual ) . As a result , I pay a much higher rate for the same healthcare coverage that my fellow employees get . Is that fair ? I guess as I get older , I worry less about abstract concepts that sound good in theory but do n't exist in practice . [ quote ] Well , I wo n't argue that we will never be truly equal , and I wo n't argue that equality is the answer to everything , but I will argue that equality is worth striving for and that equality does exist in practice , it is just so ingrained into our mindset that we forget it is there . Compare US law to the laws of Europe before the revolution . In Europe there existed classes of nobles with extra rights under the law as well as kings and royalty with even more rights . As you went higher up in class , you 'd get more and more political power . In America , we all have one vote . We all have an equal ability to participate in government . It is true that we use that vote to choose someone to make decisions for us in the government , but our ability to participate in government set a new precedent in equality . Consider even slaves or women 's rights . These are cases where equality won out not just in theory but in practice . I will admit that we can not simply just make everyone equal in every way , but we do our best to give them equal rights and equal represenation . In the case of same-sex marriage , I can think of no reason why we should not extend the same rights that opposite-sex couples have to same-sex couples ( and plenty of reasons why we should ) .
well , whatever the case may be , that baby has a full function nervous system and can feel the pain whenever it is aborted . Does that not disturb you ? People always tend to think `` oh the mother is going to go through pain '' BLA BLA BLA.. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BABY THAT IS BEING TORTURED TO DEATH ? cmon .
You know Easy I almost laughed almost . Funny but I 'm already out of the womb and have been for oh.. 21 years 5 months 8 days 2 hours and 5 minutes . Pacific time of course . Oh and I love the voodoo little hocus pocus threat you made . I hear that Dove soap not only moisturizes skin , but also makes great for carving little voodoo figurines , kind of like whittling but with a kick . Just kind of pandering but is n't wishing ill will , or cursing someone like considered witchcraft and therefore a sin ? Guess your one of those `` Special '' Christians who pick from column A and insert into said column B . Boy wish I could change whats a sin and whats not for myself on the fly . Funny how those little frequent flier miles kick in after making so many `` donations '' to the collection box hmm ? Oh lordy lordy business is booming in the house of god ! !
Yes it does , by the definition of existence . We ca n't determine whether something exists or not if we do not define `` existence . '' I define it like this : If something exists , then it can be detected . If something can not be detected , then it does n't exist . Note that the converses are not necessarily true . Theists define `` God '' as something that can not be detected . Therefore , their god does not exist . Pantheists define `` God '' as the universe . Polytheists define their gods as superhumans who live on top of mountains . This proof can not disprove pantheism or polytheism , but it disproves theism .
... and he misses the point yet again ! Variation is passed down from parents to kids : people with different colored skin pass on their skin coloration , elephants without tusks have offspring without tusks , rats with a poison resistance pass on that resistance ...

Oh God , not again . You 're correct in the fact that the fossil record does n't prove evolution . Fossils , being the lithified remains of long dead organisms , have great problems providing any evidence on thier genetic make-up . What the fossil record does show is cases where , over time , modifications can be seen in animals morphology . There is also the fact you can find animals which are 'almost ' another type of animal . A good example is Synapsids ( otherwise known as 'Mammal-like reptiles ' ) . The fossil record provides data which is best explained by the ToE , rather than 'Goddidit ' . The argument between ToE and ID is not something in which the fossil record can be involved . As far as I can tell , you do n't talk about God as the personalised deity that most mainstream christian traditions talk about . In fact you seem to have a rather 'hippy-ish ' view in that God is an energy . Just so you know , the idea that humans die when seeing Gods goes back at least as far as the ancient Greeks . Zeus killed one of his lovers when she demanded to see him in his true form ( just by the power revealed in him ) . I think she was the mother of Perseus or something ... . Just so you know , if God is a force , we 've probably already picked him out and got him down as an unexplained physical constant , and if he 's a spirit , we ca n't pick him up scientifically , and therefore are n't trying to prove him or disprove him . It 's true that we are not hugely advanced in terms of our understanding , but we are hugely advanced beyond 5-600 years ago , when the christians were doing thier best to burn anyone who asked questions . Nowadays we agree that Gallileo was a very smart man , rather than a heretic . Religion still has a place today , but it no longer directs the entire course of human life .

Well , I certainly never used the word faith , but since you brought it up , what do you put your faith in ? What is it you believe in with no evidence ? Could it be science ? What is your evidence that science is true , except more science ? Scientific evidence which supports science is circular reasoning . It is no different than using the bible to support the bible . The bible is evidence for creationism , if you accept the bible as literally true . And there are many reasons ( mostly non-scientific ) to accept the bible as true . Every belief system is supported by pillars of belief , ultimately based on faith . Some of these belief systems have pillars that are short , and solid , and other systems are supported by pillars that are tall and spindly . Each of us intuits one or more pillars to be true , and our belief system follows . You have intuited science to be true , and the resulting belief system finds the bible to be based on faith . Others have intuited the bible to be true , and the resulting belief system finds science to be based on faith . I intuit that you each have it half right , combining faith and evidence to arrive at your belief system .
But Miller is with Jesus ( and by extension , you ) : he says that God exists and that Christianity is true . Or , if you insist that he 's against you , you 're left with this conundrum : You call Miller and theistic evolutionists incorrect , and he calls you and anti-evolutionists incorrect ; why is your position any more logical than his ? Regarding your citation about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts , you omit the remainder of the paragraph . Shame on you , marc , for your quote mine . Miller clearly continues with `` philosophical pronouncements '' that many atheists do not forward . Over the following three paragraphs , he examines a single philosophical insinuation -- not a plethora of them -- and then moves beyond `` atheistic philosophical pronouncements . ''
So its basicly an argument against those who wants to ban weapons without changing the constitution ?
Because specific species of horses only exist at certain periods in the geological record . Every so often , a new species that looks very , very similar , but with some distinct characteristics appears where the previous one use to in the geological record . Also , off the one of the coasts of either Ireland or England , there are sheer cliffs . In these cliffs you are able to see evolutionary development of shellfish for basically a billion years as you go from the top to the bottom .
So why did you say pot was worse than alcohol ? Just because both are apparently bad , does n't make one 'worse ' . I 'll point out that you compared the two first , so saying it 's dumb to compare the two 's shooting yourself in the foot .
Well , Satan was invented to explain why there is evil in the world.. the dualism . He was adopted by the Hebrews under the influence of Persia . However , in the Jewish religion , Satan is not this incredilbly evil being out to corrupt souls , but rather just an angel ( who had no free will ) , whose job it was to provide for bad choices so that people may choose GOOD , and thus live more sanctified lives by their own actions .
How about getting the government out of marriage entirely ? That is the goal of the libertarians , and maybe the liberals . No standards would be redefined if that happened , and gays would get their right to marry .

They can if they 're Catholics since Evolution is accepted doctrine now in the Church .
A no-brainer . Zayonara zygote !
Because there is evidence against Kerry . They proved him wrong about Cambodia , the atrocities that did n't occur , him throwing his medals away , etc . I have only seen 1 source to back up the Bush assumption that his girlfriend had an abortion . There is no evidence of medical records , the girlfriend coming out , any credible witnesses , etc . That 's why . Did you hear Kerry 's latest flip flop ? Two weeks ago , at an interview with ABC , Kerry said he wanted to move US troops out of Europe and the Korean peninsula . Then the other day , just 2 days after Bush said he wanted to move 12,000 troops out of Korea in the next 10 years , Kerry says that is n't what we need to do . Now , just 2 weeks after saying he wanted to remove troops from Korea , he changes his mind and says removing troops from Korea is a bad idea . Can you reasonably change your mind about something like that in 2 weeks ? Is he a pathological liar or does he just say the opposite of everything Bush says ?
Oh , okay , I understand it now . I still think it sounds quick but then again , I 'm not a member of the bird family .
Ok , I 'm going to have to question your statement as far as this post goes . I really do n't like the fact that you brought out , how African Americans , abort because of poverty , and low education . But white people abort for different reasons . That is basicly what you said . I find that to be an insult . My cousin , was not poor , nor was she uneducated when she had her abortions . As well as my sister . I think that is some kind of rasist idea that alot of people like to keep as regards to black people . Because I never saw you pin a reason , on why white people abort . But in your mind its understandable . But WOE ! To the uneducated black folks ! Then you go on to state that black people should in fact take advantage of the higher education , and sports provided for them . By that statement , it seems to me as if you 're implying that black people do n't take the oppurtunity to benefit ourselves . Need I remind you , that black people are leading in the sports world . And that there are thousands of black people who are taking advantage of higher learning . And what is your advice for those who are white , who lead uneducated lives , and abort because of being poor . Believe it or not , there are alot in that situation . So do n't you dare classify one race . And assume , they are uneducated , and poor . Thus they have abortions . Expecially since I see that with people of all races . It seems to me like you never took that into consideration .
Sport , if life-forms - including bacteria - are 'intelligent and dynamic ' , why does genetic engineering work ? Why do n't these 'intelligent and dynamic ' bacteria reject or ignore the foreign DNA and go on working as before ?
Wouldnt it be wonderful if every girl and every woman were valued enough to educate , to make sure that girls do not become pregnant before their bodies are ready for the traumatic event of pregnancy and chilldbirth ?
In that case , I 'm wondering why you did n't notice that it provided evidence for an aspect of evolutionary theory ... Basically , it provided evidence that a previous ad-hoc hypothesis was unnecessary to explain the development of hands and feet . I 'd summarize the rest of the article for you , but you ought to understand it already .
Then you would have to be believe that out of the supposed millions upon millions of people who walked the Earth none of them were pregnant and there were no newborns either . Then again , to be Christian , you also have to believe the world was created in 7 days and their was a Biblical great flood too . The best part about writing a fairytale is that the author gets to make up everything as they go along .
Once upon a time , a man killed another man with a tire iron . We 've simply got to ban tire irons ... and bats ... and hatchets ... and knives ... and scissors ... and sharp pencils ... and plastic bags ... and nail clippers .
Luckily science moves forward and these arguments from ignorance get left behind and the proponents of these arguments fade into history as proponents of ignorance trying to sell meaningless metaphysics . Junk DNA is a myth . Examples abound of research finding fascinating functions for these previously thought non-functional parts of the genome ( out of ignorance and bad metaphysics -- Dawkins : `` And there 's lots more DNA that does n't even deserve the name pseudogene . `` ) . Model unravels rules that govern how genes are switched on and off
Why is abortion bad ?
I believe you are misinterpreting Mr. Madison . James Madison made it clear throughout his writings that a powerful government was something to be worried about and carefully watched . But , lets say your right . Where do you draw the line ? For example : seeing as religion has most likely killed more people than cancer , under your theory , what is to stop government from outlawing organized religion ? You once told me you were studied in the ways of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young , would you be willing to give up your freedom of religion to protect other freedoms ?
Thank you for your reply .
So now your true colors finally show Archie . Now we see the mind numbing dogma that has been persecuting gays for years . And now that we have a voice , now that we have finally said enough to your radical incoherent mind numbing tirade of slanderous bull , you have obviously gone into a mode of severe mental meltdown . Comparing gays equal rights to slavery is as assnine as any thing you have said on this forum thus far . You saying that unless we were in bondage and were slaves you would REFUSE us equal rights of any kind ! Unless your forgeting it is people of your distinct odd calibur full of pointing blame , ridicule , and judging others when they dont have the backbone to judge themselves in the mirror and instead take their frustrations out on others and target them due to self weakness and loathing to incure a disgusting self satisfaction and glee in the suffering of others , that are the basis for all the injustices done to those who have been affected by the horror and torment of persecution due to belief or difference than others . Sorry everyone but this is just too much for me . The nerve of some people ! Have fun with God Archie Im sure when your at the pearly gates and when you stand before St Peter and hold out your hand expecting the riches of heaven and glory of your own dilussional self satisfaction , I hope he writes your name next to those of the pharascee 's and pulls the lever .
So you think Bush 's plan will involve increased government of dynamic proportions , and Kerry 's plan will not ? And you ask if I 'M watching the news ?
I 'm in a bit of a rush , so I 'll just cover this point . Er . . . they have , sort of . Prey animals , such as antelope , have eyes on the sides of their heads so as to spot approaching carnivores . This gives them a very wide field of vision . For example the pronghorn antelope has a field of vision of around 320 degrees . Smiley
I agree , but the libs would weep and call her a murderer . I suppose they 'd rather have her submit to this vile person . They support pacifism , and in New York , she 'd be in prison . Good thing people in my area have common sense .
That is what a straw purchaser gets . 10 years in a Federal Prision .
First of all , it 's not a precedent . this is the seventh or eighth state where a higher court has found anti-gay discrimination in marriage unconstitutional . Secondly , when so many rulings go in this direction , it can hardly be called `` lawlessness '' . It 's a call for lawful , constitutional interpretation of statutes . It takes extraordinary intellectual dishonesty to pretend there is some `` agenda '' at work . These decisions are the consequence of two things : our long history of rationally applying those silly words about equality that folks smarter than this generation of politicians put in the Constitution AND a long-term correction of the misunderstandings of what homosexuality IS and what its consequences are . I know you do n't personally believe it , but there is nothing wrong with us .
I 'm not exactly sure your point with this article . Was it merely to show that pro-choice groups exaggerate claims ? That they use emotional rhetoric to sway people to their side ? Trust me , you have told me nothing new . In fact , I am somewhat amused that you pointed this out , given that pro-life groups are guilty of all this and more . It said : Although the thought of finding a deceased young woman with a bloody coat hanger dangling between her legs is -- to say the least -- unpleasant , powerful and emotionally charged rhetoric does not a good argument make . I almost peed myself laughing when I read this . Whatever powerful , emotional images you believe pro-choice are guilty of , pro-life groups are many times worse . What is the mental image of a deceased young woman compared to the physical picture of bloody aborted fetus ' ? I have seen pro-life groups holding huge posters outside high-schools , and pro-life groups hold them up in front of clinics . How much do you want to bet that the fellow here would defend one while attacking the other ? The article speaks of fallacies yet fails to mention the statement of `` abortion is wrong because it 's murder ! '' that pro-life people seem very fond of . This is the exact fallacy the article mentions , using an unproven point ( abortion is murder ) to hold up an unproven point ( abortion is wrong ) . I point this out not to absolve pro-choice groups of guilt , but to say : Before pointing fingers , make sure your own house is in order . This entire article is also something of a strawman argument as well . The argument that illegal abortions will almost inevitably occur if abortion is banned is not a justification for legal abortions ( per se ) . As I see it , since illegal abortions will almost inevitably occur if abortions are banned , the complaint is that pro-life people would rather see more women hurt ( and yes , more women are hurt with illegal abortion than legal ) than actually solve the problems with society . To ban abortion and declare the problem solved is extremely irresponsible and does nothing to help society or women . If you would , chloe , please link to the study the article mentions about the number of illegal abortions ? Im amazed they managed to eek out numbers , given that not even the CDC has exact figures since illegal abortions were not tracked . The most compelling evidence Ive seen looked at the birth rates for various ethnic groups the years previous to abortion being legal to the years after , corrected for various factors such as better birth control methods . They found little change in the birth rates , indicating the number of abortions most likely did not increase or decrease . Yes , I know pro-choice groups mislead with stats and figures . This is nothing new , but I feel it is dishonest to point this out without acknowledging your own groups shortcomings in the same area .
Sorry , but I have to say this . Who the hell gives a flaming turd what Freud thought ? He was a coke head quack who pulled a bunch of bunk out of his butt and called it psychotherapy . ..
I think there 's a few points to be made here - 1 ) This is a forum specifically for the purpose of discussing God and religion . Thousands , hundred 's of thousands , maybe even billions of people who do n't believe in God have n't bothered to seek it out , they have no interest , it attracts those that do have an interest in learning how and why others think and do as they do . 2 ) Discussing something , no matter what the reason or how much it is discussed , does not lend any validity to what is being discussed . There is an infinite number of examples I could give to illustrate that point . Take in a sci-fi convention some time as a prime example . 3 ) I do n't see so much the discussion of `` is there a God/is n't there a God '' , as I do the discussion of religion and the Bible . That is a very important distinction . Religion is very real , and affects all of us , whether we are believers in it or not . Whether or not Bigfoot exists , or the Klingons are invading someone , has no bearing whatsoever on my life or reality , religion does . I think that is the reason you see such fervent discussion and rejection of Christianity on forums like this . Why the large outcry ? Those in the minority always tend to be more vocal , they have to be , or they 'd simply be overwhelmed by the `` silent '' majority . Waxy P.S . Do n't sell yourself short , you more than hold your own on these forums .

IOW , you do n't have a clue . The usual nothing just a WAG . I am surprised NATO bit on a line like that ? Perhaps he thought you actually knew something
The sources state that Jerome declared three books to be apocryphal , and his correspondence includes replies to claims that his rejection of those books was political . If he was n't involved in the selection why would he write that ? If I wanted a justification for disbelief I 'd quote Galileo , it 's much easier . This is mainly about leveling the playing field with SoC , had he bothered to reply .

Never had to think of it as my followers are universally incapable of independant thought to begin with . 'Cause I 's a smart god to make them that way ... Or I simply recruit from the GOP .
So do you think that the earth is hundreds of millions of years old ?
All else you said has been rehashed in other threads and you know my view . I want to comment on this . No , I said all the reasonable people . I do not believe all pro-choice people are reasonable , or even the majority of them ( in America at least ) . But I do know that the pro-choice position ( as I interpret it , at least ) is more reasonable than any pro-life position . Am I an egomaniac or what ? And no , I do not believe `` pro-choice people '' ( speaking in terms of politics ) would work toward the goal of making it rare . I firmly believe that it will only happen with a massive re-ordering of our society , respecting what women and mothers go through in all aspects of life . I do n't think that will happen no matter if abortion is legal or illegal . I firmly believe that abortion is a symptom of ills with society and society 's view of women throughout the ages , and the fact that women have not been able to 100 % control if they become pregnant . The only reason it is out of the shadows , so to speak , is that we have the technology to have safe and effective abortions . Making abortion illegal will not make it go away and will only add insult to injury by violating women 's rights . As I 've said , abortion will not be rarer because of litigation no matter if `` pro-life people '' or `` pro-choice people '' have their way . Women themselves need to be supported and respected in order for that to happen . Making abortion illegal will not curb abortions , it violates rights and shows extreme disrespect to women . Keeping abortion legal may not curb them itself ( only the personal views of women will do that ) , but it shows respect for women and their choices and it does not violate women 's rights either . I believe keeping abortion legal is the first step to reducing their numbers , but it is only a step . I do doubt that Americans have the energy to actually change our society to the point I believe is necessary . However , one step is better than pushing their heads back under the water as pro-life people advocate .
That 's rich from someone who does n't understand erosion .
Whoooeeee ! ! That is almost certain to cost him ( 4 ) four votes .
Usually , but most of this has been quoted out of context by creationists and answered so often that it is an old story . Besides , as I mentioned , Feduccia has just published a detailed study on the embryology of bird digits . It supports his view , of course . I do n't have a problem with that and it is certainly an issue worth study . My days of ornithology and embryology were long ago . Also , since those papers were published there have been several more feathered dinosaurs and primative birds discovered . Things are moving fast right now . Jeff Polling also has some information about the Ruben et al . article . But the `` bird hip/lizard hip '' bit is pure nonsense that demonstrates profound ignorance or intentional deceit . The correct information is so easy to find . That sort of conduct certainly casts a bad light on creationism .
I think this is unlikely under the current makeup of the Supreme Court . But that of course is the fear that many have , i.e. , that gay marriage would be imposed via judicial fiat ( whether at the state or federal level ) rather than through legislative means .
I 've noticed . It 's like walking into a rock fight between two of your best friends , and getting tore up . It saddens me to see such brilliant people ignore or supress one of the most beautiful parts of being a human .
Or having the gun emboldens one to go places one would n't unarmed , or catching sight of the bulge under your coat or the weapon itself makes the bad guys shoot or ? It 's fine with me if you 'd take your chances but the numbers do n't seem to support the wisdom of it .
I think you 're right , but prisoners usually marry women , do n't they ?
Again , a perspective problem . I do believe that man would not be here to govern without God , so our argument goes deeper into a realm where I would have to convince you that there is a God , or you would have to convince me that there is no God . I really do n't think we are going to get anywhere from this angle . Just too many differences in beliefs .
Actually it 's a Republic . Shall we put your marriage to the vote ?
So there 's the typical creationist claim that , `` if you do n't believe as I do , then you are trying to escape the punishment of my petty god . '' How bizzare that you claim that science has something to do with how one wants to live his life , while ID creationism and creationism are somehow based on evidence . So , why not present the evidence that ID creationism has any logical or empirical support . Show me the evidence .
Oh , and keep your lie - I mean , explanation - consistent with your entire post !
I would like him to provide evidence in support of his repeated claim that posters here have frequently said `` that honest citizens will commit crimes if given guns . ''
Actually , none of those are predictions that creationism makes , and what 's more , they 're all disprovable . Biochemists estimate we 're within ten years of creating life from non life . Prepared to chew on that foot ? The logical leap you 're making here is that if we assume creationism is true , evolution and abiogenesis must be false , and that 's silly . It 's actually possible for all three to be true . God could have the ability to create life , but perhaps God never did so and allowed life to arise through natural processes . Moreover , suppose God created the first life and allowed it to evolve from that . None of these possibilities are inherently contradictory to anything but a specific reading of a specific holy book .
Actually no , when laws are made based on one specific concept of one paticular faith system , if FORCES all CITIZENS to live by that faith .
Really no more amazing how science can cure some diseases , smash the atom , create nuclear explosions , yet screw up many other things that it attempts to do , often at great expense to the general public . Global warming hysteria comes to mind .
I live in NH and I can truly say it is a great place to be ! !
As metioned in a post above mine , these verses prove nothing , and they certainly do not suggest creationism .
Because of the history of it . Well , ID is actually identical to 'scientific creationism ' , but spruced up with more scientific terminology to attempt to pass 'seperation of church and state ' . Let 's just say that I.D . is an attempt to teach Creationism in school .
You mean like you try to spin things to try to give REPUBLICANS the benefit of a doubt on gay rights issues where none is deserved ? It 's interesting where you chose to cut-and-paste the article . The VERY NEXT STATEMENT includes `` the other side of the story '' Justice Department officials say they are obligated to defend federal statutes when they are challenged.Obama admin : dismiss gay couple benefits lawsuit | U.S. | Reuters Obama has already put himself on record on his stance on DOMA by VOTING AGAINST it . HE PERSONALLY supports its repeal . But HE PERSONALLY is not `` the justice department '' . If a bill is made into law , elected officials ca n't pick and choose how to do their job and take their personal considerations into account in enforcement . I object to people taking it upon themselves to ignore the law when they are county clerks asked to perform gay marriage in areas where it is legal . When the courts ruled that Gavin Newsome 's gay marriages were illegal and not binding , that was the proper ruling there too . When it comes to the justice department , it is their job to argue for the existing law . Period . I do n't know why that is so difficult for some . I do n't know why some pretend a refusal to violate their job position is somehow a demonstration of unmitigated support for what their job requires them to do .
You need help pal . joke or not you need help .
The article continues to comment that this mechanism serves as a mechanism tailored for evolution ? Irrespective of its origins , somehow , life utilizes evolution FOR evolution . B. Convergence As seen in the docking simulation , the solutions all converge on relatively similar local optima . Examples of molecular and structural convergence are abundant in nature . Also , abiogenesis spectacularly converged into a reasonably optimized genetic code ( with a few derivatives ) and life 's memetic algorithms . Convergence in virtual simulations and in nature thus serve to point to similarities between them . C ) The Biased Nature of Evolution . D ) The Biased Nature of Evolution . After running the docking simulations , the software seemed to have been biased towards a few local optima even after random variation processes . The parallels between development has already been highlighted above . Parallels between development and evolution also exist . Compare the developmental program to evolution . Evolution also seems to be biased towards a few endpoints : Peer-reviewed article : An End to Endless Forms : Epistasis , Phenotype Distribution Bias , and Nonuniform Evolution It is argued to be as a result of genetic instructions dating earlier in evolutionary time . ( Preadaptations ) . To conclude , parallels exist between our own designed docking simulations employing memetic algorithms and the evolution of life . These include ( Figure 1 ) : 1 ) Memetic algoritms 2 ) Convergence 3 ) Biased to a few endpoints 4 ) Local optima ( optimal biomolecular machines ) http : //mybroadband.co.za/vb/picture ... .pictureid=1885 Figure 1 : Similarities between evolution and a docking simulation .

No she did n't .
First of all , why would you take humans out of consideration ? Does n't the verse I posted above show where in addition to God blessing Adam and Eve in marriage , it speaks of God giving humanity dominion over every creature on Earth which humanities personal history is evidence of actually happening ? So since we are made in Gods image : Gen 1:26 Then God said , `` Let Us make man in Our image , according to Our likeness ; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth , and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth . `` And notice how here , as He decides to create us in His image , He repeats Himself by giving us the same authority over all living things as He did when He blessed Adam and Eve and commanded them to be fruitful and multiply 2 verses later at Genesis 1:28 ? So just because homosexuality is found in the animal kingdom , who also never sinned against God and fell from grace by the way , it 's irrational to compare animals sexual habits to Mans as we are made in Gods image and live by different morals and values than animals do . And btw , welcome to the forum .
Ditto ! With that in mind ... I want to let you make your own arguments for your position before I post a rebuttal to any of them , for reasons described above . Instead , though , I can post a brief few arguments of my own . Firstly : the statement you are trying to support is `` Biologically speaking , a human individual 's life begins at conception '' . However , the word 'life ' - that which you are arguing has a factually determinable beginning , does not have an absolute biological definition . To quote the wikipedia article on it : `` It is still a challenge for scientists and philosophers to define life in unequivocal terms '' . This is doubly the case when considering the 'life ' of an individual , as opposed to the 'life ' of , say , a skin cell . For example , a person with no brain activity can be composed of living cells if they are kept on life support , but legally and medically the individual is considered dead . The argument , then : If 'life ' has no definitive definition , how can you argue that it has a clearly definable start ? Secondly : Consider a zygote . According to you , it is an individual . But a zygote can split into two - to form monozygotic , or 'identical ' , twins . Before splitting , it is one 'individual ' . Afterwards , it is two . Where has the extra individual come from ? Given that the split can happen up to 15 days after fertilisation , when was the start of that individuals life ? Thirdly : In contrast to identical twins , consider a chimera organism . A chimera is made up of cells containing one of two different strands of human DNA - they are formed when two fertilised eggs or early embryos collide and become one embryo , which then goes on to be a single human being . Given that the single individual was created by the merging of two different individuals ( by your definition ) , when was the biological start of their life ?
Oh goody . Some more of your well informed opinion based on wishful thinking , no research and even less actual thought . Probably the bird you are talking about is the Cormorant ( Nannopterum harrisi ) . Yes , it is flightless because it has no need to fly . There were no natural preditors in the Galapagos and the bird is a sea bird . It swims and eats fish . It 's wings are much reduced because it swims by kicking rather than by `` flying '' through the water like a penguin . Like the penguin it is a diving bird .
30 million Russian citizens killed . 5-12 million German citizens ( depending on the source you read ) along with 6 million Jewish people killed . An estimated 100 million Chinese citizens killed . 20 million Africans killed in various countries in Africa . 2 million Cambodians slaughtered . This is just the first 5 off the top of my head that occured in the world during the 20th Century . All occured after sweeping gun control took place and forced disarmament of citizens . In America , every state that has enacted restrictive gun control has seen an increase in crime , police brutality , questionable law enforcement practices such as violations of 4th amendment rights and so on . Washington DC enacted a total handgun ban in 1976 , if you look at the crime rate reports from the years before and the years after that took effect , the truth is very telling . In Britain and Australia , both nations enacted sweeping gun bans and forced confiscation . The crime rates of both nations has skyrocketed . Violent crime has especially increased in both countries as criminals realize they have little to fear from their victims now . Reports of police brutality in both nations is on the rise . A consequence of the gun ban in Britain is the repeal of their guarantee of a quick and fair trial . This bit of legislation basically allows a suspect to be held indefinitely without a trial or even being notified of the crimes he or she is accused of . For a very telling reason against gun control , I recommend you watch the UN Gun Debate between Rebecca Peters and Wayne LaPierre . Then , examine the international poll results online from the debate . Gun control kills . History has proven this over and over again . I know that some gun control advocates have the best of intentions at heart but what they fail to realize is that by opening that door , they allow those with less than the best intentions to take advantage of the situation . This is exactly what Hitler did in 1938 . He took advantage of the 1935 gun control act of Germany . He used it to find his enemies and eliminate them . Is over 150 million victims of gun control reason enough for you ? It is for me . Mike
Correction : hardly any of them . This is just another lame attempt to use the `` guilt by association '' BS .
Well then just rescind the OP and we can discuss this within those parameters ( which you have unfortunately already dismissed in your conversation with JP in 31 ; `` This is an endeavor not of a voluntary nature but an effort to fix a crumbling system that is bankrupting and jeopardizing the health and well being of a majority of Americans . '' )
Look what is talking about insane , immune to reason , a prisnor of his own giant ignorance , slavery fetishist and one of the comic relief 3 stooges . You might have a dialogue but then insult is n't part of one . No one gives a rat 's patoot about your opinion . If it were your country maybe they would but I doubt it . Mean while eat your heart out as you rail in fear about us buying and keeping arms .
Nope .
Well , well , well , Samantha Lee and Rebecca Peters rolled up all in one . Who is to blame ? The citizenry and the Constitution or one man , a politician of the elite ? One of your own . If he did it ? What about the Yale student who wrote the definitive book on self-defense that agrees with your line of babble ? We can place the blame at your doorstep then ca n't we ? Why I just imagine you are mad enough to kill ! ! We warn repeatedly that you can not put your faith nor your life in jeapardy for a meaningless piece of paper . You getting the message yet ? The police have no duty to protect you , you are on your own .
Well , maybe if you had taken the time to read through the previous posts you 'd see my response . But I 'll answer it again for your sake .
Well , I guess you can refuse to see something that 's pretty obvious . It 's up to you .
Because they let the GSA act like any other club with the same amount of rights and lack of adminstration interference ?
Good , we both agree then that the issue of legality concerning elective abortions is a little more complex than just the simple matter of a persons right to make a `` choice . ''
My great , great , great grandfather dug a hole when he was 15 . He put a time capsule in that hole . After years of erosion , I come across it at the same time a dead bug is found near it . According to you , they are both the same age since they were both found on top of the ground . Do you agree with this or do you disagree ? once again , you are assuming erosion when that may or may not have happened . Your contention that all fossils found on the surface got there by way of erosion is nothing but speculation . So how exactly does cement-like rock get removed from fossils ?
You are n't serious are you ? ? ? Is this a joke ? You 're one of the most active attackers of Christianity in these threads . Are n't you the one that likes to use the term `` Christonazi ? ''
But he does know humans before they are born .
Well some of us at least tried to get you to learn more . But I seriously doubt that you would be banned for not having a biology degree , I rather suspect other factors came into play . Certainly I never have complained to any moderators about your posts . I rather suspect nobody has , indeed I rather suspect you catalyzed any banning yourself , but I do not see how since you are rather mild mannered ( but more verbal ) than the average creo .
`` Before time '' ? Does that phrase have any meanng ? That is sort of like saying something is north of the north pole . It is symantically meaningless .
What about all the ova that were n't fertilized ? ! Just wasted , completely wasted and forgotten ! THE HUMANITY ! OH GOD ! ! !
But you said that they happen at the same time , then you contradict yourself . Make up your mind . And high pressure systems can prevent expansion while raising temperature .
So , who 's being deceptive and misleading , disguising propaganda as current `` news ? '' Well of course it 's CNN and Brady , what else is new ?
But , Michele , it was n't any where near to killing her . The stipulation of the law , TO SAVE THE LIFE OF THE MOTHER ONLY ! ! ! Otherwise , the pweshious widdo fetus has all priority .
Wow ! Supersport got something right !
Well , I am a creationist , and I would hope I can think logically ( it 's generally a good quality for an accountant and tax attorney to have ) . The difference between microevolution and evolution as an explanation for the beginning of a species is simple . In microevolution a species is simply adapting to it 's environments . In evolution as is usually meant by the word you are talking about the formation of an entirely new creature from inorganic compounds . If this is possible I pose a few questions for you . 1 ) Why have no new creatures evolved from inorganic compounds in human memory ? 2 ) How did these inorganic compounds decide that some creatures should evolve , while others of the same species did not ? Why are there not some apes that have evolved into humans by now ? Why did n't all apes evolve into humans ? 3 ) One of my favorite pieces of confusion from evolutionists involve fossils . How do you know how old a fossil is ? Every evolutionist I have asked has stated that fossils are dated by the rock layer they are found in , but if you then ask them how the rock layer is dated they answer that it is dated by the fossils that where discovered in it ! That 's a classical example of circular reasoning . I am not a scientist , so I can not present all the evidence against evolution as clearly as someone with a scientific education and background might do . If you are truly interested in learning more about the creationist arguments against evolution you can check out the article located at http : //www.answersingenesis.org/docs2004/1106ng.asp . This article also has many links to other articles with even more information .
And unfortunately gun control does not mean that the criminals can not get their weapons . They have been either making their own , stealing them from homes or even the police , or importing them in with their drugs . Gun blitz launched
I see what she was saying now . When she said it it sounded like the man had no opinion at all .
first of all , the claim is that random changes in molecules do not produce bodiliy structures . Proteins are molecules and are thus not what I was referring to . Second , there are no new enzymes or new proteins produced by any mutations ... and not only that but none of those mutations have been shown to be random . So for all the billions of bodily structures in the world , ToE can not account for even ONE of them .
So are you saying that if one person prays for another person who is sick , that if the praying person believes enough then some power of belief within him is great enough to heal another person who has no such beliefs , but that is n't a miracle that can be attributed to God , but is just something the person praying accomplished because they believed enough ? So when I laid hands on my 9 month old daughter and prayed for her healing in Jesus name , when she then within 5 seconds opened her eyes and went from completely listless with a 103 degree temp to wide awake , happy and affectionate as she smiled at me with bright little eyes , are you saying that something within me transfered to her to bring about that instant result ? If that is true , then you must admit that something supernatural still happened , it 's just that the power to heal transfered from me instead of from God whom I asked to heal her in Jesus name . Now mind you , I totally reject that , as I know it was God healing my daughter because I know rationally speaking , that I have no supernatural powers within me . And I truly understand how difficult it is for someone who has never personally experienced a miracle to not be skeptical about miracles or the supernatural , and maybe if I had experienced only one in my life then I too might question if it really happened . But I have had numerous Angelic interventions that can not be denied . And the personal spirit filled contacts with my heavenly Father on a daily basis is more than one such as I am can even fully appreciate or comprehend . Because you see , I am a sinner and completely unworthy to be in Gods presence at all , yet He has lived within me and fellowshipped with me each and every day of my life since I accepted Jesus as my Savior in August of 1975 . And if you want to believe me , 2 of the Angelic interventions I experienced happened before I was even saved in August of 75 . So as it is written , before the foundation of the World , God Knew me . And while I was yet in the womb , He knew me . And while I was in the womb , He knew the number of hairs on my head . So also , even before I accepted Jesus and was born again , my Father in Heaven knew me , loved me and protected me until the day of my salvation . This is why I 'm so adamant and stubborn in my belief and can not be moved by any unbelief . If I denied Jesus and Gods truth with all of the personal and first hand supernatural experiences I have had , I would be less worthy than the greatest evil doer and unbeliever in the world to receive Gods Grace and Love as I have . I have prophesied , spoken in the language of the Angels , been supernaturally saved from drowning , been saved from a violent attack which may have led to my murder as I had 5000 in cash on me at the time . But my Guardian Angel intervened and ran the muggers off and they never found the money . That was just one of the interventions and all I did when i saw the trouble coming was say within my mind , `` Lord Jesus , help me '' . Nothing I did stopped the attack , nor could it have as these people had murder in their eyes . I had never seen such cold blooded hatred in any persons eyes before as was in this one guy . And yet within seconds I saw that rage in his eyes turn to abject terror as he looked past me , then he said to me , the next time I 'll kill you and they ran away like total cowards . When I turned around to see who had scared them so much and looked exactly where they looked when they looked over my shoulder , you know what i saw ? Absolutely nothing . There was nobody there at all , no human anyway .
What are you talking about ? I 'm serious . Coffee was f-ing me up in a bad way .
And yet you could care less if a Gay teen blows his brains out ... ..
It seems to be the reason for crafting this new , individual right against the States . Since the original purpose of the Second Amendment does n't appear to be needed , there is a new use that is protected .
`` Ready to go '' , in the sense that living things are equipped with a means of making small errors which are used by natural selection to make new structures . Barbarian , regarding mutations : There is a lot of that . Many mutations are recessive and a population over time accumulates a lot of genetic variation that can become useful if the environment changes . The founder population of lizards , for example , could have had at most , 20 alleles for any gene locus , since each lizard can only have 2 . The new ones evolved by mutation . Sometimes , we can even observe that happening , or trace the mutation back to a known ancestor . Would you like to learn about it ? .
Good news . It seems as time goes on Arizona attempts to become more and more intolerant and bigoted . Thankfully he put an end to this one ( too bad not the immigration one ) .
The words `` reality '' and `` have to '' should never have been added to that sentence . The reality is , bats could have evolved echolocation as a navigating tool , and learned to apply it to hunting and communication later . After all , all three uses require the same `` hardware '' : an organ to generate the sonar , and an organ to receive it .
what the `` eff '' are you talking about ? ! wrong thread buddy .
Yet , consistently , when asked to justify your position , you , and others , have seen fit to use locker rooms as justification . If all these bad analogies are not justification , then what is your justifcation ? Please tell us , since I obviously chose the wrong response of yours . This is n't some hypothetical issue . We 're talking about human rights , people , living breathing adults with families , friends , looking forward to a new year , where ... ..where people like you BLINDLY declare them sinners , immoral , partaking in evil , and ultimately , not allowed to form legal parternships the same why hetero couples are based on ... ..based on ... .based on ... ... On what ? Your desire to oppress the minority ? Your desire to push your specific religion onto other people ? What ?

That 's quite a leap , even for you . How did you know that the officiers were pro-life ? Or that any pro-life people would condone the officiers ' behavior in this instance . I certainly think it was excessive . I guess I must not be pro-life by your illogic .
Ignorant or dishonest . Who ever claimed that they were ?
Yes you are .
Well , no , as evolution is not a random process , but then you would n't know that would you ?
But it is based on history . There is plenty of history showing that women had illegal abortions . Or , if their families had money . went to Costa Rica or Britain to have a legal one in those countries . Women died or had severe medical emergencies due to illegal abortions . Doctors and nurses were prosecuted for providing these services .
Again , your argument does n't make good sense . First you say a fetus has no chance against someone who wants to kill it . I agree with this . Then you say a child has a chance against someone who wants to kill it ... and you base this on the killer 's changing his mind because the baby 's crying . Where DID you go to school ? Have n't you heard of the many shaken-baby-syndrome deaths that occurred because some idiotic person in custody of the child got fed up with the baby 's crying ? It just would n't stop crying , so they killed it . Until a child gets old enough , smart enough and strong enough to outrun or hide from someone trying to kil them , they have no chance of survival . Your argument is all wet . We are separated by reasoning and compassion from the other animals . Theirs is a life based on instinct and a few learned behaviors . For every example you can give me of animals protecting their own young , I can likely present an example where the males ( sometimes the females ) will kill the young of their species just to keep down the competition . A domestic bitch , when presented with a weakling in a litter of pups , will eat the weakling .
I see the similarity with the original scripture , in which Jesus was recognizing the authority of both God and Caesar in the world . However , Jesus was talking about the political power in the world . Jesus called the academics of his day , vipers and hypocrits , because they pretended to be holy but were evil . He called the wisest of men fools , because they did not believe in God . Also , as I stated before , truth should be the ultimate goal . I do not fear science . I do not see any truth that science may happen to reveal as a threat to faith . Why ? Because God is Truth . Jesus said , `` And the truth shall set you free '' ! ! !
But did n't understand them .
Really Brady . It is widely recognized that Mr. Heston gave away a very promising film career in order to take such an unpopular stand at that time . In fact he worked very little in films after that . I think the above statement was a political one , an anti-gun one , without much fact to back it up . I do n't think a man of such principle changes his mind when all he actually work to accomplish comes to pass . But you can push your poison just as far as you want to . You have a first Amendment right to do so . Mr. Heston would have wanted it that way !
And how can Creationists be so ignorant as to allege scientific theories are beyond questioning , when it 's actually their belief in their bible that they refuse to question ? Who would believe the nonsensical fables of nomadic sheepherders ?
I got a chuckle out of this . It 's a blatant lie and you know it . Stir , stir , stir . Good thing you know who is n't around to tear you a new one . Waxy
By gay bias do you mean disagrees with your opinion ?
I made no such equivalent criticism - which would have been along the lines of 'There may well be no designer , which would rule out design ' . I do n't want or need to invoke unknowable unknowns to criticise ID . You 're speculating about just such a thing , the likelihood of which is unquantifiable , whereas we know that patterns arise in nature in the absence of design . Moreover , you 're hypothesising a natural bias that prevents the most fit variants from proliferating - but that very bias would disqualify them as 'most fit ' and make something else 'most fit ' instead .
Just as you and your favorite group are master manipulators of emotion amongst the uneducated . Yes we do need to pay attention to the great danger you and your ilk pose . We need to shine the light of truth on your lies and expose them .
Could you be so kind as to point out the holes , please ? Or are you going to dance around some more ?
Ahh more one line opinionary ... . Liberty is when the government fears its people , Tyranny is when the people fear its government . Your blanket statment is noted but as you like to say `` it does not hold much water '' , when you do n't follow up with any logic for your statments ...
Are you referring to the Epicurians ? Aristotle ? I ca n't think of any reference to these people as atheists . Socrates was accused of being an atheist , and the accusation made it clear this was because he did n't believe in the gods . Some schools of Hinduism have been atheistic from BC , and Buddhism ( founded before 400 BC ) is essentially atheistic , in that there are 'gods ' but they are considered limited and not given much importance . More generally , I think modern atheists and fundamentalists are both largely the result of 1 ) the breakdown in everyone conforming to one religion , probably starting at the Reformation 2 ) the scientific outlook making people mistake religious meaning for scientific meaning , causing them to either think the Bible must be scientifically true because it 's religiously meaningful , or that it must be religiously meaningless because it 's scientifically false . Richard Dawkins and the average creationist make the same fundamental mistake - the greeks would say they mistook 'muthos ' ( myth , allegory ) for 'logos ' ( reason , science )
Thanks for this totally un-predictable response .
Just a couple points of clarification ... o It may grow into post-birth human person . It may not . o It can already be considered a human child before birth by commonly accepted definitions of the word 'child . '
And you 're ignorant . Polgomy is a astronomical rights abuser .
Well its your view so you tell us . Its not the view of pro-choice supporters . So lets put your convictions to the test . Would you support the SCHIPs program just vetoed by our pro-life president ? How much of a tax increase would you personally be willing to take on for the purposes of paying woment NOT to abort their fetus ? Would you find $ 2000 per year too much ? $ 1000 , $ 500 ? Would you favor an additional 0.50 per gallon tax on gasoline to do the job ? Would you be willing to accept $ 1.00 per pack of cigarettes ? And would you support a welfare program for poor single mothers so that they can take care of their child after you pay them not to abort ? Or does your concern for that fetus stop at birth ? Pro-life till birth ?
Ah , now I am the ignorant one or I am lying ? ! There is no way in heck I would be eligible for Medicare - first off , I am well below 65 years old , and second off , I am not disabled , I do not have end-stage renal disease , nor do I have any sort of other thing that would apply . As to Medicaid , we have actually attempted to look into it , but as we are above the `` poverty level '' locally , along with several other factors ( which are frankly none of your dang business ) , we are not eligible for Medicaid either . So you can insult me or call me a liar all you want - your views of a perfect little world where every woman will be taken care of are just not reality .
Just because it doesn´t make it into press doesn´t mean that normal self-defense doesn´t occur and is illegal .
United States v. Verdugo-Urquirdez , 110 S. Ct. 3039 ( 1990 ) . This case involved the meaning of the term `` the people '' in the Fourth Amendment . The Court unanimously held that the term `` the people '' in the Second Amendment had the same meaning as in the Preamble to the Constitution and in the First , Fourth and Ninth Amendments , i.e. , that `` the people '' means at least all citizens and legal aliens while in the United States . http : //www.tsra.com/2ndamend.htm

Why even set this in sci-fi ? We 've got heaps of religions on the known world . Here 's one for you ... say a number of people entered a debate forum with the purpose of defending 'evolution ' which follows 'scientific method ' . They dispute religion because they say , 'if religion is true , ... .which one ? ' . Then someone shows them that evolution is not an homogenous theory ; not only are there different modes of theories of evolution ; materialism , ID-theory , etc , but even within their version ( materialism ) there 's different conflicting theories , some of which are mutually exclusive . Further to that , many of their notions about science are n't scientific , but based on philosophies of science ; such as their false belief that there 's only one 'scientific method ' , or that materialism , itself , is the only method of evolutionary theory . And to top it all off , science ca n't actually determine what is true , anyway . So they 're arguing against a belief in certainty from a belief in uncertainty . They deride people 's beliefs in God , etc , as being irrational , or illogical , but do n't even realise the faulty basis of their own assumptions about evolutionary science . How do they react to this revelation ? I would guess that there would be howls of protests , lots of ad hominems etc . This of course does n't disprove 'evolution ' , but they do n't even look to that , they 're too busy attacking someone who 'd dare question their a priori notions about science . That is , in this 'hypothetic forum ' I 'm talking about
You advocate choice to one out of two parties involved in a pregnancy ... .let us be clear that you are telling the person of rape that they had no choice could just as easily not exist .
Actually , no . If it had not been for the gay couples and the organizations who helped them fight for equality it would n't be an issue now , but it would still be an issue .
Based on who 's opinions ? Atheist.com and christianssuck.com ?
Do you see cops driving down the road , going over the speed limit , turning on their lights during rush hour to get to their exit which is just a little ways ahead and then turn their lights off after they exit the highway . People who enforce the law think that they are better than the law , and do n't have follow the law , even if they enforce the law , or make them , i personally think that is Bull**** ! ! !
For me , this is like the idea that the speed of light was once very fast and has now slowed down . Both ideas indirectly call god a liar . This is bad . If all of our experiments show the Earth is 4.5 billion years old , then that is how old it is . If the Bible says something different , then either God meant Genesis for peoples past and now uses scientists to explain things better ( though I am uncomfortable with this idea as many scientists are atheists ) , or our puny minds , compared with God 's , have n't yet worked out how Genesis and an old Earth tie together .
Prove it ! Prove that there would be no rooted trees at all within the sedimentary layers at all . And prove that there would be no tracks or burrows or evidence of plant life as we find . In fact we would expect to find all of those things as evidence that this event was fast and cataclysmic in order to find all of these things together in the same areas .
But your new language would be meaningless . The definition of a circle or a square does not vary from language to language . Mathematical definitions are not matters of opinion but quite precise descriptions so that all mathematicians will understand what is meant when the term is used . The words may change but the meaning does n't . Math is not opinion . It is not my opinion that a triangle has three angles . That is a matter of definition . Apparently Habbit does n't understand that substituting the words of another language does not change the concept . That sort of argument is basically ignorant XXXX .
Religious faith , by definition , is a `` jump in the dark '' and there is really little ( if any ) common intellectual ground on which Creationism and Scientific Materialism can meet . In principle , given adequate evidence etc. , there is nothing in the material world that can not be explained by Science . But someone who has , so to speak , already jumped into the dark can not see this . The most interesting questions that a supernatural account of human life can raise are concerned with the evolution of law , morality , social conventions , aesthetic sensibility and such like .
And that is meaningless babble . Evolution is a process that has been observed whether you like it or not . It is not a moral statement nor is it a statement of faith . It does not deal with government , laws or culture . Whining about it wo n't change it .
I think they are doing it out of fear . They see the moral decline in America and they have latched onto the GLBT Community as their scapegoat . Since it 's no longer PC To attack African-Americans for their obvious differences , it 's not PC to go after other religions ( especially Judaism - not that it actually stops pure hate groups from doing it ) they have decided that attacking a group of people which are sexually different should be the way to go . I mean , their religion tells them that premarital sex is bad and wrong . Even though there is a multi-billion dollar industry based around HETEROSEXUAL sex , they actually depend on that money too much to bite the hand that feeds them . Insted , they attack a group that has not legal rights to marriage let alone little legal standing as far as individual rights . It 's easier that way .
Huh ? With a 26 '' barrel the .50 is good out to 2100 yards . With the 29 or 36 that increases to 2500 , but the world record sniper shot was made with a .50 BMG and it was 2657 ( 1.51 miles ) .
Write me an essay on Obamanomics .
You did n't answer the question jimmy-boy . Should the woman be forced ( because that is what you are advocating ) to bear a pregnancy that resulted from a rape ? I 'm not interested in those who decide to keep the child ( good luck to them ) but individuals who want the course of their life to be altered as little as possible by their ordeal . Do would you force them to carry that child ?
And thus , pro-choicer are more mathematical and scientifical . We are more logical than the pro-lifers , and just do n't blindly make assumptions about human life , because of its consequences .
Because some restrictions that might pass constitutional muster , do n't amount to an outright ban . How would impossibility ever be considered constitutional ?
Is there a point here ? Did n't the dissenting Justices all agree that the right is an individual right , claimable and enforceable by individuals ? It is clear the Stevens dissent was focused on a misreading of Miller 's holding and his just for gun rights metamorphosis supporting the illegitimate assumption that the government can exercise vast unspecified and unenumerated powers just because it feels like it . In Heller Stevens abandons his belief in Roe 's `` prenumbra '' theory , that the Bill of Rights is just a rough outline of liberty interests that stand as examples of many others . I endorse Justice Harlan 's dissent in Poe without Stevens ' recent equivocation and find it to be a compelling argument in constitutional interpretation , since elevated to the opinion of the Court in a case which Stevens concurred : `` Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects . See U.S . Const. , Amdt . 9 . As the second Justice Harlan recognized : ' [ T ] he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause can not be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution . This `liberty´ is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property ; the freedom of speech , press , and religion ; the right to keep and bear arms ; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures ; and so on . It is a rational continuum which , broadly speaking , includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints , . . . and which also recognizes , what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must , that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment . ' '' Casey v. Planned Parenthood , 505 U.S. 833 , 848 ( 1992 ) This famous exposition is a long standing favorite of Stevens . He cited it in his dissent in Albright v. Oliver , 510 U.S. 266 , 306-07 ( 1994 ) . But he abandons his relationship with these ideals in Heller ? Give me a break . . . Who 's sacrificing his principles for policy ? At least Scalia 's error results in an outcome that is consistent with his fundamental beliefs . That can not be said for Stevens . Just for info sake , Harlan 's dissent is also quoted in the plurality ( Stevens concurring ) in Moore v. City of East Cleveland , 431 U.S. 494 , 502 ( 1977 ) , it was originally written by Justice Harlan in his dissent in Poe v. Ullman , 367 U.S. 497 , 543 ( 1961 )
Another lie they told was that churches would be forced to perform gay marriages regardless of their religious desires . Blatantly false , with no evidence to back it up .
It does n't matter what you think . You are wrong simply because you have learned your `` evolution '' from creationists .
Please do . I always enjoy a good twisted leftist view of the Constitution . But I 'll warn you , the Preamble has no legal standing .
According to history . I see you litterally ignored how it was wrong when one looks at how blacks were treated . How does it not ? Blacks were paid less because they were black , Black soldiers were n't sent to fight because they were black . Black officers could n't even command moderate level units . Black soldiers were treated as slaves when captured and often executed , not even afforded the rights of captured white northern soldiers . In fact it went so far as if a White officer in command of a black unit was captured , he was executed because he commanded a black unit . White officers captured from white units were treated as prisoners . White soldiers who did n't even speak english recruited off immigrantion ships from Europe were paid the normal amount . White soldiers were sent to fight , not sent to dig fortifications or ditches or latrines . Blacks were not treated equally in any way during the war , and reconstroction period in the north and the south shows a stark contrast in a belief of unequal creation . I suggest you go back and learn something about the war before talking about it .
1+1=2 if we know the meaning or not where do concepts come from when all that exist is matter , we know concepts are outside and are not dependent on matter or experence , or being discovered ( if we did not discover them they would still exist ) how can matter bring about something that is not matter

In the latter case , that 's because more fornicators are shacking up rather than getting married , which is why there 's fewer divorces . If a state allows gay marriages their spirituality is in the toilet . Gay sex sin is a perversion and an abomination according to the Bible .
Criminals get guns from strawman purchases . When someone with no criminal record legaly buy a gun to sell to a `` friend '' with a criminal record . They people who sell criminals guns do not just do it once , they do it again and again . Some of the guns used in Colombine were obtained this way . The seller knowingly sold them to minors and got less that 6 months in jail . Many times these people are not even prosecuted , will still have clean records , and will continue to buy and sell guns to `` friends '' . If your serious about stopping availibility of guns to criminals , then these people should go into the slammer for a long long long time . http : //www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontl ... ocon/guns.html
Well , I was just giving a different perspective from a witness who was also there , so obviously not everyone sees the events the same way . The thing is though , if they were booting people for being biased against the movie , or because they would object to it 's message , it stands to reason they would n't have let anyone in PZ Myer 's party in as well . And do you seriously think that if Richard Dawkins ' name was registered on the website they would n't have noticed that ? I find that pretty hard to believe . It stands to reason there were other perhaps un-related reasons Myers was booted than his objections to the content of the movie . Furthermore , if the producer deliberately started a discussion , then it only further stands to reason he did n't mind opposing viewpoints toward the movie .
You mean , `` Materialistic evolution claims nothing that is outside the realm of the material '' .
So you think that only the sentence structure needs to be examined and not the meaning of the words ?
TF Green was a small little airport when I moved here 10years ago . It is now 10 times that size with multiple terminals and dozens of airlines . Yes , it has changed . It would be fun ! My friends are trying to talk me into a UUC minister . Since we do n't really have anyone to officiate the ceremony , I am guessing that is the ruote we will need to take . We did decide today to axe the cake thing ... .too hetero for me . We decided it really will be at my boss 's house ... ..yeah ! We picked a date in September ... ... woo woo . I will update you all as we plan !
It is very clear you have n't research this issue very well . Let me ask you ( and I would hope that no one else responds but nocturnal to this question ) ; If I killed someone in my own home is this a choice I can make ... who should care right ?
This judge stated that it was UN-Constitutional ( according to California Constitution ) to limit marriage to opposite-gender couples . So . . . . . why did we vote in 2000 on the definition of marriage ? And since the majority stated that marriage was between one man and one woman - why was that not taken into consideration with this ruling ? Why is it that when the people speak their voice , it is IGNORED ? ? Not only the mayor of SF - but this Superior Court judge as well ?
You are making some false assumptions . However , I guess you are unable to read . I definately know you ca n't read in context .
So influence your genes to break apart . If successful , this would show that genes are required for growth and day-to-day functions . If unsuccessful , this will show that you need to reword that statement .
I think it could impact the health of the man . Seems you are downplaying the role of a man in a childs life . For shame ! I do n't know how you could say the two are n't comparable . You argument is that the mother should n't have to support someone that she does n't wish to support . You are now trying to qualify it by saying a mothers health is the main concern because health is more important than money . So your standard seems to be `` If the human is being supported by another and may adversly hurt someones health than there should be a choice . Otherwise we can restrict choice . Ok , what if child support will cause the man to have to eat worse or work more and thus hurting his health ? Does this not qualify now ? The man 1 ) did n't have a choice and 2 ) has his health adversly affected . Looks to me like you just have a double standard .
This is the United States . We do n't have to sign things against our will .
Basically the entire evolution of the horse , not to mention new species of fruit flies .
and she got punished for it Good thing too because it led to the law being changed . If someone thought drunk driving was an unrighteous law and so they did it and got punished ... I do n't think you will see much sympathy . It many states that is probably true for abortion . Why is it unrighteous anyway ? Only because you disagree with it
This neither disproves evolution nor provides evidence of creationism .
You obviously dont know what your talking about . Ever since Florida became the first state to allow people to carry guns around Florida has been number 1 or 2 in violent crime each year according to the FBI !
Yea just like the racist redneck with his rifle and pistol at the rally that NBC or MSNBC edited !
`` LITTLE ROCK , Ark . ( AP )  Arkansas ' Senate has approved a ban on the sale of realistic-looking toy guns after stripping from the title the name of a West Memphis boy fatally shot by police . By a 20-6 vote , the Senate approved the measure to prohibit the sale of play guns that are designed to look like the real thing . Sen. Tracy Steele , the bill 's Senate sponsor , said the measure merely mirrors what 's already in federal law . The House had approved the measure , which was originally named the DeAunta Farrow Imitation Firearms Act , after the West Memphis boy who was fatally shot by a police officer who said the boy was holding a gun . But the bill 's sponsor agreed to remove the boy 's name from the bill after complaints from the family , who dispute police accounts that DeAunta was holding a toy weapon . The boy was shot to death in 2007 and a civil lawsuit is pending . '' Ark . Senate OKs ban on sale of toy guns that look real
Entirely wrong on this point . I was in sierra leone during hte rebellion , nad they did have a working government structure from begining to end . Civilians in rebel controlled portions of sierra leone were hacked apart with machetes ( literally ) and horribly treated because they had no way to fight back . In several circumstances , entire villages were bypassed by the rebels becasue one or 2 people had ignored the ban on guns . Rebels showed up , took fire from the town , and went and found an easier town to pick on . There was a move by certain british folks who worked for certain british companies to arm the civilian population . Unfortunatly , the UN impoased an arms embargo against sierra leone and short circuited the plan .
Does that mean a pat on the head is n't the same as getting a peice of chocolate cake ?
Actually it is the creationists who do n't know what they are talking about . If they wish to talk about cosmology , then by all means talk about it . Just do n't pretend that anything discusses has any bearing on evolutionary theory .
Nope . Not the parts that are taught in high school . The conjecture is mostly at the molecular level these days .
Do some research . People collect functional tanks and aircraft . Did you ever hear of the Confederate Air Force ? They restore and fly military aircraft . As for tanks , there are many web sites that promote collecting tanks and other military vehicles . And people shoot laws rockets . They just do not shoot live HE rounds . It is a little expensive .
Obviously that is the case . We can not simply say that a certain God exists and have it be so .
There is nothing religious about babies ... . They should be concerned with preventing the death of an innocent person ... who made no mistakes , violated no laws , and whos only crime is existance . if you dont think courts can protect babies , then do you.. deserve any protection ? If a baby can be killed simply because it is an inconvience ... then why does it suddenly become a crime if the baby is 2 days old ? what difference is there between a child in the womb , and one which was just born ? its still the same baby . The point is.. we can prevent all these reckless abortions , if ... if ... if.. we can convince all these wild loose sex acts ... to be done with a condom ... Guys dont like condoms ... . They must be made to recognise that they can not simply walk away . The only time , the girl will give the name ... is when the guy made promises , and refuses to marry ... refuses to care.. and the girl is left alone . in those cases the bastards deserve to do hard labor , for atleast 3 months . The state should promote ... -Mosheh Thezion
Well , the type of atheism you are talking about here requires faith . If you say `` I know there is no god , '' this statement requires faith . You have not observed anything that would lead you to reason or deduce that there must not be a god . The presence of religion has nothing to do with this faith and it 's not a religion , just a gross assumption with no `` proof . ''
And this is from the one who posts links to AiG ... Since everything your complaining about is adressed at TO , I 'm not going to rebut any of your `` arguments '' . Rather , find the counter argument at TO and post what 's wrong with it .
I think you undervalue the combination of poor immigrants and vast untapped natural resources as it pertains to our success .
Really ? You 've sought to intervene so far . Why stop ?
Yes , I mean the couple who was wrongly accused of being Russian spies in the 50 's and then exicuted . This was stupid for at least two reasons . One , they were n't spies . Back about 5 years ago , they had a family member come out and say that they testified wrongly against them . Second , the whole idea of the Russian threat was some paronoid fantasy by this one guy named McCarthy who was an XXXXX and a big fraidy cat . Because of his loonicy , too many people lost jobs wrongfully ( and lives ) and made an entire nation of scared citizens even more frightened . Besides , the Russians were never really a threat to us in the first place . They were more of a threat to themselves .
Not as off-topic as you seem to think , read some of Glenn Morton 's pages on the damage done by creationist teaching , on what happens to young people when they discover that they have been lied to so much . My own church has doubled in size in the past few years , I was recently on an advisory group looking at expanding the building . You seem scarce in these parts lately . I had a wonderful spring break visiting friends in Prague . Hope you had a chance to get away .
I see no evidence of a straw purchase having actually taking place . The video is so grainy and jumpy you can barely make out anything . And there 's no camera evidence from the female investigator who was supposedly filling out the paperwork . And there are so many jumps in footage it almost looks like the film was cut multiple times to tell a brand new story . Although I did notice at the beginning the introduction stated that it 's illegal for someone to fill out the paperwork for you , and that it 's a federal felony . So once again I must ask , if they have this evidence on tape , why were no arrests made ? Supposedly these are licensed investigators , fully authorized and everything . Why did they choose to let a blatant offense go unpunished ? By law and duty they were obligated to make arrests on the scene .
The mechanism , according to biologists , is a random mutation that would usually not reproduce much , but reproduces when the rest of the bacteria are removed . The mutation becomes a standard gene at this point .
Actually science is not sure whether expansion will continue indefineitely , whether it will stop and remain stable , or whether it will collapse . Last I heard collapse was not given good odds . Hovind is probably behind the curve here .
Actually what are YOU most afraid of.. Perhaps your skyrocketing violence since they confiscated your guns is not enough of an eyeopener as to the perils of tyrannical government intrusion into a persons life , liberty , etc at the expense of your personal saftey.. Perhaps the hail mary at the bottom of your post is all you have left ! Britain , Australia top U.S. in violent crime g'day mate ! MOLON LABE
Christianity is a belief , not a trait . If one claims to be a Christian -and is n't lying- , then they are .
Actually , Galileo was n't killed . He was sentenced to house arrest . And his sin was in declaring that the earth moved since the Bible states that the earth does n't move .
And if intelligence is not involved in evolution but rather is a product of evolution then life is not intelligently designed . Which of the two alternatives do you think has empirical support . Whats the IQ of the metaphorical pond scum ? From whence did an `` intelligent '' organizing force arise ? And so forth .
And you just sound ignorant . You would n't make this statement if you knew about how Britain 's current gun control laws came into existence .
For a 'comedian ' , you 're not very funny..
You 've forced me to get out of my chair and dig through the bookshelf . Hardcopy Funk and Wagnalls copyrighted 1954 -1956 reads as follows : `` Other atomospheric gases are argon , 9400 ppm ; ... neon 18 p.p.m . ; ... xenon . 0.09 p.p.m . The carbon-dioxide content of the air is about 0.03 percent by volume . Although it may be subject to slight local variations , this percentage is maintained nearly constant by carbon dioxide dissolving into or evaporating from the waters of the oceans . The carbon dioxide content of sea water is about a thousand times as great as that of the atmosphere . '' Wikipedia is a handy tool but I do n't give them credit for understanding what the reality of our atmosphere was 65 years ago - let alone 150 years ago . Now these ppm readings : What is the 0.03 % comparison ?
Clearly you have never lived on the streets , and clearly you have never done any kind of study into the social ramifications of being homeless and/or living in constant poverty . Sure , not every kid that grows up impovrished is going to fall into a cycle of poverty , substance use , low self-esteem , and abuse ( physical , emotional , sexual ) . A lot of them will . Too many of them will . It is naive and ignorant to tell someone that that kind of life is acceptable simply because they still have the `` privilege '' of existing .
And we know this how ? You complain about the 90 % figure being erroneous and then make an unsupported statement like this ? Furthermore , if Mexico is making an earnest attempt to smash the cartels and we 're financing it in part , would n't we want to help reduce the weapons traffic flowing south into the cartel 's arsenals ?
I 'm a little surprised by this . The polls I 've seen show that Mass voters favor gay marriage . I would have thought that getting those who oppose it to put their opposition on the record before the elections would be beneficial . Then again , seeing as how the lies and fear mongering have already started , I can see how they might want to avoid having the elections muddied with the inevitable dirty fighting that would be thrown at them . Not the most couragous stance , but perhaps safer in the long run . You are right that the longer society fails to collapse the more inane the doomsayers seem .
Well , exactly . The point is that where culture has moved on , so has religion : the Catholic Church is notable now for not burning people . You could similarly argue against government , on the grounds that governments used to take part in Crusades , execute people for the smallest offense etc .
Given my last paragraph it should be clear why I do n't agree with this . I also am not aware of any theories that imply any kind of extratemporal phenomena , only speculations as to what ( if anything ) may have happened before the Big Bang . If anything did ( eg previous Big Crunch ) that is not outside time , that is only time that is inaccessible to us in terms of observation .
PENNSYLVANIA CONSTITUTION Section 21 . Right to Bear Arms The right of the citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State shall not be questioned . I do n't see the word `` qualified '' in there .
Firearms are n't comparable to cigars and cigarettes . We 've explained that before , but you just continue to ignore the facts . Guns and drugs are n't the same , they ca n't be compared . Shooting NEVER causes cancer , however the carcinogens in cigarettes DO cause cancer .
This verse seems to point out that Jeremiah was more than simply a `` product of conception . '' He was a product of the Creator , formed in the womb by Him in the same manner that Adam was formed out of the dust and in the image of the maker .
No , but it does develop very late on , and most abortions are carried out early . Over 99 % is pretty high , considering abortions carried out very late tend to be because of problems medically with the mother or the foetus where an abortion is the best option .
But of course . Growth is a kind of change . But I suspect that certain religious attitudes are that change is bad . They prefer to hold the status quo as it was somewhere around 1600 .
Really ? Can you link to a creationist website that does not connect evolution to people doing bad things ?
Well at least you ca n't have a drive by swording . You can run from a sword . They are pretty tough to conceal in a bank robbery .
Really ! Will you grant me the same benefit ? Lets just say I have no moral problem with physically hurting you . Would you suggest that people who think that is wrong should not impose their belief system on me ? You would certainly think they should impose their belief system on me . Chances are you would say something like `` well , I am a human so therefore I have certain rights '' to which I would respond that chloe and I believe the fetus is a human and we believe you are a human too so therefore the same standard applies . The argument about not pushing your beliefs on others just never works because every law is pushing beliefs on people .
No argumewnt there .
So your definition of `` human being '' is someone who has already been born ? Many fetuses are capable of surviving separate from there mother . In that case , by your definition , they are human beings .
The *mind* ( self-owned ) holds beneficial possibilities ( that self-deceived atheists in the current culture-of-death do n't realize ) . Fortunately , we can choose to follow Jesus Christ , in His culture-of-*life ... Abundant* Rather than dying , how much do you want to Live Annie
Rationalizing again It is It 's truly less harmful than alcohol . [ /quote ] Rationalizing again It is still worse then alcohol with one beer or even 2 beers a day ( which is pretty much average for a person of non-college age ) . You have a guy drink a beer a day and a guy smoke up a day and see the difference in 50yrs ... you will know which one is the weed addict . I 've lost 2 friends to weed and my gf has actually had a friend get his head blown off so you probably wo n't convince me it is a good drug ... .however , like alcohol , it is impossible to convince someone addicted about how their addiction hurts them .
Even though that may be true , stats have shown that sex is actually healthy for a romantic relationship . Although I agree 100 % that more people should be using condoms or other birth control methods , abstaining from sex is not always the smartest thing to do .
You are absolutely correct . Scientists do science . Philosophers wander around inside their own domain . On the other hand I am much more interested in the scientific merits of NDS and EAM than in the musings of philosophers . Science supports NDS , science fails to support the vitalist views of EAM . Simple as that . Its not a philosophical issue , its a scientific one .
Right on .
Do n't quote yourself . What did I just say ? Nothing is ever proven , except in math . But , yes , papers are published all the time with loads of evidence pointing to the fact that birds evolved from dinosaurs . Alligators were not dinosaurs when dinos were around and still are n't . Neither are monitor lizards . Btw- monitors started appearing right as the dinos died out , but they were not and are not dinos .
Actually , if there was ever a time when Christianity could be reconcilled with evolution , it is in the modern context . Do n't go suggesting that all Christians find evolution as contradictory to the Bible , it is only the case in certain instances .
So , you agree that your proposal for pro-life advocates may not be reasonable ?
A broken-down tv set is not a valid parallel . It does n't reproduce , and there is only one of it . Life , on the other hand , does reproduce ( at least some organisms do ) . It would be interesting for someone to make a counter displaying the number of times natural selection needs to be explained to creationists . Actually , that would be easy : infinity . They just do n't get it .
lol , and you prove my point ... rationalization for the win
Fetuses do not call the doctor at all . But if they did , I do n't think it would be for him to kill them .
Actually , monkeys do not change into humans . The ancestor of all primates had the potential to become many different things . If a primate were to change ( somehow ) , it probably would not become human . By the way , such a change will not be shown within your lifetime . Are n't you aware of the thousands of years involved ?
Well , you got that one exactly right . I did n't bother to watch your video . It was pretty predictable coming from you - personal attacks on creationists . I quoted YOU because of what YOU said .
Not necessarily . It depends on a lot of conditions . If an organism falls in an anoxic environment , it may be fossilized . Sometimes they are buried quickly . Sometimes not . For example , the bottom of the Solnhofen lagoon about 140 to 170 million years ago was anoxic . Today , the bottom of the Black Sea is anoxic . You do n't explain why a bone has to be under pressure . I thought it was mineralization that made the fossil . And so what ? You seem to be claiming that there are n't any fossils . You ca n't be that dense , can you ? What are those things that you find in museums of natural history ?
I most certainly did address his claim . I said he was right , God is not a science-stopper . BUT , that does n't mean you teach it in school . The great thing about science is it is open to anyone willing to put forth the effort to perform experimentation and publish the results . If someone can find something out while assuming there was a creator , they should publish it . That 's the great thing , is that no one is telling you ID is wrong , just that we should n't teach it as fact in science class . It currently is taught as a hypothesis , but the THEORY of evolution is a scientific theory . I fail to see why ID is even close to the level of evolution . The Flying Spaghetti Monster also has some possible advances , including the decrease in pirates . And science does n't disprove the Flying Spaghetti Monster , but it does n't teach it either , because it has no scientific evidence and is not falsifyable .
the only thing i see that would be a NFA would be the `` Semi-automatic pistol with A folding , telescoping or thumbhole stock '' of corse having a stock means it is not a pistol , but a SBR , but why let facts stop them . i wpnder if the bb guns that you put the bb in a plastic cartrage would quilifie as an assalt rifle if this passes .
I know we know a great deal but even if it is from a taxonomy point of view I still do n't think there is conclusive evidence .
I see you 're right there . The trends here can not be simply based on the number of searches because every trend would be climbing in that case as more and more people own computers . I think the trend at any one point is calculated something like this - ( volume of trend search at given point / total search volume at given point ) Here another way to compare side by side - http : //www.google.com/trends ? q=Chris ... ate=all & amp ; sort=0
** Meaning ? ! ? !
I see no evidence that this is reliable . Where 's the proof that this is n't just another cherry picked article , made up from the polling of people who live in states like California , New York , New Jersey , Illinois and other such communist territories ? Furthermore , where 's the proof that these people are true and genuine gun owners ?
And if it depends on `` what definition of speciation you use , '' why did n't you give yours so that we can be clear as to what we are discussing . Finally , macroevolution is not 'the concept that at certain times evolution makes huge jumps in genetic shifts that result in new species ( an over simplification and there are many theories in specie formation ) . ' Speciation does not require `` huge jumps in genetic shifts , '' whatever that means ( another example of semi-literate English ) . Would you like to hear of some examples of single populations in which the geographical extremes are separate species ( i.e. , they have overlapping ranges and are genetically isolated ) ?
Oh dear . We once again see the fallacious 'information ' argument being used . The craters on the moon give us information about past impacts , do we demand that information has a 'sender ' ? Spectroscopy gives us information about the constitution of stars , do we demand that information has a 'sender ' ? And indeed even if we use the argument that all 'information ' has a sender and recipient , genetic material has ... neither . It 's just chemicals and forces . Nothing more . There is no identifiable 'sender ' , and there is no identifiable 'recipient ' . Sure , you can chuck a god in here or there if you like , but that 's not where the evidence leads . DNA is not a code , DNA is certainly not a 'language ' , and it only falls under the definition of 'information ' that pretty much everything we decide to look at does .
But you protest and get all hysterical when someone suggests restricting terrorists from buying guns . You are either a stupid person occupying America or you really do support terrorists .
Yes , so let 's give them a chance to examine what you actually said , all over again :

I love Jesus John the Beloved is my most favorite writer throughout time If you think I have a problem with a follower of Jesus your wrong . I have a problem with the Christians
Really would please prove this statement . I do n't recall the christian religion and the bible being mentioned in the constitution . Would you please point to the artical or amendment that they are mentioned ? So you do n't care about seperation of church and state ? Would you feel the same if the laws reflect the dietary laws that are mentioned in leviticus ? Would you feel the same way if the majority of yuour neighbors were satinists and the majority of the community voted to only allow the church of satin to exsist and all members of the community had to attend ? See the seperation of chruch and state protects everyone . It protects the state from influencing the church and the church from influencing the state . The wall must stay up .
You 're the expert on that feeling ... ..
Yes , God does take away sinful desires . ( If you ask Him . ) I 'm not saying that it does n't take any work on your part , though . When you have a sinful desire , you allow a thought to become more than just a stray idea . You foster and encourage the thought and it becomes a desire . God takes away the desires , helps you deal with your `` stray thoughts '' , and shows you how to keep them from becoming desires .
I believe suicide is murder , no matter how you look at it . It 's already illegal , and if you do it , then chances are you 're either taking PCP or are mentally unstable .

It has absolutely everything to do with supposedly lower homicide rates . If there 's a low homicide rate in one selected country , and the police have the authority to beat a confession out of you and make annual inspections of your home , then those are facts that the people need to be aware of . You ca n't just claim `` Country A has more gun control and a lower homicide rate than Country B does '' and leave it at that . You 've got to give absolutely every single fact available if you ever hope to draw a proper comparison .
Your assumption that the parents are less mature than the child is equally as ludicrous as your claim that a 14 year old is mature enough to make this decision before she is old enough to sign ANY LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT , and that includes 15 , 16 and 17 year olds . They are still below the age of consent so the issue should be moot . But unfortunately , in this day and age when parents are becoming more like caretakers rather than moral guides , it is only a matter of time before they lose all authority over their child 's decisions to the State .
Top that .
Which lie is that ?
You mean just as Ripskar did , and then pandion after him ? And since when is giving ones opinion making something up on a debate forum ? And why are you taking basic statements I make and attacking me as if this is a relevant issue at all , while completely ignoring the fact that both ripskar and pandion made the same bet type statement ? Have you no sense of fair play at all ? Or are you just here to troll after me and nit pick every obscure statement I make ?
Justice ? Equality ? I realize that people who `` do n't recognize gay marriage '' often do n't have those things in mind when it comes to gays , but those would be the reasons ...
Actually , it is quite apparent that you do not . For one glaring example , below you incorrectly state that a dinosaur fossil has been dated by C-14 . Another example of you lack of understanding of the topic is your failure to understand why very old fossils are found on the surface and the principles of dating from geologic strata .
It 's easy , I let creation speak to me .

Hey , bring it on . A month ago , I read over your 'failed prophecies ' and if you are ready to listen , there is no problem explaining what happened with Nebuchadnezzar and Egypt . It is mature fare and hard for even Christians to accept sometimes , but the long and short of it is this : you do n't even begin to know the God you are dealing with . If you give me a space of time to get things together , I can introduce you to a being who is so much like you that you will almost be fooled into feeling that you 're his `` buddy '' then I will introduce you to the same being who can tear you to pieces if he chooses ( Ps . 50 ) Here 's a hint though about what happened in Egypt : God changed his mind . But you did n't know he could do that ? You would be surprised how much like you he really is . He changed his mind several times in the text of the Bible : Abraham tried to get Him to but could n't get Him to stop his destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah , God was out to kill Moses ' sons , but Moses quickly circumcised them and God changed his mind , also Moses succeeded in changing God 's mind when Moses learned that He was out to destroy the Israelites , God was determined to level Ninevah but after Jonah preached He changed his mind because the people repented , God spoke to the prophet Jeremiah saying : When I pronounce judgment on a peoples but they later turn from their sins , I will change my mind concerning the judgment I had determined on them . But be careful - when He is set on doing something , it gets done . Just when you think you have a `` pal '' in God , he says something like this to the prophet Ezekiel : when a land sins against Me , though Noah and Daniel and Job are in it , they will deliver but their own souls . Even righteous Noah could n't stay the hand of the Almighty when He was dead set on destroying the first world . Real quick : one of the major ways God judges a people group is via another wicked people or wicked king . Happens time and time again in scripture . Do n't have time to elaborate right now . Nebuchadnezzar was a wicked king and in God 's hand he was simply a pawn to use to punish other nations . So while God is using him to punish Egypt , He is punishing Nebuchadnezzar and his nation as well . Get it ? Is it too mature for you ? Do n't believe it ? Too bad ... .it 's true . God will bring a nation to full dominance and power in order to punish other nations . When He is through using them , He will often turn His wrath on the punishing nation who was His original `` servant '' so to speak . This is mature teaching . Most Christians do n't like it . Too bad ... .it 's true . You do n't even begin to understand the God you are dealing with and the One you are rebelling against and the One you are defying day by day . One day , He will be finished with you as well . Psalms gives your day of prophecy like this ( God is speaking ) : All these things you have done and I kept silent . You thought I was altogether like you , but I will come and and rebuke you and tear you to pieces . Ps 50:21 Know what happened with your 'failed prophecy ? ' God changed His mind ! Maybe you ought to start praying that He will change His mind about your destiny as well .
Oh , then you plan on linking to a source ?
I 'd agree ... .. faith is a `` leap in the dark '' ( or whatever similiar phrase we care to use ) on at least some level , there is always an element of the intangible there . I know Christians who have described there faith to me in such terms before.. sounds quite reasonable to me .
I know , it fell from the sky , didnt it ? No , ok , then it swam ashore , no ? I know how about GOD created it , hold on , how did god come about ? Hmmmmmm , maybe it just appeared , or even better , scottie beamed it down , thats sounds good . But i got an even better one , some clever scientist boffin built a time machine and sent one back in time , thats it . Any other ideas ?
We 're all addicted to something . I had a tough time recently giving up coffee . It was interfering with my life . It was making me feel like XXXX , I could n't sleep right , my bowels were out of whack , but I could n't just stop cold turkey . I tried , but I got these really bad headaches and my whole body felt like XXX . It was hell at work , my head felt like it was going to explode and I was achy all the time . I had to gradually wean myself from it . Now I drink tea which has less caffiene but I still sometimes feel like I have to have it . Since I 've cut down ( I do n't think I 've really gotten totally over my caffiene addiction ) I fell so much better . I have more energy during the day , I do n't wake up half dead desperately needing a quad espresso .
I 've filled marc in on this before , but as usual he 's ignoring the information that he does n't like . ( Besides , marc , why single out evolution ? Why are n't you for putting stickers on all science books labeling all of that satanic , methodological naturalistic study as highly suspect ? )

They used to tell us that in school a long time ago . Then they started doing EEGs and other types of brain scans and they found that everyone uses all of their brain . I 'm not sure how I could use more of my brain .
An independant perspective does n't make it a good thing . Politicians that propose anti-gun legislation do n't have to live in the real world with those of us that the bill will affect , they should n't be allowed to propose it .
So an 17 year old is fine to make a decision not to have a child with an abortion but not with a another procedure ? Also permenent infertility once again is my choice no one else should have any say in the matter . But of course let 's all make decisions for the individual right ? > _ > Yeah once again so much for a women 's right to choose . It 's my body and you guys have nothing to do with it regardless of my age or the wiseness of my decision . Because of course all 17 year old girls who want their tubes tied just want to have unprotected pregnancy free sex right ? Ca n't be that I have a severe genetic disorder that could be passed on that or that I am fully aware that I detest children ohhh no I just want to have risk free sex Ca n't be that I do n't want to have to go through an abortion because I 'm fully aware of the fact that it is a permanent procedure ( that fetus/child/whatever the heck you wan na call it ) is gone forever . Meh though I 'll find a doctor who will do it . Just as those girls who wanted abortions did when it was illegal . The sad thing is though I should n't have to .
An immaculately presented response , entirely avoiding the topic , or indeed reason , in order to unwittingly further the case for retrospective abortion .
That 's actually slightly unfair . There are many XXXXXX that freely admit they see their personal choice of god as the obvious candidate for that `` Someone '' . It 's only when they come to tackle the `` separation of church and state '' issue of the US constitution that they seem to develop amnesia over just who they think this someone is ...
I see you offer no links to posts or anything other than this baseless allegation . Do you think you could maybe provide a link to a post where I have engaged in a tactic that I have accused others of ? Please ? I do n't think you can .
So how can THIS end up good ? How do we fix this ? What ? More gun control ?
This is a racist statement . Also unsurprising from the anti-choice/anti-life crowd . And their constellation of views .
Well , at least the biological sciences and physics . The physicists also try to devise ways to keep their pet theories afloat so that the vast majority of the population can continue to be snow-blinded . Take their lie that there is some magical attraction between bodies of matter . The truth lies in Intelligent Falling - glory to the intelligent designer .
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I do not believe that the supreme court adressed the the problem of convicted fellons having the death penelty reduced to life in prison and going on to kill in prison .
Here is what fascinates me about the judgmental criticism you offer of my opinion . In typical fashion you make claims which you do n't support at all . Here is my post below , point out WITH EVIDENCE ! ! ! what I am distorting in any way ; especially that which I hold dear . In other words , write a cogent and rational post which makes sense when applied to the quoted post it intends to attack .
Forwarded to me by one of my co-workers ; `` HR 45 Blair Holt Firearm Licensing & amp ; Record of Sales Act of 2009 Please send this to everybody on your list ... this is Obama gun control by secrecy . Very Important for you to be aware of a new bill HR 45 introduced into the House . This is the Blair Holt Firearm Licensing & amp ; Record of Sale Act of 2009 . We just learned yesterday about this on the Peter Boyles radio program . Even gun shop owners did n't know about this because it is flying under the radar . To find out about this - go to any government website and type in HR 45 or Google HR 45 Blair Holt Firearm Licensing & amp ; Record of Sales Act of 2009 . You will get all the information . Basically this would make it illegal to own a firearm - any rifle with a clip or ANY pistol unless : .It is registered .You are fingerprinted .You supply a current Driver 's License .You supply your Social Security # .You will submit to a physical & amp ; mental evaluation at any time of their choosing .Each update - change or ownership through private or public sale must be reported and costs $ 25 . - Failure to do so you automatically lose the right to own a firearm and are subject up to a year in jail . .There is a child provision clause on page 16 section 305 stating a child-access provision . Gun must be locked and inaccessible to any child under 18 . The Government would have the right to come and inspect that you are storing your gun safely away from accessibility to children and fine is punishable for up to 5 yrs . in prison . If you think this is a joke - go to the website and take your pick of many options to read this ... OpenCongress - Text of H.R.45 as Introduced in House Blair Holt 's Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act of 2009 It is long and lengthy . But , more and more people are becoming aware of this . Pass the word along . Any hunters in your family - pass this along . He suggests the best way to fight this is to tell all your friends about it and `` spring into action '' . Also , he suggests we all join a pro-gun group like the Colorado Rifle Association , hunting associations , gun clubs and especially the NRA . This is just a `` termite '' approach to complete confiscation of guns and disarming of our society to the point we have no defense - chip away a little here and there until the goal i s accomplished before anyone realizes it . ( Did Obama promise transparency ? It seems his motives are more and more transparent while his methods are hidden in back rooms . ) This is one to act on whether you own a gun or not . ''
Well then this is what you need to do , Galileo . Your task is to prove beyond any shadow of doubt , that the firearms trace data is related exclusively to criminal transactions , and has nothing to do with legal transactions between legal parties .
Funny . That 's not what the articles say . All of the articles pretty much concentrate on the research as significant in support of the dinosaur/bird link . If you had been paying attention , you would have been aware that it had been previously established through other tests that protein remnants were present . Thus , the amazement that protein remnants so old had been found had already passed .
I 'd find it interesting to discover how many of those 58,000 were looking at very long and serious sentences , but were given a plea deal for reduced charges .
of course . But not as scientific theory . Some people believe that the Holocaust did n't happen , you want to teach that as a scientific theory ?
Ballistic fingerprinting is , like most `` gun control '' a measure that is full of unintended consequences .
But who insists that they do ? Oh ! Wait ! I keep forgetting that your purpose is n't to explain facts but to make evolution look bad . So here you imply that paleontologists make this claim , when in fact they do not .
Well , I was n't an fortunate as you . It took me a few years to see through the fairy tale of evolution and see that God was the only true creator . However , that is a whole 'nother topic .
Well we all know that . But that 's not what I 'm saying . Here we 've got the Brady Campaign telling Starbucks `` We 're appalled that you allow people to associate in such a free manner ! Change it right now ! '' but they just do n't seem to understand they 're pushing something that has no legal standing . This would be the equivalent of someone going up to the person behind the counter and saying they do n't want to share the Starbucks coffee house with people who work blue collar jobs , and asking for them to be removed immediately . Such ideas date back to the era of open racism and a lack of rights for black people . Simply because the policies are being enforced in a colorblind manner does n't mean that it 's not still racist or evil .
But , do you have a rational explanation for the Big Bang ?
No , I know this to be true . As shown , over and over .
The `` truth '' about atheism is that it 's the only proposition that makes sense ( apart from agnosticism ? ) to people who conclude , as I do , that religious principles are not based on reason . I know it 's a bit unusual in a public forum but I 'd like to introduce a little personal history here by way of illustration of my path to atheism : I was educated during my most impressionable years ( 11-18 ) at a grammar school controlled by the Jesuits . All my teachers were priests and many were of formidable intellect . Every morning began with `` divine service '' , every lesson was started and ended with a prayer . At noon we sang the Angelus and at 3.30 in the afternoon we finished the school day with Benediction . We had at least one session a day learning and reciting the catechism - so we could be word perfect in our answers to metaphysical questions . Yet all this religious conditioning failed to arouse any spark of faith in me . Sure , I conformed to all outward appearances , but inwardly I rebelled and I did not believe . So why did n't I believe - because my clergymen teachers gave me no REASONS to do so . When , eventually , during my last days at school I chose to reveal my disbelief - the Rector said , `` Well , after all , faith is a gift from God ! '' , and I had received no such gift . Since , in my view , there is no reasoned evidence for God 's existence , why succumb to wish-fulfillment ? It 's less comforting but more honest to be an atheist .
Yeah , it does have risk unlike the embryonic stem cells , but I think that if it comes out the way they hope , it will eventually lead to more embryonic uses as well when people realize that this can have risks . I think it is good to have this way as a back up while people argue over the use of cells that would otherwise be disposed , and get some treatment to people who need it rather than letting it be denied to them by anti-abortionists . And yeah , it 's pretty much guaranteed that someone will find something to object about , claiming it is immoral ( maybe it will now be that these stem cells are potential human life and we ca n't use them ) , but it will likely not have as many objections .
Better get back on the meds . It appears that your lithium level has dropped a tad and increased your paranoia . Here 's a little info on the Pope :
Well you have to admit , nobody with a brain would believe or support what the Brady Bunch is blabbering about this time around . Right on their front page they say `` The bill , H.R . 6691 , would allow nearly anyone , even teenagers and children , to carry loaded assault rifles on the streets of our Nation 's Capital '' but the text of the bill says no such thing . There 's no talk of lowering the age for gun ownership below 18 , which is already federal law , there 's no talk of opening up sales of fully-automatic machineguns capable of firing 1,200 rounds per minute , there 's no talk of the bill opening up sales of .50 caliber rifles that can hit a target at over a mile , there 's nothing . All this bill is gon na do is force DC to be in line with the rest of America . How exactly is that a bad thing , and why should n't we support it ?
I see His presence in the wonderful world around me . I have felt His guiding hand in my life . I know others who have the same knowledge of God .
You 're obviously an Obama supporter , they 're the only people who would n't be upset at his abusive tactics of threatening lawsuits against anyone that runs unfavorable ads against him , thus showing that he does n't support the First Amendment .
Well if they 're not spending much time shooting firearms in the first place , then what are you worried about ?
So far as I am aware , nobody but you believes this to be the case .
We do n't need to know how life arose to study what has apparently happened since .
From your `` experts ''
So am I , so are you .
Looks like you did n't copy/paste this one . One obvious error is bolded for you to see .
Actually the bible really barely comments . Look how short and jumbled the Genesis account is . Genesis did not even fit what humans knew when it was written . So matching any creation theory to genesis is impossible . Unless you believe God created the heaven and earth twice , and created animals twice . Sure you can explain it away , but a verbal reading of the ACTUAL TEXT will make your head swim . I dont wana be sacrilegious , but some parts of Genesis makes God look like he was telling a fish story to a really dumb scribe too lazy to get on his camel and go to the library of Alexandria , or worse one of his interns . I am a irrational creationist btw .
Will it be 100 % legal for you to carry a gun ? If the answer is yes . Then so what ? So what if people react with panic ? If you are 100 % legal , then it is your right to carry a gun . Your rights are just as important as thiers . I was once reported by a woman at a gas station for carrying a gun . I was not carrying concealed . I was very professionally dressed and driving a very yuppie car . When the cops came by , I was not the one the cops were XXXXXX at . BTW before the cops arrived I had removed the pistol from my hip and placed it in the glove box .
Well again , this is not what the Bible claims of itself . 2Ti 3:16 All scripture [ is ] given by inspiration of God , and [ is ] profitable for doctrine , for reproof , for correction , for instruction in righteousness : 17 That the man of God may be perfect , throughly furnished unto all good works . In fact , Jesus himself quotes Genesis as though it were literal history ( cf . Genesis 2:24 and Matthew 19:4 , 5 ) . Additionally , Jesus himself said that he was subject to the Old Testament : Matthew 5:17 Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets . I did not come to destroy but to fulfill . The `` law and the prophets '' are a common reference for `` scripture '' or the Old Testament . Either the Bible is what it claims to be , or it is not . If it is not what it claims to be , then how can we possibly trust that Jesus was who he claimed to be ? The two concepts are directly tied together .
They do n't at all ! They even put little innocent kids on their campaign commercials and the giant electronic bilboards on the freeway to give this allure of impending doom . It 's scare tactics and as much as I hate to say it it 's working ... . I pass that sign every day I go home from college and I think I 'm the only car in Corona that has a No on 8 sticker . I get a hell of alot of dirty looks believe me . But I just smile and say God loves you too . It 's sickening how dirty these `` moral '' people will go to immoral means to justify their homophobic bigoted views .
Thank God you have that unfortunate government . It permits you the opportunity to decide on how justice is defined and how it may best be served for all of us . In a perfect world these types of choices would not be necessary , but then in a perfect world there would be no purpose for religion . We do the best we can in proportion to how much we care . Want a different government vote . Want a better government vote wisely . Want a better government quickly . Get others to do the same .
So please tell me who would be the actual criminals if the Government violated the Supreme Law of the Land and made all guns illegal ? But I do thank you for proving that there are people out there who want them all , despite The Bill of Rights says and what the Supreme Court proved was the correct meaning !
Two gun deaths per 100,000 population per year instead of fourteen ?
oh it gets better ... . Significant portions of this article are excerpted from Michael Z. Williamson 's excellent and witty piece , It 's amazing what one has to believe to believe in gun control '' 1 . Banning guns works , which is why New York , DC , & amp ; Chicago cops need guns . 2 . Washington DC 's low murder rate of 69 per 100,000 is due to strict gun control , and Indianapolis ' high murder rate of 9 per 100,000 is due to the lack of gun control . 3 . Statistics showing high murder rates justify gun control but statistics showing increasing murder rates after gun control are `` just statistics . '' 4 . The Brady Bill and the Assault Weapons Ban , both of which went into effect in 1994 are responsible for the decrease in violent crime rates , which have been declining since 1991 . 5 . We must get rid of guns because a deranged lunatic may go on a shooting spree at any time and anyone who would own a gun out of fear of such a lunatic is paranoid . 6 . The more helpless you are the safer you are from criminals . 7 . An intruder will be incapacitated by tear gas or oven spray , but if shot with a .357 Magnum will get angry and kill you . 8 . A woman raped and strangled is morally superior to a woman with a smoking gun and a dead rapist at her feet . 9 . When confronted by violent criminals , you should `` put up no defense -- give them what they want , or run '' ( Handgun Control Inc. Chairman Pete Shields , Guns Do n't Die - People Do , 1981 , p.125 ) . 10 . The New England Journal of Medicine is filled with expert advice about guns ; just like Guns & amp ; Ammo has some excellent treatises on heart surgery . 11 . One should consult an automotive engineer for safer seatbelts , a civil engineer for a better bridge , a surgeon for internal medicine , a computer programmer for hard drive problems , and Sarah Brady for firearms expertise . 12 . The 2nd Amendment , ratified in 1787 , refers to the National Guard , which was created 130 years later , in 1917 . 13 . The National Guard , federally funded , with bases on federal land , using federally-owned weapons , vehicles , buildings and uniforms , punishing trespassers under federal law , is a `` state '' militia . 14 . These phrases : `` right of the people peaceably to assemble , '' `` right of the people to be secure in their homes , '' `` enumerations herein of certain rights shall not be construed to disparage others retained by the people , '' and `` The powers not delegated herein are reserved to the states respectively , and to the people '' all refer to individuals , but `` the right of the people to keep and bear arm '' refers to the state . 15 . `` The Constitution is strong and will never change . '' But we should ban and seize all guns thereby violating the 2nd , 4th , and 5th Amendments to that Constitution . 16 . Rifles and handguns are n't necessary to national defense ! Of course , the army has hundreds of thousands of them . 17 . Private citizens should n't have handguns , because they are n't `` military weapons '' , but private citizens should n't have `` assault rifles '' , because they are military weapons . 18 . In spite of waiting periods , background checks , finger printing , government forms , etc. , guns today are too readily available , which is responsible for recent school shootings . In the 1940 's , 1950 's and1960 's , anyone could buy guns at hardware stores , army surplus stores , gas stations , variety stores , Sears mail order , no waiting , no background check , no fingerprints , no government forms and there were no school shootings . 19 . The NRA 's attempt to run a `` do n't touch '' campaign about kids handling guns is propaganda , but the anti-gun lobby 's attempt to run a `` do n't touch '' campaign is responsible social activity . 20 . Guns are so complex that special training is necessary to use them properly , and so simple to use that they make murder easy . 21 . A handgun , with up to 4 controls , is far too complex for the typical adult to learn to use , as opposed to an automobile that only has 20 . 22 . Women are just as intelligent and capable as men but a woman with a gun is `` an accident waiting to happen '' and gun makers ' advertisements aimed at women are `` preying on their fears . '' 23 . Ordinary people in the presence of guns turn into slaughtering butchers but revert to normal when the weapon is removed . 24 . Guns cause violence , which is why there are so many mass killings at gun shows . 25 . A majority of the population supports gun control , just like a majority of the population supported owning slaves . 26 . Any self-loading small arm can legitimately be considered to be a `` weapon of mass destruction '' or an `` assault weapon . '' 27 . Most people ca n't be trusted , so we should have laws against guns , which most people will abide by because they can be trusted . 28 . The right of Internet pornographers to exist can not be questioned because it is constitutionally protected by the Bill of Rights , but the use of handguns for self defense is not really protected by the Bill of Rights . 29 . Free speech entitles one to own newspapers , transmitters , computers , and typewriters , but self-defense only justifies bare hands . 30 . The ACLU is good because it uncompromisingly defends certain parts of the Constitution , and the NRA is bad , because it defends other parts of the Constitution . 31 . Charlton Heston , a movie actor as president of the NRA is a cheap lunatic who should be ignored , but Michael Douglas , a movie actor as a representative of Handgun Control , Inc. is an ambassador for peace who is entitled to an audience at the UN arms control summit . 32 . Police operate with backup within groups , which is why they need larger capacity pistol magazines than do `` civilians '' who must face criminals alone and therefore need less ammunition . 33 . We should ban `` Saturday Night Specials '' and other inexpensive guns because it 's not fair that poor people have access to guns too . 34 . Police officers have some special Jedi-like mastery over hand guns that private citizens can never hope to obtain . 35 . Private citizens do n't need a gun for self-protection because the police are there to protect them even though the Supreme Court says the police are not responsible for their protection . 36 . Citizens do n't need to carry a gun for personal protection but police chiefs , who are desk-bound administrators who work in a building filled with cops , need a gun . 37 . `` Assault weapons '' have no purpose other than to kill large numbers of people . The police need assault weapons . You do not . 38 . When Microsoft pressures its distributors to give Microsoft preferential promotion , that 's bad ; but when the Federal government pressures cities to buy guns only from Smith & amp ; Wesson , that 's good . 39 . Trigger locks do not interfere with the ability to use a gun for defensive purposes , which is why you see police officers with one on their duty weapon . 40 . Handgun Control , Inc. says they want to `` keep guns out of the wrong hands . '' Guess what ? You have the wrong hands
A human zygote along with its unique genetic code and great potential is a human life , bottom line . Where do you get this idea of `` personhood '' anyway ?
Well that proves his point does n't it ? If you can put up with the phony-ness of the church you can put up with the phony-ness of the republicans . edit edit : I am too , btw
A long time ago , a simple experiment was proposed to supersport . This experiment could easily convince an observer of the validity of his viewpoint . All supersport has to do is tag some Biston betularia such that they can be identified individually , and move typica morphs to polluted areas and carbonaria to cleaner areas . If any individual changes form , supersport would be vindicated . supersport has been ignoring this proposal since its introduction .
So now it 's a massive nation wide government conspiracy to stifle free speech ? Canada stifles and oppresses religious freedom ? Honestly Jyoshu , where do you get this stuff ? This is utter BS , if you can find ANY proof of the Canadian gov't stifling free speech on this issue , religious freedom , or any other issue for that matter , please post it . If not , retract your BS statement , and admit that it 's a fabrication . I honestly do n't think I underestimate it at all . I come across a very broad spectrum of people in my line of work , from one end of the scale to the other . The most common negative response I get is from those that are opposed to homosexuality in general and respond along the lines of `` I do n't like , I do n't want to see it , but rights are rights , as long as it does n't negatively affect me , I do n't have a problem with it/I do n't really care . '' I have come across a couple of people who were strongly opposed to the use of the term `` marriage '' but were fine with allowing homosexual `` civil unions '' . I think you overestimate how big of a `` moral issue '' this really is for most people . Waxy
You know ... zero from zero is still zero ... .
I think a more appropriate question would address what laws you believe would have been effective in preventing the scenario that you inquire about . Justin
So , you have no problem with the fact that this is abortion and was caused by god ?
I 'm not sure what you 're talking about here .
so quit whining , and go start your own buisness .
Amen ! ! Sheeesh , here we go again with this garbage . The funny thing is , it only seems to mostly be the pro gay rights people who go on these silly `` hypocrisy '' witch hunts . People could , no doubt , just as easily find cases to trump where proponents of gay marriage have been promiscuous , divorced , engaged in prostitution , or whatever-other vice-of-the-day is in terms of discreditation . And that too would , of course , be hypocritical . But I never see posts about that here -- nor would I want to . The real reason these cases are posted about is that there are folks here who simply enjoy seeing people they fundamentally disagree with and that they just do n't like get publicly humiliated . All the while , there 's not a one of these 'exposers of hypocrisy ' who would much like having someone do that to them . Personally , I think this need and obvious enjoyment some here have over seeing people get publicly humiliated is , well , sorta disturbing .
Currently none however all the western powers operated this way in the 19th century and people suffered . Let conservatives dismantle regulations and it will be the return to the 19th century .
Well , if that 's how you feel , you do n't have to get involved in our `` war-mongering '' . Odd that you should say that when the majority of people in the US have already forgotten 9-11 ,
Great insight and response to him . I too had my doubts about the veracity of the global warming claims at every level of the propaganda they have spewed from so many different sources , for so long . And those very sources have been exposed as participants in this scam now , which just makes my decade ... Here 's a link to a link I posted in the debate about the scam of carbon credits right here on 4forums back in January of 08 , and an excerpt from that article . Read some of the defenders posts and look at the sources they rely on to justify the global warming scam . It 's absolutely incredible how they just lap up the lies and follow the propaganda like lambs to the slaughter . Will Media Report Global Warming 'Carbon Credit ' Fraud ? By Noel Sheppard ( Bio | Archive ) April 25 , 2007 - 21:54 ET Its conceivable that years from now , Americas media will be reporting one of the biggest frauds in history : the idea that a wealthy person , for instance , soon-to-be-Dr. Al Gore , can purchase carbon credits to offset his lavish lifestyle making him quote carbon neutral. Given the medias love affair with the former vice president as well as advancing man-made global warming hysteria , few American press members have dared to expose this hoax for what it is . However , on Wednesday , an impeccably reputable publication , the Financial Times , published an article that is a deliciously inconvenient truth for folks like Gore , Laurie David , Sheryl Crow , and all the rest of the alarmists that are actively involved in what years from now will be considered one of the biggest scams ever ( emphasis added throughout ): http : //www.4forums.com/political/297828-post25.html
Just look at this media bias ! They do n't even try to hide it ! `` The creature , called the Flying Spaghetti Monster , is the creation of Bobby Henderson of Corvallis , Ore. `` Excuse me , but no . Bobby Henderson of Corvallis , OR is the creation of the FSM ! It 's like saying that YHWH is the creation of ancient Israelites ! Or that Allah is the creation of Mohammed ! This is blatant blasphemy against our Lord and Creator ( it 's even in the Declaration of Independence for crying out loud ! the US is a Pastafarian Nation ! ) We are ALL His creatures . `` Board chairman Steve Abrams , who voted for the new standards , did n't see the picture but said he thinks that the Flying Spaghetti Monster is silly . '' Oh really , Mr. Abrams ? Well , you 'll think it 's really silly when you are n't allowed into heaven to drink from the beer volcano or when you get a real noodling in pasta hell , you heathen ! With all that said , I applaude Mr. Mousley for the courage he has shown in standing up for religious freedom in this carb-forsaken country !
Why in the name of god would you discuss acceptable reasons for domestic ownership of guns in a conference about curtailing illegal international gun trafficking ? The two are entirely unrelated . I seldom hear of people discussing the benifits of marriage during rape prevention seminars . While the two are concievably related , they are entirely seperate topics .
I think even the Court knows that the Fourteenth was not well crafted , at least in terms of forsight . However , once it was ratified the Court really had no choice but to try to work it into the legal landscape . Certainly State power needed to be curtailed to stop such institutions such as slavery , but I do n't think restructuring how the entire Constitution works was the right move .
Thats pure animal behavior . Thats no more logical than saying since I saw a car on the street and moved out of the way that evolution is wrong .
Well i am sure somebody over here in the Nanny state of Australia is trying to ban soap ! !
Ah , you 've engaged in the grammarian nitpick function of debate . Sad , but predictable . Obviously , I was discussing the entire article , which is making that argument . It is generally bad form to quote an entire post when it reaches such length .
Some theists are willing to ignore such discussions . It has nothing to do with whether God exists . As previously stated , this thread topic is meaningless because of our inequality to God and the illogicalness of the question . We do not and will never understand Him totally .
Cereal factories are n't that big of polluters . The largest polluters are energy plants with a few exceptions like some of Alcoa 's smelters which burns one of the dirtiest types of coal in the almunimum production process . And the world will go from bad to worse , from worse to horrible and from horrible to castastrphoic . Not suddenly . That 's day after tomorrow fantasy .
The Hippocrates ? I was under the impression that Hippocrates was the name of a single person .
And no , it is not at all clear that this is not about abortion , Phyl , because you keep bringing the topic up . Because you declare something , that doesnt make it so . Lastly , you are asking the opinions of members of a forum here . If you want our opinions , great . If our opinions differ from some court ruling , it does not mean the opinions are wrong , it means they differ . Given your criterion , the only way to express opinions here would be if we were doing it from the bench .
Actually our school 's Gay-Straight Aliance held a day of silence to show respect for gays who have had to live in silence . They asked the teachers to respect the people in their day of silence and not force them to talk . I think most teachers did n't force students to talk . Unfortunately , some just spoke in sign language for fun and said they were doing it as part of the day of silence .
actually i have a fuzzy theory on how the water on the earth could actually cover land . most scientist agree that the 7 continents were at one point one single flat super-continent ( gondowaland , i think ) . after the continent sections drifted apart , only then did the himalayas and other major mountain ranges and ocean gorges formed . so it could have been possible that all land mass could have been covered by a heavy enough global rain shower , at least until it all drained off . however , scientists argue that this supercontinent existed millions of years before noah , so yall can scrap that idea ... unless the scientists were wrong and the continental split happened quickly , while the earth was under water ... nevermind ... like i said , a fuzzy theory
And why do you say that in ancient times that atheists were people who believed in 'God ( s ) , but did n't belive in intervention ) ( a.k.a Deists ) . Why do you think that people who did n't believe in god exist ?
Is this chart the number of abortions in the U.S. , internationally , or both ? The chart is under the international section on the website . What is considered `` emergency contraception '' as stated on the chart ? Did n't PP perform 213,026 abortions in 2001 ? In 2002 the number of abortions they performed actually increased right ? You say that `` by number of people '' the `` main business '' of PP is offering contraception and sex ed . What is their `` main business '' by revenue ?
I think that if for arguments sake that if Darwin was a racist that carried out genocides then I still do n't see what Macroevolution would have to do with it . I will say it again . If you start with the mistaken belief some people are inferior then Eugenics immediately seems reasonable since it only relies on the idea that some people are inferior and the fact that parents are like their offspring .
Why not read `` The Science of Consciousness & # 8212 ; The Next Scientific Paradigm '' by William A. Guillory , Ph.D. which states in part ... `` The Science of Consciousness is essentially the study of the non-material world . It is the study of metaphysical phenomena that , for the most part , are not subject to the theories and laws of Newtonian-Cartesian science . However , the human implications of the results of studying consciousness , beyond the physical realm , are immense . '' http : //creativityandinquiry.org/Scie ... ciousness.html Consciousness is non-material . Perhaps reading `` Empirical Evidence for the Non-Material Nature of Consciousness '' by Juleon M. Schins might shed some light .
`` Usually , `` rationality '' is a Humpty-Dumpty word , that means whatever the user finds is convenient to club his opponents with . '' http : //world.std.com/~mhuben/skept/rationality.html Knowledge itself is a limited commodity . To make a claim that everything is knowable is a statement that is impossible to prove ; Scientism makes this claim . Closely related to it is Objectivism . `` Scientism , in the strong sense , is the self-annihilating view that only scientific claims are meaningful , which is not a scientific claim and hence , if true , not meaningful . '' http : //skepdic.com/scientism.html Recommended Reading : `` Why People Believe Weird Things : Pseudoscience , Superstition , and Other Confusions of Our Time '' by Michael Shermer Not only does it include creationism , but also the philosophy of Ayn Rand ( Objectivism )
You seem to think that any time someone is killed , the reasoning behind it was that the perpetrator `` devalued human life '' . If that was the case , gun manufacturers , car manufacturers , breweries , and cigarette manufacturers would `` devalue human life '' simply because they make these products knowing that people will die from their use/abuse . And the government would `` devalue human life '' by letting these companies operate under it . We do not go targeting innocent civilians . More often than not , the civilians are killed by Iraqi suicide bombers or `` militia '' , and the few that are killed by the US are accidents .
Yes and no . I agree that civilized society must restrict certain behavior from time to time . However , a person 's right in choosing what is best for them is not something that should ever be restricted . If there are consequences for our actions , we should be prepared to accept them , either in the eyes of the law , or in that god fellow so many people talk about . What did he say ? Judge not lest ye be judged ? Now I do n't know if that god fellow is for real or not , but those sound like pretty good words anyway . There were some very learned people who wrote in the bible . It 's too bad that society has forgoten some of the lessons handed down to use over the last 2000 years .
Unfortunately , the only reason people have any issue with the subject is because of their religious beliefs . If it were not so , there would be no discussion upon the subject . I do n't think you can really ask this of people and expect it to make sense . Yeah , a lot of people are harmed , but mostly because of religion and moral beliefs . Without these beliefs there would be no opposition to gay marriges . Ugly , but true .
No , but I agree with him that we should all be able to find our own spirituality without the religious hound dogs tracking us down . I do n't think he would agree with how you and others approach the religious posts in this forum either . Even though I do n't agree with everything I read of him , which is not much , I do think he 's on the right track . I hope he can find the answers he 's looking for . Who knows , he may even be able to find a cure for stupid .
So geology is a religion because we were n't here to see rock X formed ?
Much of history is cyclical . I am unaware of evolution being mapped in such the same manner .
Do n't pray for us ! Debate with us ! Are all your posts so pointless ?
Could be .
Attack ? Au Contraire ! I admire the FAITH of all the Athiests I have ever encountered on the New York Times , and The Atlantic . Is your Faith threatened ? Now what could be better than having a common source , in this book , and anyone can buy it and read it , and discuss it here ! ! ! Ah , Liberty and Justice for all ! Well , two books are required , or suggested , Geisler 's and the Bible . Enjoy the DISCUSSION folks !
OMG . Here we go again . Please tell us on what basis the state is better able to determine the future of a woman 's pregnancy than she herself is . What theory of law would you use to support your point ? Hypothetical situation : Roe is overturned , returning control over abortion to the states . State `` A '' bans abortions ; state `` B '' permits them under most circumstances . 1 . What sanction does State `` A '' put in place to punish those who have abortions within its borders ? Upon whom is the sanction applied ? The woman ? The doctor ? 2 . How does state `` A '' prevent its citizens from traveling to state `` B '' to have the abortion performed ? 3 . How will state `` A '' determine that one of its citizens has traveled to state `` B '' to have the abortion performed ? 4 . Can state `` A '' punish one of its citizens for traveling to state `` B '' to have a legal act performed on her ? 5 . By what claim of right is any man entitled to an opinion on the question ? After you finish those , Joel , I have a few more for you .
Fuel for the fire , talk about taking an opportunity and try to work it to your advantage.And I was under the assumption it was because he was a muslim terrorist or was affiliated with said . So now the Brady are going to run with it and say mentally incapacitated or mentally incompetent. Another ploy to keep guns away from returning soldiers . Not one word there about the shooter being Muslim or anything else just mentally incapacitated or mentally incompetent.
And neither can millions of other heterosexuals , something you ignore . As for nature , technically anything that occurs ever without supernatural causes is in fact in nature . We are a part of nature . Everything we do is a part of nature . Therefore , by taking the genetic data of two gays , placing it in a egg and having a surrogate mother bring it to term , gays can reproduce themselves .
That 's the thing . JPSartre12 ca n't point to anything inaccurate , so you see this mundane complaint that *you 're posting something I do n't like* ... Quite frankly , if Christianity insists on trying to tell the government how it should perform marriages , I think that street should cut both ways and the government should be able to have input on how religion performs marriages ... JPSartre12 's reply is reflective of the *anti-gay Christians are seeking discrimination against gays , but we 're going to try to pretend we 're the real victims while we bash them* school of thought .
Why is that the belief . If a guy rapes a woman , there is some sort of power thing involved . He is n't interested in her as anything else other than a thing to controll . Only an XXXXX would assume that it 's automatically her fault .
forgetaboutit . Hey , it 's Memorial Day weeeekeend and the sun is shining . I think I 'll go outside and play .
That 's one problem . Creationism ( christian ) is n't the only other `` viable '' ( if you call it that ) system of origin . ( well , evolution is the only viable on in real , but to further the conversation ) , There are many others . Christianity is only one religion , and it 's not even the largest one . All religions have equally `` valid '' systems of origin . ALl of these religions , however , are hopelessly mythical and subjective . Most people set up a bifurcation ; they do n't realise that christianity 's creationism is n't the only other option .
Well said ! The problem is that anti-choicers are busy bodies and do n't respect anyone else 's decisions . If they did , there would n't be a problem .
Well obviously it has to be something . Its not the mother , its its own being . Hence , it is some sort of living thing . All living things have to be part of a species . Is the species A potential human ?
Sometimes God allows Satan to cause suffering to His people and to Christians in order for them to grow stronger and as a form of punishment . Note that God did n't decide he wanted the Israelites to suffer on the spur of the moment . It was their constant disobedience that put them in the situtations they were in .
Yes , that is interesting . There are some same-sex couples who are legally married , while other same-sex couples can not marry in California . An interesting issue .
Welcome my friend ... ... ... ... We can always use another pro life advocate ... ... .Looking forward to your input ... ... ... .
Well , this comes from the same people who invented the death pannels . The truth is that all the developed countries ( all of Europe , Canada , Japan , Australia , New Zealand , Taiwan , Israel ) have universal healthcare . Their COST per capita is about half of ours . They have better outcomes . Universal healthcare has been tried in many places and it does work . What does not work is our current system . Wellpoint has just increased premiums by 30 % even wiyhout a reform bill . They spend 30 % on administrative costs . BTW , do you oppose the bill that would force them to limit the administrative costs to 20 % ?
And some of us are so hung up on stereotyping , emotionally charged rhetoric that they will never be able to accomplish one thing to address the abortion issue .
And its all evolved via NDS - marvellous !
Many natural disasters such as tornados , destructive flood , severe drought probably have something to do with global warming . I do n't know which is first regarding these combinations . Maybe flood is caused due to global warming , maybe reverse . These phenomena are related each other , so it ca n't be seperated when we think about it . Maybe global warming itself is not such a big threat but many disadvantages resulting from this are threats to us .
Biologically speaking , the fetus is human ; the mother person is simply sustaining it via blood -- just like via mother 's milk after birth . Can she legally starve the newborn child of that ( if no other suitable nourishment is available ) simply because she has the `` right to her body ? '' I think no , by law .
So if Utah made a law or a governor stated that christians did n't need protection because of their beliefs even if there were incidents of anti chrisitan beating and harassment let alone murder for their beliefs you would just say let states have their own laws ?
And yet all you do is present your own opinions without supporting facts .
Apology accepted . I kind of figured you did n't .
k
That settles the matter .
oh do n't kid yourself , you people were miserable long before I got here . Darwinists ' arrogance is astounding .
Exactly . Most people would incorporate it , from childhood most often . Steeeeve ca n't seem to wrap his mind around that .
Actually , everything the bible say 's belies your `` atheist answer '' . The reality is that the world itself and all of Gods Creation speaks to His existence as being self evident . It takes a degree of faith to accept Jesus as our personal Savior , but as far as accepting the reality of God Himself , all one need do is look observe the world we live in to see that only an incredible and loving God could create such a Beautiful and marvelous World with so many amazing symbiotic and perfectly interdependent forms of life .
Actually `` I do n't know '' is quite a valid answer in science . However , again you slip into this false construct of a belief that all that can be known is in the scope of science ; which you 've also denied saying you believe in the past . [ quote=Montalban ] Is this a rational statement ? If so , prove it rationally , by science .
Well , let 's be honest here . People fear gay marriage , not that it might come about via judicial fiat . That 's just the current whipping horse because that 's how it happened first , for some broad values of judicial fiat of course . There was a recent post here about rights granted gays by their state legislature , Oregon I think , and a group jumped in and forced the law on hold via a petition drive . So it really is n't the means by which gays get equality that upsets some folks , it 's the equality itself . `` judicial fiat '' is just a phrase people can use so they can avoid stating their true motives , preventing gays from being treated as equals .
evidently not . You have been unable to present me with any scientific evidence that mutations can create the raw material for which natural selection ( which also does n't exist ) would act . This renders your theory scientifically worthless and more along the lines of astrology or palm reading .
Yes , it does . But determining that age is not a question answered by evolution .
Which again provides no evidence of creationism .
? ? What are you trying to say ? Science is knowledge , all knowledge , that is , anything we find to be true . There is no other `` truth '' out there , if there were , we 'd be omniscient .
Archie , the ONLY issue that gays do n't have a majority support for gay equality on is gay marriage . That 's it . Laws against sodomy ? Majority oppose them . Laws against gay adoption ? Majority oppose them . Laws against gays in the military ? Majority oppose them . Hate crime legislation for gays ? Majority supports them . ENDA ? Majority support . Even CIVIL UNIONS has a majority support . But you are too swept up in your self-assumed superiority to recognize when you are standing alone ... I am laughing at the fact that you are fighting against people who comment on SOME Christian actions against gays , but then you EXUDE the very thing we are talking about . You become a living example . Quite frankly Archie , I think you are a thorough embarrassment to most of the other anti-gay posters on these threads . Comparing gays to al Qaeda ? And I thought Robertson and Falwell were when they tried to associate gays as a cause to the issue of 9/11 .
Now , now ZSU , we learned from comrade star gazer that GW created the Continental Army . I am sure these gentlemen have some equally illogical and inaccurate 'facts ' to scatter around the barnyard
I know this would be somewhat of a drain on your time but I think it would be helpful if you would make a short post at the end of each post stating how much time the next poster has , what post number this is , how many are left , any comments concerning going outside the rules , etc .
Why do you place value on human life ?
YES ! the founding fathers realized government was to serve the people it governed . With out a set of rules that limited the government it would run wild ( as england did ) . They made the bill of rights and constitution so that it would limit the government ( to keep it from becoming too powerful , and overstepping it 's bounds ) . And the only way the constitution could actually be enforced was for the population to uphold it . Back in the time of it 's writing they probably saw the best way for a population to force a government to not over step it 's bounds was to force it ... er ... by force . Today in the information age , a much better weapon is our right to vote . Sweeping changes can be implemented with out the use of force using the system .
There are several scientific explanations for the nature of the earth . Some use 'science ' to say that the world is flat . Granted that these beliefs are n't widely accepted , but then not all religions are widely accepted . By your reasoning or 'logic ' you must ask yourself about whether you should rely on science when there are many different scientific theories . The Flat Earth News , at least back then , had a regular column , `` One Hundred Proofs Earth is Not a Globe . '' ( go to http : //www.flat-earth.org/ ) Other theories taught as science phrenology alchemy evolution eugenics neptunism Theories of the Aether Articles relating to the Emergence of Scientific Theories of the Cosmic Aether ( http : //www.mountainman.com.au/aether.html ) What about 'metascience ' ? http : //www.calresco.org/lucas/science.htm Or , sciences used to support political ends ... What about Marxist Science http : //www.marxists.org/archive/hald ... philosophy.htm or Chaos Theory and Marxism http : //www.marxist.com/science/chaostheory.html There 's Nazi Science http : //www.webster.edu/~woolflm/naziscience.html Nationalist Science http : //www.ljudmila.org/nettime/zkp4/08.htm Or social ends ... Scientific Racism http : //www.press.uillinois.edu/f02/tucker.html Mainstream scientists instead of using the word 'heretic ' use the word 'pseudo-science ' to categorise fringe beliefs .
None of the 'fishersci ' links would take , but I did get a look at the fibre optic systems . Will try again later .
Actually , I reported the real results of a study . Regular church attendees are twice as likely to vote Republican ... etc. , the conclusion was , however , meant to be a joke . Most got it , you did n't .
You mean that it must have has a beginning , do n't you ?
I 'm sorry , but your entire rant is nothing but ignorance based fear mongering . From YOUR ARTICLE :
Actually I 'm so sure of my manhood that even though I knew that charge would be levelled against me I still posted anyway . Anyway if you feel that men need to be degraded to make up for past actions to women you have gone from `` righteous '' to bitter .
No . We know that evolution happens . What would be a problem would be to find the processes that made evolution happen as such incredible rates . There is n't any evidence that it can happen that fast .
No , not really . All that is different is the number of steps . What is YOUR definition of 'macro-evoution ' ? Is it speciation ? Or is it a brand new genus ? We have observed speciation , where new species happened .
Logical truths do not come from `` somewhere '' , your question makes as much sense as `` What time is a moose ? `` . You do not appear to have read my post at all , variously repeating what I have said and addressing things I did not say .
Really ? Why ca n't you `` disprove '' what it actually is instead of someone 's explanation of it ? It 's a standard scientific tool , the procedure is well documented . If you can `` prove '' that it 's wrong somehow you should be able to do it right off the bat , you should n't need to be primed with someone 's explanation .
Really ? How do you explain this picture ? http : //www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comd ... /hominids2.jpg I 'm really interested .
Where to start with this proposal ? First such a plan could lead to DC style gun control where you could only own a handgun if it was registered with the city , and then they could immediately halt any and all registration at any time , creating a de facto ban . Then there 's the fact that supporters of gun control have argued that gun owners should be required to pay a fee for each gun they register , and that the registration process should be something that needs to be repeated every single year , and the fee paid every time as well . Then there was the proposal over in Pennsylvania where an officer would be allowed to deny registration for any reason , meaning automatic forfeiture of your weapons due to the `` only registered guns are legal guns '' policy that certain people embrace like the holy scripture . And then there 's the fact that registration leads to confiscation . We 've seen it happen as recently as 12 years ago , we know it 's the outright truth . Not long after the New York spree killing , the newspaper covering the proposal of gun licenses needing to be renewed every five years explicitly stated that if the registration lapsed the guns would be confiscated . And then there 's the fact that registration databases are nothing more than money pits that serve no crime fighting benefits , Canada has stated such . Any attempt at a database is going to waste taxpayer money , take police off the streets , and require police to prosecute honest people for paperwork errors rather than going after gang members and other criminals . Oh and then we come to the fact that criminals will never register their weapons , leaving them untraceable !
Not really when you consider the gun laws of the UK , and how they were changed to prevent incidents like Cumbria from ever happening .
So , you 're saying that you believe in absolutely everything your church believes and you support everything it does and the moment it did anything oustide of these you 'd leave right ?
No evidence of what ?
Perhaps an analogy . Lets say for the sake of the argument you do not smoke or drink ( personally against it , for whatever reason ) . However , you believe others should have the right to drink and smoke if they so choose . So , you are personally against drinking and smoking but you are `` pro-choice '' in that regard ( meaning you believe every person should make that determination for themselves ) . Pro-life would be : You do n't drink and smoke ( morally against it perhaps ) and you are going to make sure that no one else is able to either .
Quite frankly , you do n't know squat about me . So stop trying to pretend you do . I have gone on record to say I think Christianity does a lot of good in the world . I have even tried to correct Matthew in his anti-Christian tirades . ( Until I gave up realizing it would do no good ... ) I hate to break it to you , but the WORLD typically functions with people putting out negative news . You hear about how Joe Blow broke the law . Do you ever hear about how Johnny Atlas keeps the law ?
Do you think humans have the pinnacle of processing power and reason in our brain for the entire universe ? ( aside from god )
That 's not true -- actually , it does n't make sense . Science is just a bunch of rules ( by definition ) . `` Biology uses science to study life '' is true . `` Physics uses science to study the physical world '' is true , but `` science 's purpose is to study life '' is not true .
No , genesis is not a history lesson . It is a combination of 'just so ' stories , and a religious message in allegory format . If you bothered to learn understand some of the hebrew puns behind many of the words , and also see the political commentary of events that were happening during the time it was written , that would be obvious .
And I 'm addressing your counter-arguments in that regard . One of those counter arguments has been that both chimps and ourselves had four billion years to evolve to our level of intelligence and that during all that time we were subject to the same ecological pressures . Neither of those statements is accurate . The first is misleading for the reasons outlined above , and the second is simply false : humans have experienced greatly different ecological challenges since we diverged from chimps . I 'll finish up tomorrow - battery dead .
Well , it seems pretty evident that you have know idea of the meaning of the word theory when used in science .
A textbook description of a liberal !
actually , it can be proven whether leprechauns , unicorns , the flying spaghetti monster , magical space monkeys and livining care baers , and even god , exists or not . the question of proving a belief seems kinda self-contradictory to me . if something is a fact that can be proven , then your belief about it is irrelevant . likewise , if you believe something , whether there are facts to support it or not , its still your belief . there are people who believe things inn the absence of supporting facts , and sometimes even in the face of opposing facts . the term for that is faith faith is the belief of something in the absence of evidence . if you have faith in something , proof is irrelevant , or at least it should be
I 'm not sure what you are saying . Are you saying that you think that theropod dinosaurs should have more feathers than this Sinornithosaurus does ? First you claim that the entire forelimb would have been useless , and when shown that it was not you claim that the feathers could not have existed because they would be useless , and now when shown a fossil that shows feathers , you are surprised that there are not more . I suspect that not all of the feathers on this creature are apparent in the fossil . http : //research.amnh.org/vertpaleo/feather5.jpg http : //research.amnh.org/vertpaleo/feather9a.jpg http : //research.amnh.org/vertpaleo/feather11.jpg But there are enough to show that feathered dinosaurs did , in fact exist . Any argument about whether or not is is possible that such creatures existed is moot . It is irrelevant that you feel that such limbs would have been useless . Obviously they were not . So now we return to your original confused and erroneous arguments .
The Polar Icecaps have been melting for the past 14,000 years according to experts . Many in the scientific community believe that it would be another 100-1000 years before the melting of Polar Ice becomes a factor in the rise of sea level . What they believe is more important is the thermal expansion of the world 's water that comes with the increase in the oceans ' mean temperature . Some predict that the rise in sea level could be 3 ' by 2100 , so do n't invest long-term in any beach-front property that is n't on tall stilts and you 'll be OK .
That is the declaration of independence not the constitution . I can go you one better admendment 9 and 10 talk about certain rights retained by the people . Amendment IX The enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people . Amendment X The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people . The conservatives would argue that by offering same sex marriage that their persute of happiness is denied by gay people even existing and that they have to look at us .
Right . That certainly explains the many , many versions of Christianity .
The claim that only through a belief in the Biblical God - or any God - can right and wrong be known is completely stupid . 1 ) Ever hear of humanism ? 2 ) EVEN CHIMPS HAVE A SENSE OF BEING TREATED RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY ! AND EVEN CHIMPS HAVE BEEN SEEN TO DO FOR OTHERS WHAT THEY WOULD WANT DONE FOR THEM ! EDIT : Excuse , I double checked and I was wrong ... but that 's BAD news for the Creationist ! EVEN CAPUCHIN MONKEYS - WHICH ARE NOT AS RELATED TO HUMANS AS ARE CHIMPS - HAVE A SENSE OF WHETHER THEY ARE BEING TREATED FAIRLY OR NOT ! ! ! http : //www.sciencedaily.com/releases ... 0918092951.htm Chimps take this one step farther by adding into the mix how closely their social bonds are to the other participant . So chimps have a more complex sense of fairness than do capuchin monkeys . http : //www.whsc.emory.edu/press_rele ... nt_id_seq=2819
My stance on morality is based on the following observations : 1 . `` I '' for me means my mental self , with my physical self just tagging along . 2 . I do not wish to suffer or to have those I care about suffer . 3 . I feel empathy toward others and often feel sorry for the suffering of others . Those are observations , not proclamations . The way I choose a moral code to avoid the problem of suffering is to essentially make a theoretical deal with others to have a mutual moral code that we will all treat each other as we ourselves would be treated - in this way , all of us can win out and I solve my problem of points 2 and 3 . Perhaps there are other better ways of finding a solution for societies to avoid suffering , but I have n't heard of one . I did not choose this solution arbitrarily . I chose it since it makes sense and should theoretically work and since many , if not most people , at least make some effort at using that moral code anyway so this moral code is at least partially universally adopted . It is the best moral option I have ever heard to address my concern about suffering . What is arbitrary about the reasoning I presented above ? What unsupported proclamations do you claim that I have made ? Either way , are you proposing that all moral systems are equally arbitrary and therefore equally valid ? In your scenario , someone could come up with an arbitrary proclamation `` black people should be slaves to white people '' and build a morality based on that . My moral approach questions that proclamation as well and thus avoids un-necessary human suffering .
Leaving aside for a moment the false construct you 're arguing against you should read up ... The Pseudo-Problem of Creation in Physical Cosmology by Adolf Grünbaum http : //www.infidels.org/library/mode ... m/problem.html `` As Bondi sees it , the steady-state theory propounded by himself and Thomas Gold in 1948 brings `` the problem of creation . . . within the scope of physical inquiry '' ( Ibid . ) Although some theories are deemed defunct , such as the one above , your assumptions about such things being outside the scope of science is flawed .
Not really . That 's the fallacy of exclusion of the middle . Because there are only two choices , if one is wrong somehow , the other is therefore correct . The problem is that there is n't only two choice for sure . Besides , science is wrong all the time , it does n't prove that creation is right . In fact , for instance , science estaimtes of moon dust have been proven wildly wrong , and those corrections actually harm creation .
So why is it a white man ca n't just think himself black , or vice versa ?
But that does n't help much with calculating the length of a day from actual astronomical observations . Perhaps if we told Freeofthought that the current rate of slowing of the earth is 0.005 sec/year/year . I have no doubt that Freeofthought will misunderstand that number - it is a rate . Just assume that rate has been unchanging even though it has n't been . A lot of the creationists misunderstanding comes from remarks like the following .
I dunno , I keep seeing more and more chinese around here ! ! And they all have 3 kids ! They come over here just so they can breed . They invade a host that is more favorable for replication . Viral ! [ please , this is a joke , any chinese out there , just a joke ! ]
Not the way I see it from my experiences . I let the readers decide on their own .
The interesting thing about the 'quality of life ethic ' is that , in a pro-choice framework , it means that we ca n't degrade anyone 's quality of life without their permission . So far from entailing a cull of the elderly , the infirm , the handicapped , and the ugly , the quality of life ethic entails that we can not kill them off . Each person is entitled to the quality of life that they desire where what they desire does not infringe on other 's quality of life .
If humans are parasites can I kill you because parasites have no worth .
You know , that is one aspect of the story that no one ever seems to focus on when refuting the flood . I think it is an excellent extra point of refutation of the whole ridiculous story .

Pregnancy is n't expensive at all unless you 're conned into thinking it has to be . If it were , poor people could n't have the kids they do . Medical costs can be paid for by others . It 's the luxuries many yuppy types seem to think they need that makes the after effects costly . In most cases of putting a pregnancy up for adoption , there is NO cost incurred to the mother .
Right on ! A real man supports those he loves , through thick and thin . He does n't try and control the things he ca n't either . In the end , it 's not a man 's decision . It is not his body , therefore , he has no right to make the ultimate decision . He can only express his view . That 's about it . ( I 'm pretty sure it 's not any easier for her to decide ) . So cudos to those men .
Only approximate and really depends upon what day you start counting , before or after menses .
Actually Archie it was neither left nor right . he went after both democrat and republican and took a center tone to the entire issue at hand . Portraying the reality of the suffering of his hometown due to jobs leaving the US and the greed on wall street .
Being new is n't a problem . Nor is uncertainty about a position . The way to learn is to ask questions in appropriate places . However , a problem with message boards is that , without experience , it may be difficult to tell who is speaking from knowledge and who is speaking from ignorance or faith .
Well , their cash cow dried up and even Toby Hoover is going to have to get a new gig . No matter how many times these dire warnings were given they just never came to pass and over 2/3rds of the people are wise to them now and they have lost any credibility at all . Folks all over are now standing up demanding their rights and the left has expended both it 's money and political and emotional capital . Stick a fork in them Lucy , they are done
So parthenegenic births are always female . Where did the X chromosome come from ? Is this another case of `` POOF , it was a miracle '' when faced with reality ?
So have I , since I know that evolution has and does take place . But I catch it from both sides because I dont believe the scientific explanation of the origins of life or the beginning of intelligent awareness .
So police who are not military and are civilians , unless you are paid by the DOD and come under the geneva Convention you are a civilian period . If you had of paid attention , you should know that it is not the `` standing army '' that is fighting the current wars , it is oath taking militia/civilians from the State National Guards and reserve forces who have taken the same oath many of us have , to protect the Constitution from all enemies both domestic and foreign . That is not to say that only those people are the militia either ! Can you name one successful government that has ever won a guerrilla war ? Russia fought in Afghanistan for how long before it limped back home ?
See above .
And yet there are plenty of websites written by scientists with the details :

But would you understand what I was talking about if I referred to AL 288-1 , Trinil 2 , Sangiran 17 , KNM-ER 1813 , OH 13 , KNM-WT 15000 , or Saccopastore 1 ? You know so little that you do n't even realize that the names to which you object are not scientific names but names popularized by the press for people , like you , who know so little about it . Scientifically , both Java Man and Peking Man are Homo erectus . They are classified as such because there are no significant differences between them . In fact , there is little difference between Java Man ( Trinil 2 ) and the skull of Nariokotome Boy ( KNM-WT 15000 ) , from Africa , or KNM-ER 3733 for that matter . But you are obsessed with the words . You are so bent out of shape because transitional species between ape-like ancestors and us , that walked upright and used tools are called `` man '' . And they are n't assumed to be ancestral . Why do n't you learn what you are talking about before you speak . You make yourself look foolish when you speak from ignorance . ] quote ] Regarding the Java Man , How is this skull cap evidence of anything concrete ? [ /quote ] How is it that you think that evidence against your mythology based point of view supports your mythology ?
Since they are issued by the military I would think so .
So I am not intitled to my opinions ? Your statement is so ironic because it seems that others also suffer from pot and kettleism and do n't realize it .
Just as you were stating that it was not as an example , so was I stating that it was to me as an example . So , your reasoning that we can know if it is or is not a person is because people disagree on whether or not it is ? That theory could use a bit more explanation .
Oh never mind that such a condition would be toxic ... not to mention that no ice cores support such magical ideas .
You do not have a right to drive . No one does . Driving is not a right . The state does not owe it to you to give you a license to drive . The activity of driving is a priveldge granted by the state , not a right . Rights are not regulated by government . You have them and no earthly authority can take it away from you . The state never gave me my rights , I already had them , nor do I have to ask for permission to exercise them .
And there are plenty of people who smoke who do n't develop lung cancer . You 're cherry picking .
this statement is n't logical . It does not follow that if the person who creates the laws has to therefore follow them or ca n't change them ... or even that they apply to him . If a teacher says `` no talking in the classroom '' it does n't apply to the teacher now does it .
There 's no adding of firearms going on , because they 're already there ! The criminals have them , that 's a hard fact of life that ca n't ever be changed . Deal with it . What we want is for the intended victims to be on equal footing with the bad guys . There 's nothing unreasonable about that .
Many of the gun hating crowd also own guns . It 's the elitism belief , that they 're superior to all humans and thus deserve to be armed , while everyone else in the world should be unarmed and bow before them as if they 're gods .
I 'm glad you made the same correlation I did . ToE is a substitute for # # # # in this case .
But common descent is your word Peeling . And this is what gets so frustrating about debating with you because you 're as slippery as the evolution you debate . And you can also be somewhat sanctimonious in you attitude also . So let 's just get down to the built in contradictions that you constantly go between promoting and denying , depending on the arguments I give at any time . Here you are accusing me of wrongly lumping these other sciences in with evo as if I 'm trying to confuse the situation , but here : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_descent with the definition of common descent it say 's , This theory is now generally accepted by biologists , and the last universal common ancestor ( LUCA or LUA ) , that is , the most recent common ancestor of all currently living organisms , is believed to have appeared about 3.9 billion years ago . The theory of a common ancestor between all organisms is one of the principles of evolution , Does n't this aspect of common descent clearly imply that since the earliest organisms appeared 3.9 billion years ago and we descended from them commonly that they are tied together with the separate science you now refer to as abiogenesis ? Now go on and squirm out of that in your usual way Peeling .
You have ignored a third option , my denier of all that is right and good . That third option is the one you atheists and secular humanists refuse to consider , and that is that God spoke the stars into creation at the same time as Genesis says He spoke everything into existence in 6 days time as Genesis declares . What is dishonest and deceptive about your position is to then extrapolate from that info that it is God who is being deceptive . It is like saying that because you reject the gospel of Jesus as I accurately and honestly share it with you , that it is me lying about that gospel because you have rejected it . It is the most irrational and dishonest reasoning possible , yet it defines the way your minds work .
So essentially the good thing about religion is that it poses a question that may or may not be completely meaningless and then invents a happy-making answer to satisfy the curiosity thus engendered ? Wow , that 's so much more profound than eradicating smallpox .
How do you know he was a gun owner ? Maybe he borrowed it . And I bet he was a carnivore , walked upright and drove a car , as well .
So the local police did respond .
And I think that if I fall off a tall cliff , I 'll die . Does that mean that gravity and science are either evil or incorrect ?
So country by country , the world is going to hell in a hand basket . And this pleases you , why ?
He was barred for presenting hard evidence against the Big Bang . Observable evidence . He was the head astronomer at Mt Carmel not just another astronomer . He was our best one . Being barred from the telescopes he was in charge of , being fired , and having to move to Germany is not what you consider suppression ? I am not willing to discuss this with you anymore if you refuse to do it honestly . You can say anything .
I 'm not big on the abortion issue , but are you saying that anyone who disagrees with you is sexist and arrogant ? That 's a tactic straight from the leftist playbook . Clearly you 're the one who 's arrogant , if you can make these kinds of baseless generalizations of your opponents . Is n't it you who always accuses conservatives of being intolerant of people who think differently than them ? Now that 's irony !
In what universe is there a right to murder ? Unfortunately , we in the United States have only recently recognized that abusing children and owning slaves is not a right . And , only recently have women enjoyed the right to vote in the United States . What certain activities are forbidden in public ? Some of the conservative red states have only recently decreed that there should be speek limits . Not for safety reasons , of course . And , George Walker Bush has guaranteed the right of corporations to dump dangerous chemicals into lakes and rivers and the oceans .
And statistically a school massacre by someone with a concealed carry permit is just short of being nonexistent , but that fact still does n't mean a thing to you .
it ca n't always be cared by anyone . What if no one wants the baby or you ca n't get to a place where you can give the baby up ( maybe snowed in for a week ) . Can you kill the baby then because it is now dependent on you .
And justifiably . If you do n't see the problem , then you are the problem . The proposed revisions is typical YEC banter about `` evolution is a theory '' - without making it clear what a theory is . `` Teach all sides of the question . '' That 's code for teaching `` creation theory '' or ID . Does that mean that in geography class the teachers should present a flat earth as a reasonable alternative ? How about the earth as the center of the universe ? No ? I am all for teaching well supported theories that are not in agreement with the mainstream , but ID or creationism are n't them .
From a book review of BETTER FOR ALL THE WORLD : The Secret History of Forced Sterilization and America 's Quest for Racial Purity by Harry Bruinius : http : //www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/bo ... w/26satel.html Hmmm , Teddy Roosevelt , Winston Churchill , the Rockefeller foundations , millions of Americans , the State of Indiana . . . all these embraced the concept of EUGENICS . Interesting , yes ?
If you truly believe this then I think you need to re-read your posts and put yourself in the shoes of those on the receiving end .
Depends on which cell you mean . Mammalian red blood cells , for example , have had their entire nuclei and mitochondria removed . Not so much as a smidgeon of DNA .
No it 's not . Would n't it be nice if you knew enough to differentiate between theory , evidence and definition . [ /quote ] Ha ! Now , however , genes are `` losing their glitter . `` [ /quote ] I was n't aware that they glittered . What are you talking about ?
So , you got your tubes tied because `` With womens right 's getting shredded in the debate over abortion , fewer and fewer women are going to want to even risk have sex with men at all . It 'll cause a wave of abstinence and imprisonment that will cut succesive generations in half . That 'll even further errode the solvancy of social security . '' Why would one get their tubes tied if they were swearing off men ? And do you really believe the rest of the load about imprisonment and SS solvancy erosion , too ?
There are few `` Creo 's '' in this forum because it becomes very quickly apparent to them that they ca n't defend their belief in mythology . They find out that they have been misinformed and that they are scientifically illiterate . They realize that they have no evidence or proof , only statements of religious faith . That 's why they leave . They make statements like , `` radiocarbon dating is inaccurate because it is based on assumptions . '' Creationists are unwilling to examine their beliefs with the same skepticism as they direct at science . By the way , when asked for evidence you quite rudely responded that you would furnish it when you were good and ready . If you wished to be treated with respect , then would n't it have been better to explain that your material was n't available but you would find it and post it as soon as it was - say next Tuesday ? Instead you copped an attitude and responded with snide remarks . You invited the disrespect because you gave none . You are rude and verbally abusive and then play the martyr when you are mocked . We 've seen it before . Your behaviour is quite typical of creationists in general , but especially those who ca n't back up their assertions . [ edit to add ] Here 's how science works . A scientist makes an observation of some natural event or the effects of some natural event that he/she does n't understand . Drawing on experience and current theory in that field of science , the scientist formulates a speculative explanation due to natural causes . This is called an hypothesis . If the scientist were to declare , `` It 's a miracle ! '' then that would shut off all inquiry and place the assertion beyond challenge . That would be giving up . It is important that the hypothesis is open to challenge , that is to say , it must be falsifiable . The scientist then makes a prediction of some potential observation that is a logical requirement of the hypothesis . In other words , the predicted observation must be true if the hypothesis is the correct explanation . This is what I meant when I spoke of predictive value above . The scientist then designs and carries out an experiment that tests whether the observation can be made exactly as predicted . If the scientist is correct , then he publishes his hypothesis in an appropriate scientific journal where his work is evaluated and the testing can be repeated . Sometimes further predictions are made and tested . If the experimentation shows that the hypothesis is n't correct , then it is amended to account for the new experimental data and the process is repeated with further predictions and tests . Sometimes the hypothesis is abandoned entirely . I certainly hope that your `` proof '' has been subjected to the kind of challenge that scientific theories undergo . Science advances by being challenged . Religion does n't advance and challenges have resulted in burning at the stake , torture and death .
So if an atheist believes that humans are the highest form of intelligence , and a devout Christian believes God is the highest form of intelligence , the Christian should allow the atheist to force him to behave as if humans are the highest form of intelligence ?
Well for what it 's worth , the police prefer to use AR-15 Carbines , MP-5 9mms , and either Mossberg or Remington 12ga when they are serving a no-knock warrant on your house ( or the wrong house next door ) in the middle of then night . And the AK may be a bit much for home use , as the 7.62 would way over-penetrate the walls and hit the neighbors houses ( or the neighbors . ) Hope that helped .
I think I posted that awhile ago . Its huge BS . Thats like saying `` Civil rights hurt blacks '' . Even though abortion may have some unwated side affects , its no where near the emotional and physical pain and suffering for the rest of your life than a forced pregnancy . Just goes to show that the pro-life movement is desperate .
but they do support the choice to abort a fetus or embryo . An argument made for slavery was that `` you do n't have to own them but do n't tell us what to do '' ..a fairly similar argument but does n't show whether or not abortion is wrong just that some lines of thinking should be questioned .
Evidentally , closed-mindedness exists left of center .
You know something is wrong with this world when people start calling embryos and non-sentient life forms victims and referring to martin Luther King Jr. to justify their views . It seems today that anyone that shows any decency or slight intelligence or common sense is labeled a radical leftist . Man , the republicans are getting desperate when you see them trying to equate embryos to men using MLK .
Well you can get injured very badly playing baseball , you can get killed ( just the other day some high school coach took a batting practice ball right in the head and died ) . And I have not heard a single person say that pregnancy is something no one should have to go through . I know I do n't . And yes people sometimes do force a woman to get pregnant , it 's called rape .
But does n't Genesis imply that creation occured in one 7-day period ( though the days could be symbollic ) ?
I believe that a number of issues are to be considered in regard to a pregnant woman 's health . How damaging to her health would continuation of the pregnancy be ? What sort of family responsibilities does she have ? Most women , it seems , have family responsibilities of one sort or another , as opposed to men who tend to let family responsibilities go by the wayside . Is she the breadwinner of the family ? If she 's disabled , what will happen to her family ? I hate it when men , I presume that most of the trivializers are men , when men trivialize the issue of a woman 's health . And we very well know that McCain has little use for women . He is a supreme user of women . He married his first wife for her beauty and discarded her when she lost that beauty . He married his next wife for her beauty and wealth but did not hesitate to call her the C word and denounce her for a trollop for putting on so much makeup . The woman is no longer the youthful beauty she once was , so why should n't she use make-up if that pleases her ? McCain has repeatedly demonstrated he hates women :
I think a free society works better by saying `` You have to have at least a certain variety to give your customers a choice in products '' . Businesses should have the restrictions , not private citizens .
This says absolutely nothing about gays . It talks about Congress investigating Science and Ethics . Quite frankly , I think some of the people they NEED to be investigating is NARTH , as I just proved that their article MISQUOTED other research articles . Furthermore , I can supply you with a long list of other anti-gay researchers who likewise have been guilty of misrepresenting other people 's research . On a separate note , this article was further down on that web-page . It had this title : `` Federal Judge Dismisses Scientific Misconduct Claim ``
Well I think that god must be a bit confused since he also says ... . Now therefore kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him . But all the women children , that have not known a man by lying with him , keep alive for yourselves.  Numbers 31:17-18 He does n't seem to mind at least some retroactive abortions ... .
A master baiter like you should present your thesis to be taken seriously , you have n't and you are n't .
Oh no , I completely hit the point and exposed it for what it is . Your continuing to compare the ID concept to a flat earth belief proves my point even more . That and the fact that you referred to the flying spaghetti monster seven times in your last post .
And yet this is what they fossil record shows . There is alot of information floating around on the uses of feathers for insulation , hunting techniques , display etc before flight . Half a feather might not be as good for flight as a `` fully developed '' one , but dinosaurs had them and they probably were able to glide , albeit poorly , with them . Even less of a feather might shade a pool of water to allow them to spot small fish or for display to attract a potential mate . To say they were `` totally useless '' , is simply false . Evolution works on adapting already functional structures for different functions .
and tell me what did you gain out of making this statement ? Just to let you know ... the Bible ( if you would actually read it in context instead of reading a little portion that you want to and interpret it the way you want outside of its context ) .. teaches how to love ... because God is love.. and laid down his own life so that we could be FREE ! hmmm ... . sounds like the motto of what our troops do for our country ... they lay their lives down because they want us to be free ... where do you think this `` ideology '' comes from ? ? ?
** Sorry to hear you say this . I have never attacked you personally , never said anything like what you accuse me of saying . I have characterized certain ideas , notions , and opinions as stupid and simple-minded , but not you personally . If your personal identity causes you to believe that an attack on those ideas is an attack on you personally , than obviously what I 've been saying about your personal commitent and emotional involvement with materialist/mechanist/darwinist/atheism is spot on the money .
What is your point ?
I 'm not out Pentroll . Im indoors .
I 'm not against concealed carry in principle but open carry seems silly to me . I smell posers .
Just out of curiosity , what do you feel you could sue the company for ? Descrimination ? Could I sue Wal Mart or Dillons for not carrying a line of adult movies and sex toys ? After all , I have a right to own adult movies and sex toys . Does n't that mean that Wal Mart automatically has the responsibillity to provide those goods ? After all , they are the biggest retailer in my area .
First off , define `` government funded '' . The FBI ? The CIA ? Other federal law enforcement agencies ? The military ? All vital government entities that are and should be armed . The fact that governments around the world have killed their own citizens after disarming them does not mean that they should not be armed , it means that the citizens should not be disarmed . Think of what our country would have become over the last 100 years without an armed government .
There is a point , however , that the fetal lung is not mature enough to survive outside the womb even with mechanical assistance . So , unless our technology will be pretty radically different in the future , it is n't about getting it out , it 's about it not surviving when it is out .
No , neither am I suggesting that illegality makes something immoral . Legality and morality are completely separate things .
Actually , you have slipped into talking Bible here and seem to be refering to the miracle of Lazarus .
I believe I would know when my own post is sarcasm or not ...
I 'll take these questions ( one at a time ) in the other thread .
Those nasty deceptive Darwinians have been overthrown at last .
It 's ashame that everyone keeps looking for the judiciary to do the legislature 's work . When will the people press Congress to take up abortion ? It is the job of Congress after all , to address the issues desired by it 's constituents .
You still have n't learned what Google is have you Yankee Fan ? HowStuffWorks `` Artificial Life '' Artificial Life Likely in 3 to 10 Years - Science - redOrbit And relying entirely on insults is not a good way of gaining credibility . It did n't work on Livewire , it wo n't work here .
In the Declaration of Independence , Thomas Jefferson identifies the right to life as a fundamental freedom . If more gun-control saves lives then more gun-control means more freedom . Are n't you pro-gunners interested in freedom ?
I 've always gone the Scylla and Charybdis route before instead .
I agree ...
No it is n't . There was an incident here in the states last year that had an elderly woman beaten and raped , and several days later her rapist came back to do it again and she killed him on the spot . She was n't brought to court to face trial even know she killed someone . THAT is how something like this should be handled .
As an aside I do admire your way with words , bravo !
So you 're saying that the modern day militia no longer utilizes privately owned weapons ? In 1792 the militia made use of privately owned weapons and thus the federal government kept a record of privately owned weapons to determine its military readiness . `` These categories included privately owned small arms and accountrements to be reported to the federal government . These were , in most cases , individually owned private property ... .There was no outrage or even concern expressed then that an inventory of privately owned weaponry and accoutrements reported to the federal government would somehow 'infringe ' on the right of the people , '' http : //www.potomac-inc.org/milret.html `` The Militia Act was about military organization ... .The Militia Act of 1792 required the states to 'enroll' that is , registered gun owners for militia duty just as they had been registered for the King 's militia . ( See ... /196gnd.html and Kates in ... /196lrev.html ) . Registration of ownership and the reporting of private sales would shut down the illegal traffic in firearms and empower local jurisdictions to enforce their local rules and regulations . Registration also creates the mechanism to establish legal categories of gun ownership that could effectively disarm the lawless and the disloyal starting with the NRA 's 'armed citizen guerrillas . ' That is how we provide for our self-defense under law and government . '' http : //www.potowmack.org/398chest.html
Oh , well I 'm not saying that companies wo n't be paying more money in health insurance . My point is that allowing same-sex marriage does n't really change company policy . The company 's policy is currently based on the government 's definition of marriage . If the government simply allows more people to choose to classify themselves as married , the company may see more more married couples apply for jobs , and it may see more of its employees decide to become married . As it sees these things happening , it can feel free to change its policies as it sees fit . What I mean is that this ruling would not mandate the businesses to make any payments to facillitate a change ; all that would happen is a few more of its employees might begin to classify themselves as married and it might be a bit more likely that the company hires in a married person . There is no mandate sent out to the company , there is no change in company policy , and there is no payment that the company is dishing out . If as more married people show up in the workplace , the company decides to change its health care coverage , that is up to the company , but it is not mandated to make any change . Now maybe you can still classify this as an unfunded mandate , but I 'm not really so sure that it legally qualifies under the circumstances . Regardless , I 've been saying that its status as an unfunded mandate is irrelevant in determining whether it is right to agree with same-sex marriage or not ; the fact that companies might have to provide all couples with health care equally instead of only giving health care to couples based on the sex of those involved is a change worth making . Quite a few companies already do it , in fact .
And of course , the Vulgate
And here you reveal your prediliction for reading what you want to see into the words of others . I described materialism embracing new forces and phenomena which have withstood the rigors of the scientific method . I explicitly described science as a methodology , not a philosophy . You are wrong about me , WW , and the longer you pretend otherwise , the more time you 're going to waste on strawmen and the more chances I 'm going to get to make your arguments look silly . It 's up to you . Argue with me , or argue with the person you want me to be .
Because we view it as something much more than just a gravy train from the govt. , that 's why . For you it seems to be about the word , and the govt . saying `` oh , you use THAT term ( `` marriage '' ) , ok we recognize it . '' For us it 's about the commitment .
Your penultimate sentence sums this up well with the emphasis that I added . What you describe is sufficient 'proof ' for you to believe . Why ? Because you believe . Other than the Bible ( which is far from being an accurate historical textbook ) from where do you obtain the evidence of these prophets and their prophecies ? I am not discussing the God/Person of Jesus specifically . I am not discussing whether or not Jesus is the Son of God , who rose from the dead in atonement for our sins and the sins of the whole world . ( Which , incidentally , I believe . ) I am discussing the God of the Hebrews ( or any other god for that matter ) . To believe the prophesies of which you speak , one must have faith . To believe that Jesus actually rose from the dead and ascended into heaven , one must have faith . There is no physical evidence that I am aware of to indicate that it did happen the way the Bible said it happened ... except for in writings of human beings allegedly inspired by God . It takes faith to believe that those human beings were inspired by God . It takes faith to believe that what they describe actually happened the way they describe it . What I can say with certainty that can not be disputed as far as I 'm aware , is that whatever happened ... happened . If a woman named Mary was impregnated by the Holy Spirit and conceived a child that she named Jesus who was crucified , died and buried , only to come back to life three days later and ascend into heaven after 40 days ... then that 's what happened . I believe that 's what happened , but there 's no physical evidence to prove that 's actually what happened . It takes faith to believe .
Actually it should be easily to relate to VOR on this : he only argues with emotion . No facts , no evidence , no proof , just emotion .
Well then quit trolling , and start debunking the BS by providing links to cases that were solved by having a gun registry in place .
And the other website says they are working on `` over unity '' machines . You know , perpetual motion . http : //www.earthtech.org/about/index.html
Actually the benefits of stable , safe and loving homes for chilren are important to society . To deny gays and lesbians are indeed able to provide this is a flat out lie . I have directed you to the AAP report on gay parenting . I would suggest you actually read it .
I think we are all aware that abortion is a terrible thing . No-one is denying that . And contrary to what some people might think , there is nothing anyone could say to make ( most ) women undergoing an abortion feel any worse about it . Just like any traumatic situation , sometimes you might just need to talk to someone about it , make sure your head is in the right place . And yes , some abortion clinics do provide counseling , but as far as i know , all of them provide referrals to other organizations that do . Contrary to what some people might think , the employees at these clinics , for the most part , are caring , compassionate people .
Just making sure that everybody is aware of his evasion , misrepresentation , and dishonesty . I figured a good time to do that would be while he was accusing scientists of these things ... ( I figure it 's a damn good illustration when a paper 's author tells him to stop misrepresenting the paper , and he keeps doing it anyway . ) In fairness , being a creationist is n't necessarily an indicator of dishonesty ; there are plenty of creationists who are creationists simply because they are uneducated about the subject . Unfortunately , supersport is n't part of this group ; he has seen the evidence and is willfully ignorant of it .
I do n't see how this is not a debate about abortion . True , it 's become mildly less concrete , but that 's what happens when you try to get it right .
Well it all depends on who is going to determine `` right '' , is n't it ? Abortion is not math . There are no finite answers . Just a myriad of opinions which inevitable lead to either abortion is right or abortion is wrong . No different now then when Roe v Wade became law or any other times in history . I do like Aristotle 's take ; He taught that a fetus originally had a vegetable soul but he did n't say what kind of vegetable .
Granted
Well then what the devil are you moaning about then ? It 's not like Browning shot King , or actually made the rifle that was used or anything like that . Hell it was n't even a rifle made by the Browning company . There 's absolutely no connection between the two for you to be bitching about .
It wo n't . I 'd think any responsible parent with a teen under the age of 18 who has a sound relationship with that teen would discuss the possibility of her becoming sexually active ( a normal function in spite of some puritan attitudes ) and offer simple avoidance of possible pregnancy and abortion . Like vehicle insurance she may never need it , but going without either one is plain stupid .

You have the right to protect yourself , sure ... but some people take this to extremes . ( Maybe we will call them ... extremists..yeah thats it ) The people who stand up loudly screaming `` the only way you 'll ever get my gun is by to pry it from my cold dead fingers ... '' News for you . The way a lot of these militia types act , the general public fears them . This fear is doing more harm to the gun movement than anything else . I 'm not talking about someone who has a shotgun by his bed ready for John Q . Criminal to walk in , I keep my .40 by my bed . I 'm talking about anti-government militia types who think that they will one day be fighting Russians from their doorstep . You said something about my `` phobic rant '' ? Have you ever heard these paranoid people ?
Hi - May be good for the 2 children , your husband is helping you to raise ... But the child , whose life you ended before birth , you gave No-chance to ; so what 's this rationalization - only in 'your mind ' - re `` a 2nd . chance to make it right '' ? ? See you recognized & amp ; admit caving-in to `` dumb peer pressure '' before then compounding acts of irresponsibility . But your mother : 1 . She was `` ashamed '' - was she selfishly more concerned with herself ? , and what people would think of her ? , and you ? and the family ? - so , let 's just `` Quietly kill it '' ? and 2 . She was `` ready to kill me '' - right : 'Kill ! this ! baby ! , before I kill you ' - type-thing . great ; that 's a *lesson for Pro-life* not ! So your mother failed the *both of you* , bigtime ! - and while you ca n't change that part of your past , to a degree - much larger than you most likely realize , you are shaping your 2 current children 's life . And from your rationalizations ( about the baby you killed ) , the concern is that you model soul/mindfully for your children , good/honorable behavior . And you support them , in such choices ... - so how are you *Interacting with ... , Imprinting/Teaching* your 2 children now ? - giving them a chance at making better choices , you realize ... Annie
No Peeling , it would be , `` We proved it was possible to evolve as humans have , so why can only we do it ? '' Why has n't one other creature on Earth ever evolved to our level of sophistication in the same alleged 4 billion years that we have had to attain our level of evolution ? If evo is real , then it seems only right that it should touch all species equally and that all species that were n't forced into extinction , but survived and overcame the pressures they faced should have ended up in a similar evolved place that man has attained in 4 billion years . Unless of course that the science of evolution is a humanistic justification to explain our origins but has no basis in fact what so ever . And that is my claim and belief .
Does any part of the theory of evolution give an accounting of how we transitioned from quadruped movements of the ape to biped ?
So you think that people that express a different point of view than you are doing something illegal ? You must disagree with freedom of speech . You 're a scary guy .
You offer no positive evidence towards Creationism nor did you deny that the idea of Creationism as scientific was destroyed long ago .
Well , if they are already pointing a gun at me , I would n't have a chance to pull out a gun and shoot them . They would shoot me before I did that .
My apologies . The whole point : There is NO answer .
So what ? ? Who cares what the number of assumptions are ? What we care about is whether the idea is correct . And to determine whether it is correct , you have to have data , not counting assumptions .
The source/infinite determines the conversions/destruction or evolutions . Energy
They do n't live in an environment where such events are likely . At one time there were several species of hominini living at the same time . Evolution is more bushlike that ladder like . It just so happens that we are the only species that remains .
No , it does n't . It is an example of how one part of the theory of evolution works to effect changes in a population .
And we are preventing this how ?
Max has outed himself as a hillbilly who can not spell or incorporate correct punctuation . I wonder if this effects his ability to know what evidence is ? Apparently so since he believes man evolved . `` attacking in '' LOL ! Ray M .
So God gets to do these terrible things , but He gets a free pass because He 's God ? Kinda funny what happens when you show Archie that the Bible does n't even support his beliefs , is n't it guys ? I still like the fact that the Bible says not to count children under one month of age as persons , yet here Archie expects us to count a zygote as `` a human life . ''
No , not in the least . It 's real intent was to throw a bone to the people pretending to have `` family values '' . The religious right , the conservatives , that lot .
I do n't see why it is so hard to accept he lied . He lost is award and lost his job over his data .
Really ? A human can be determined scientifically . Personhood is a human legal construct . You can not prove scientifically what a `` person '' is .
If the child is to be born into a poverty stricken part of the world and is expected to die by the age of 7 by either disease or lack of food , why not spare pain and abort ?
He has been published . Not on the Big Bang -that is not going to happen in America .You are either getting your information from propogandist or making it up yourself . he was a fellow at Los Alamos and Oakridge for more than a decade . Only an XXXXX would consider him a crackpot he is a brilliant scientist . He is presently involved in a lawsuit for being excluded form a scientific forum for posting his objections to the Big Bang . To you everyone who is not an atheist is a crackpot . According to you 96 % of Americans are crackpots . Your comparing Gentry to fireworks man shows your bias , your inability to think for yourself or your total lack of integrity .
So Galileo . I shared your post and link with the Author of gunlaws.com / Bloomfield Press Alan Korwin , and he said I could share this , and any reply he gets with you guys . To Jon S. Vernick ; Lisa M. Hepburn A friend sent me a link to your paper on gun-law counts . http : //www.brookings.edu/es/urban/pu ... s/gunbook4.pdf Your finding of approximately 300 major state gun laws appears to be incorrect . California alone has 541 numbered statutes of gun law , twice what the federal government has passed . We publish the gun laws for several states , and distribute books on the subject for 24 states . Our definition for a gun law , while slightly different than yours , is close enough and guides our selection -- with a need to include no extraneous material that would increase the girth and cost of our books . If it affects private ownership , possession or use of firearms , it is included . A huge list of laws that are not included , which would raise the counts dramatically , is printed in the front of each of our books ( e.g. , regs for police , criminals , military , Native Americans , federal officials , etc . ; 55 numbered federal statutes deal solely with armed federal agents ) . Gun-law counts are somewhat preposterous though because , for example , a single law can regulate numerous disparate subjects . The Brady law , for example , with its 3,000 words , controls airline baggage , point-of-sale purchases , development and maintenance of an FBI computer gun-tracking system and much more . Counting it as `` one law '' would be hopelessly misleading if the goal is to determine how much gun law exists . For specifics , I can tell you affirmatively that at last count there were 271 numbered federal gun-controlling statutes ; Texas had 226 ; Arizona 183 ; Florida 229 ; and Virginia , in out just released 7th edition , has 193 . Your overall count of 300 would therefore seem to come up somewhat short , would n't you agree ? You 'll find background and and extended discussion of true counts here : gunlaws.com - FAQ The real question though is this : Is there any criminal gun-related activity that is not already banned ? The answer to that is no , and usually there are multiple bans for any nefarious activity you can imagine . New proposals invariable seek to criminalize possession by the public , possession which is perfectly lawful and harms no one , creating victimless crimes , and malum prohibitum laws that reduce freedom . That 's why new bills typically meet such stiff resistance . Is there a mechanism for you to amend your paper for Brookings ? It 's certainly in your best interests to have accurate information in the public domain with your names attached .

Just curious , is it beyond you to make a post that includes common sense and logic ? I 'm thinking it is since all of you posts seem to be based on rhetoric and emotion . Three paragraphs and all of them contain a falsehood/ lie , congrats your batting 1.000 .
Today I was driving my son and two of his team-mates to basketball practice . One of the kids used the word gay in a derogatory manner . I asked him not to . My son said `` ya , my dad is gay . '' No teasing , no name calling , a few curious a questions and back to basketball . My son has also been thrown to floor of the bus and force fed garbage for asking a kid to not use the word `` gay '' in a derogatory manner . Do you really think the solution is to prevent gay people from forming families so mean kids can have free reign to be little asses ? Or maybe the fact that a kid has gay parents is n't the real issue . I would also like to point out that your argument fails to address the thousands of gay parents who have BIOLOGICAL children .
But Mexicans and Native Americans are the same species , so it 's not just like that . This butterfly is a species different than either parent . One reason that that particular creationist objection has no merit is because the butterflies are significantly biologically different ( i.e . different species ) . The fact that we call each species a type of butterfly has only to do with our taxonomic system . If we were to somehow have fossils representing the complete record of the water-to-land transition , one would be forced to pick a point at which a fish became a land animal . Just because one finds this a difficult task to accomplish does n't mean that there was no transition . Likewise , this applies to any line of ancestry . As an example , look at creationists ' response to Archaeopteryx . Many insisted that it is a bird . Others insisted that it is a reptile . A few have originally called it a bird , then decided that it must be a reptile . The fact that people have trouble fitting an organism into our previously-learned concepts of classifications is a sign that species have changed significantly .
All of the points above should be considered if you want to produce a solid argument that a series of events actually occured in the past . If you wish others to take this seriously please produce some relevant evidence from a source that held to a higher level of credibility . By your standards I should make a thread based on the National Enquirer or Star about Kerry 's life as a male gigolo or golddigger .
But what would he have learned from it ? If you 're going to use that analogy , then lets say the last thing he remembers is walking to the bar . What would he learn or have experienced ?
You do realize that the rules are supposed to be absurd , to point up the absurdity of a recent court ruling , right ?

Their `` ultimate reality '' is that some higher authority may exist . It 's still an `` ultimate reality '' to them . Definitely a religion .
Actually , we did n't . The first record of a melanic form was in 1848 . Presumably other melanic individuals had appeared before this , both in Biston bebularia as well as other moths . We know that a similar mutation occucrred in other moths North America some years after the 1848 record of the B. betualria . There are actually several alleles of the gene responsible for color that form a dominence hierarchy with the fully black morph ( called carbonaria ) as the top dominant and the typical as recessive . The intermediate forms are referred to as insularia . They are uncommon . At any rate , by 1895 , 98 % of observed B. betularia in industrialized areas were carbonaria .
Yes , it does infer that doesnt it , but as I said earlier you have to read it thoroughly in order to see that there is a physical and spiritual make-up to all human beings .
Listen , I have forgotten more than you will ever learn about what is real and true in this world , so either back up your insults with facts or get lost because It is becoming painfully obvious that attempting to reason with you is an exercise in futility . kind of like trying to travel from point A to point B on a merry-go-round .
Writing takes longer than reading .
Actually , you do n't have to have FAITH in science . Good science demands you test it . Repeatedly . That vast majority of religion demands you accept it without question .
How is that a affect of deterrence ? Deterrence works by preventing people through the fear of consequences . A dead man has no fears . Furman Vs. Georgia , where the supreme court specifically noted that there is not a single piece of conclusive evidence that the penalty is a effective deterrent .
If you paid attention the BATFE said so . Yes but some people do n't want to close the borders . They prefer no border controls .

... and I was n't disappointed I do n't know what 'chance as causality ' is supposed to mean , but to speak of evolution being 'based on chance ' is highly misleading . If I have an accident on the way to work tomorrow morning , there will be a definite cause ; a specific series of events leading up to it . We can not guess what they might be . Nevertheless , we can still makes statements about the statistical likelihood of such an accident occurring , yes ? Does that accurate statement of probability mean that my fate on the road is literally determined by a dice roll , that if my number comes up , I crash , with 'chance as causality ' ? Of course not . We are merely describing the likelihood of an event in a system of which we have imperfect knowledge . As our knowledge of the system increases , our assessment of that likelihood changes : if you know my age and gender , my driving habits , my route and how busy or quiet it is - all these things permit a more accurate assessment of the odds . If we had perfect knowledge of a deterministic system , the odds would be 1 or 0 . Similarly , every mutation that has ever occurred has had a definite proximate cause , and if we knew what they all were and what they would all be in the future , evolution would lie mapped out before us in all its detail . Nevertheless , in the absence of perfect knowledge of these individual causes we can still describe the occurrence of such events statistically , saying how long we might have to wait , or how many trials we might conduct in order to expect a given outcome . So to say that the evolution of the nylon bug , for instance , was based on chance is misleading : the evolution of the nylon bug was based on whatever proximate cause shuffled its DNA . Correctly viewed , evolution is not a series of unlikely events , but a series of highly likely ones . It is highly likely , for instance , that some bacteria in a large colony would experience a mutation enabling the digestion of nylon . Sure - breaking that event down on a per-bacterium basis yields tiny probabilities , but why stop there ? Why not break it down on a per-bacterium , per-microsecond basis ? The chances just got even smaller ! See ? It 's a silly way to think about it , because in the end it 's the chance of the event occurring that matters , not some arbitrary deadline by which it must occur or cell to which it must occur .
And right at the top of the list , at a whopping 31.2 per 100,000 , is Washington DC , even though they had a complete and total gun ban in place . How the hell do you explain that ? Nobody could own handguns , nobody could ever carry a gun , nobody could have a gun outside of their home , nobody could even load their private guns , so how do they get to be at the top of the list or death rates ?
Do you have a quote ? a link ? anything to make us think that you 're not spinning this like you tend to spin everything else ? Here 's something you did n't think through : you say that `` inherent '' human dignity is a derivative of the image-of-God claim . First , that makes it most certainly not inherent but derived . Second , you insult the entire human race when you claim that human dignity is dependent upon anything else . I 'm sorry that you think so little of humans .
Just this morning there was an article in the paper about a woman in the Extreme Southern part of Texas in Brownsville being shot `` with a stray bullet from Mexican soldiers '' on our side of the river . Over 80 % of the crimes are committed by Mexican gang members , many of which are ex-soldiers and drug enforcement for the mafias . Nope , not safe at all when foreign invaders attack Texans on our side of the river and do pseudo cop break and enters of homes or robbery of businesses . That is a good example of the importance of being armed . One county sheriff along the river encouraged citizens to get armed just for that purpose , freely admitting that his officers will not be there when they are needed the most . We Texans have kidnapping and ransome too but reserve our right to protect ourselves unlike EuroAsia who has copitulated entirely . You were saying ?
No ! At conception we are a person and human . All living things belong to a species and the foetus is a living thing , for that reason a foetus must belong to a species , and that species is human . A fingernail is dead so can not be considered a living human , nor will it develop into a human . The sperm only has half the chromosomes so is not human . The unique human is the key element here , if you cut your nail , the DNA from the nail can be replicated by the living persons nail , a foetus when destroyed can not have itself replicated , the unique DNA that is destroyed will never be see on earth again , that individual has gone forever , howver , the man with the nail clipped is still alive .
I think perhaps you 're confused . 1 . I know of no meaningful definion of the term `` god ' as it pertains to reality . 2 . When you mention science and history , that implies you are interested in reality . 3 . There is no evidence to support mythological deities , god or God or Odin or the easter bunny . * So , yes THERE IS NO EVIDENCE of the existence of any mytholgoical gods . ** Yes , there is no evidence that the universe was created , or if that statement even has meaning if the universe always was , and always will be . p.s . There is easter bunny . -Mach
Do you have Kenneth Miller 's book ?
So you 've gone from evolution and ID to cosmology . You have a real problem with maintaining established realms . ID addresses evolutionary theory , not abiogenesis , and not cosmology .
Actually the idea ( intelligent modification of a developing organism by that organism during its development ) is as INCOHERENT with or without the introduction of GOD . Its an immaterialist concept invoking elan vital or its equiavlent which these days is sometimes designated as `` intelligence '' so as to put the old and spoiled wine of vitalism into new bottles with the hopes that the new label will allow the proponents to sell it to the public .
And it is much easier to have an abortion than to be a mother .
Not really . World forests are at risk for farm land and non-paper logging , not for paper which is being replaced by post consumer waste at increasing rates . Most paper people use today contains at least some recycled paper .

Ok . So Lott is flakey . Then Bellesiles is OK ? Riiiiight . I though a person 's reputation stood on thier own behavior and achivements , not based on someone else . Besides the debate weather Lott is dishonest or not is debatable and still going on . The debate weather Bellesiles is dishonest is over , he is most definately a liar , and this was decided by his boss and the Banqcroft prize commitee .
And how would Bush look if his own people hated him so much that they revolted ? That would be very bad publicity , and quite an embarrassment that I would n't want as a country leader .

So the fact that there are fewer crimes in britain is evidence , but the fact that there is a great deal more crime in S Africa , despite having some of the strictest gun control laws in the world , is not ? In new york , the reduction in crime was the result of an overhaul of police and the criminal justice system . Couple pages on that : http : //www.city-journal.org/html/15_1_ny_crime.html http : //www.ny.gov/governor/patrecord/crime.html New York started instituting prohibitive firearms laws in the 60s . Most of the firearms laws they `` enjoy '' now were put in place in the 70s ( except for a brief round of idiocy in the 90 's having to do with semi-auto rifles ... . '' assault weapons '' , which they banned despite the fact that the police commissioner of NY City testified that they had no record of one ever being used in a crime ) . So , they had prohibitive gun control for 30+ years , and then when they spent billions on theri criminal justice system and police , none of which had anything to do with gun control , their crime rate started to fall , and somehow you want us to believe that this was due to the gun control ? Nobody here is that gullible .
But , now simone is in a pickle . Is there an explanation as to why police officers carry these things ? ( OH ! Now we switch to the purpose of the USER ! How convenient ! I wish I could determine that an item is bad using one train of logic , and then SWITCH LINES OF LOGIC to suit my argument ! I will bet that simone will choose to COMPLETELY IGNORE MY POST because I am removing all lines of dishonest `` logic switching '' . ( or , at least attempting to ) Rather than admit wrongness , ( very hard to do once a person has so vehemently commited themselves to an agenda ) there is no other choice than to follow the trail of that path to the end . Even if the path leads to a land of complete logical make believe and you are thereby forced to defend your chosen agenda even if it means temporarily making logical `` detours '' . After all , if objects have no inherent evil or goodness , it must be the character of the USER and the chosen purpose of the USER that determines the ethical value of how an item is used . If this is so , you ca n't call guns bad . This determination can not be admitted on the path simone has chosen . Therefore , since simone 's agenda insists on the inherent evilness of an object ( a gun ) there MUST be some logical deviation to explain why these `` evil '' items are not `` evil '' when used by police . If there is no logical deviation on a path that is in error , you will have no choice but to arrive in error 's destination : make believe land ! Where matches burn down houses ! And knives cause slashings ! And candle holders cause bashed in skulls ! ... .AND ... ... AND ... ..GUNS CAUSE SHOOTINGS ! Well , simone . We 're down to brass tacks . Is a gun bad , or is it the determination of the person who uses it ? Because if a gun is bad , then we live in la-la land . And if a gun is an inanimate object who 's user is responsible for how it is used , you have no argument for why law abiding people ca n't posess them and be capable of the determination ( As police do ) for using them in a responsible manner . Just like matches , or cars , or candle holders . So , simone ... ... ... ...
But of course , according to one singularly deranged poster here , it 's the Republicans who are truly pro-gay ( they just ca n't show it , doncha know ) , while the Democrats are just paying phony-baloney lip service to us ...
No . The pot should not have rights . You , however , should stop dropping acid
No , everyone should have those regardless of marriage . You 're the one here who seems to think straight and gay marriage should be a litmus test for those things .
Tell me it ai n't so ! ! ! Unfrickin believable !
Actually , it is n't . It is complex and complicated . It requires diligent study of difficult concepts . But when you grasp the basics , it does become evident . But most creationists are n't willing to put in the effort .
Alarm at routine patrols by armed police - Crime , UK - The Independent
Hi jitobear . I am also pro-choice . This comment jumped out at me , though . Do you think it 's seen as awful do to cultural conditioning ? Could this have it wrong ? There is no scientific basis that it 's a human person , at the stage of development when the vast majority of abortions occur . I worry that by suggesting it 's so negative , it ca n't help but be a stigma on the woman who chooses to abort her pregnancy . No woman should feel the need to apologize in relation to abortion , which is just about control over one 's own body .
And people say I make strawman arguments . Simply put , not enough to justify your `` concerns '' .
The meticulously preserved , unchanging 66 Books of the Bible are n't compelling ?
The enemies of freedom already have . The coined a new word . It is PRE Traumatic Stress Disorder . Meanwhile , 12 times as many children die from Drowning than from accidental gunshot !
and both can and are inported illegaly .
While that definition of sin is true , the Hebrew definition means missing the mark . You could stretch it to mean unfit in English . And you 're technically wrong about the bible . Modernly it is one book , but bible means little books . For a time they were floating around in clusters . So academically they are self contained and unrelated . The apocryphal books are `` secret '' books . Religious scholars eventually decided they were just a bunch of stories , and most never made it in the bible . Look at Song of Solomon it made the cut , and people still have problems with it being put in , yet it conflicts with nothing .
but it is what section 32 of Indiana constitution Section 32 . Arms -- Right to bear . The people shall have a right to bear arms , for the defense of themselves and the State .
Bertvan : I suspect that once those other processes are acknowledged , most people will realize it is unlikely that natural selection ever actually created anything .
I think what Steeeve is noting is that one of the central tenets of Catholicism is ecclesiastical authority . This is n't like disagreeing on the color of the choir robes . If you do n't recognize the authority of the Pope , then basically you are n't really Catholic .
... . i can make up one just as prophetic . `` The sky is black , the shadows powerful , God 's domain judged by the unseen '' Obviously this a prophetic for 26th dimensional superstring theory and how it governors the universe 's physical properties in unforseen ways . Do n't you see it ? It 's quite obvious ! To the RATIONAL world , that is completely absurd , just like your analysis of how the scriptures work in your opninion .
It 's worse than that , Pandion . For example , here 's what I told him over at ARN on the same subject back on April 5th . http : //www.arn.org/ubbthreads/showfl ... e # Post30331420
I would be interested to see where I made such a claim . Prove your assertion .
What 's the main point in this case ?
And once it has begun , which would you rather have ?
Well , I did say I was being nit-picky : all I was objecting to was the way the original wording suggested that the change was occurring in order to avoid competition . Assuming it was due to selection , the competition from the larger birds was the putative agent of that selection . ( Incidentally , I suspect we live on the same side of the Atlantic . )
So will you be comparing gays to child molesters and priests in your same examples ? Or blacks with slinging drugs and hoochie mammas ? Or will you note the eerie similarities betweenn the wording of some of our gun laws to the Nazi gun laws ?
Well , as usual the Creationist is trying to make an arguement against science using their moral viewpoint . Forget about all that pseudo science trying to discredit evolution and geochronology , all it comes down to is this : `` My religion has the exact answers to questions about my origins , I do not like what science has to say on this subject '' . Its so much more succinct that way , I just wish they could be up front about it .
And you say I 'm crazy ? ! This guy interrogates rocks !
Thanks : your contributions to this thread throw more light on the subject than anybody else 's . However , not sure that believers in any religion in which supernatural agencies are worshipped would be happy with the inclusion of `` God '' among the set of human beings - unless Jesus Christ was both a man and God which I think is a Christian doctrine . I suppose I started out reading this particular thread expecting to discover a non-circular logical argument that would `` prove '' the existence of a God - and found nothing of the kind . I now think my questions on the matter have been rather stupid and naive .
First of all , when gun owners say ban guns , it means , if you want to ban ANY Gun , you are a gun banner ! You guys want to muck up the argument with we do n't want to ban all guns , just some guns ! However , that statement is just for now ! If you get the ban more will be following ! Nelson T. 'Pete ' Shields -- Founder of Handgun Control , Inc .
Well your right , Waxy There is no real `` logic '' to my post , because if one thinks about the art of debating religion , the concept of logic goes out the window . A true believer has only the bible to support their beliefs , they can not go to a lab or science room and prove their beliefs on a table , or use cobalt to date religous belief , so their belief is all based on unseen faith . I have only a high school education , therefore I do not have the vocabulary the master debators use on here , nor the artistic way of putting together sentences . So bear with me please , while I try to explain my post a little better ... . Since you put me in the spotlight here , I will use you , with great respect to you of course , as my point of debate . You have went on record here stating many times , that you do not believe in a `` god '' the way we believers do . Now with that notion in mind , why do you and others hang out debating on a religous forum ? ? In case you havent noticed , the posts against the notion of God and Christianity , greatly outnumber the posts of the believers . Is that not a interesting fact when you think about it ? I dont believe in a lot of things that I am exposed to in my walk though life here on earth , so I have NO interest in trying to prove those things wrong , THAT I feel have no validity . Clear as mud now , ? ?
This is not a case of disagreement on the interpretation of evidence , it is science versus science fiction . It is a direct accusation by the CURATOR OF BIRDS for the SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION against all the proponents of the dino bird story . Not some as you say `` crackpot '' Creationist . These are only two of the many scientist that are embarrassed by the outrageous dishonesty of their contemporaries . .
( I 'm just curious what you mean by you 'will not put up with [ it ] ' ? You may have to put up with it , as there may be some people who choose to do that , and you have no control to stop them . Just as a suggestion , you may get further by asking respectfully that people not comment unless they have read the entire article . My two cents . ) In this particular article , Mr. Alcorn does not back up any of his assertions with evidence . Some of what he states in this article is common knowledge that needs no documentation ( i.e . a human fetus is human and it is alive ) . But in this article , he states many generalities , he states many opinions ( to which there are alternate views ) , and he backs nothing up . I 'm not saying that the facts he presents can not be backed up , but until they are backed up with solid documentation , there are a lot of holes in what he is saying . For example : `` 2f . There is substantial scientific reason to believe frozen embryos are persons , and should be granted the same rights as older , larger and less vulnerable persons . '' Substantial scientific reason ? ? ? Like what ? A 'person ' is not a scientific concept . Science does not identify the definitions of what can or can not be labeled a 'person . ' That is a legal and/or philisophical topic . `` 3g . Even before the unborn is obviously human in appearance , she is what she is-a human being . '' Here again , a human being is not a scientific term . `` 3e . Every abortion stops a beating heart and terminates measurable brain waves . '' This is not necessarily true . Mr. Alcorn also asserts that the birth control pill causes abortions prior to implantation of the blastocyst in the uterine lining . There is no beating heart or measurable brain activity at this stage of biological development . Both of his assertions , as stated , can not be correct . If one statement is true , then the other must logically be false . `` 5d . It is a scientific fact that there are thought processes at work in unborn babies. `` Where 's the evidence ? Define 'thought processes . ' It may be a fact ... that leaves open the possibility that it may not be true . `` 5h . Arguments against the personhood of the unborn are shrouded in rationalization and denial. `` This is his opinion ... to which he is entitled . `` 9a . Once we grant that the unborn are human beings , it should settle the question of their right to live. `` True . But we have not yet granted that unborn are 'human beings . ' `` 13b . The poor choice of premarital sex is never compensated for by the far worse choice of killing an innocent human being . '' Again . This is merely Mr. Alcorn 's opinion -- both that premarital sex is a 'poor choice ' and the remainder of the statement . `` 14a . Early feminists were prolife , not prochoice. `` Define 'early . ' Are we talking back to the days of Eve ? I do n't believe Margaret Sanger was prolife . `` 14d . The basic premises of the abortion-rights movement are demeaning to women. `` Unsupported opinion . `` 17a . Every child is wanted by someone-there is no such thing as an unwanted child. `` How many children are on the street in this great country ? How many children are waiting to be adopted ? It may be true that all children are wanted by someone , but it is also true that there are many , many children without a home and without a family ... who are being bounced around from foster home to foster home , not finding anyone who 'wants ' them . This is fact . A dear friend of mine is a child protection social worker in a metropolitan area . She deals with this every day . `` 18c . If children are viewed as expendable before birth , they will be viewed as expendable after birth. `` Not sure if I follow this one ... if someone wants a child in the womb , they are not viewed as expendable before birth ... if someone does n't want a child in the womb and it is aborted , there wo n't be anything to be expendable after birth . `` 20b . The dramatic decline in our birth rate will have a disturbing economic effect on America. `` Ummm ... this may be true . It may not be true . Fact is ... we do n't know . We can only make educated guesses . I could go on ... but I think my point has been made . One final one , though ... I had to giggle when I read this one : `` Abortion has made us a nation of schizophrenics about our children . '' It seems that you are fervent in your beliefs that abortion is 'wrong . ' I respect you for knowing what you believe and for standing up for it . Understand , though , that there are individuals who may disagree with you . To imply that they are 'wrong ' and you are 'right ' or they are ignorant or stupid or anything of the sort is a rather self-centered view of the world . In this mindset , it is possible that you are looking at everything from the 'wrong ' perspective . Maybe the other person is actually 'right ' and you are the ignorant one . ( Note : I 'm not suggesting that you are calling anyone stupid or ignorant ... nor am I suggesting you are stupid or ignorant . I 'm just making a point . ) I challenge you to develop a logical argument -- based on facts with supporting evidence , and not based on opinions or 'moral ideals ' -- that is so convincing that even the most 'pro-choice ' person in the world could see ( if they are being honest with themselves and the world ) that abortion is 'wrong . '

How elegant . Yes science is the way to understanding the physical world , and faith is the manifestation of our spiritual selves . But when you say this among sci-only people , it is immediately misconstrued . Most sci people wo n't even read that sentence objectively . Say the word `` spirit '' and suddenly you are changed into a fundamentalist , inbred , uneducated , dimwit who would n't know Planck 's constant if it hit you in the head . Life is much more than a series of reactions . It is cool that we are able to reduce it down so much . The benefits of science are vast . But there just seems that there is more than meets the eye . I 'm curious .
What we have here is simply a perspective problem , which is the problem with most debates . I see the Bible as sound , and every `` error '' in the Bible I have researched ( I have admittedly not researched them all ) have been refuted .
What about this hypothetical rock ? Can it exist ? Or , does this mean that God himself requires God 's Will to exist ? Cyclical !
Almost ? Usually , that is true , and it involves selection between populations . However , there are often times when some of a population is better able to survive . Those times , selection occurs within a population .
Then you do n't actually have a definition of information that is meaningful . I did n't think you did . By the way , increase in the amount ( i.e. , more letters ) of DNA has often been observed . The mechanisms of evolution account for it quite nicely . Now please try again an define information in a way that is meaningful to DNA .

Well then this does n't answer my question . If you have 10 doctors for 100 people ( this is just an example ) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $ 100 a year then your health care per capita is $ 10 ( [ 10doctors x $ 100 ] /100 people ) . If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $ 10 per capita as well because you population did not change . Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured : Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country , 2007 & amp ; mdash ; Infoplease.com So again , if you go from $ 6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $ 4,100 per capita then where did that money come from ?
I got ta admit , I got a real chuckle out of this one . Waxy
You mean like music ?
And how exactly do you propose this suggestion actually be enforced ? Have you got it all thought out and prepared to defend in a debate , or are you just throwing out what the liberal loonies tell you is a good idea ?
Actually , you are living off my organs and life processes . If my heart stopped beating , would you get fed ? No . If my brain stopped ? No . If I suffered a stroke ? No . Two , the kidnapping is very synonymous : you were put in a life-threatening situation without consent , just as a fetus , doomed to be aborted , is put in one without consent . Three , these are arbitrary requisites and you have not proven to me why they are necessary to afford protections to the `` entity . '' A man just knocked out in a boxing match shares many similar qualities as a fetus . Should we kill him ? Four is nullified by two .
This depends on the form of abortion : some involve stopping the womb being a suitable enviroment for the babies survival rather than killing it directly . However , of all the arguments it is possibly the most human rights based .
This is true from the atheistic and secular humanist perspective since they will grasp at any natural explanation , no matter how flimsy and shallow rather than the spiritual explanation . But it does n't answer the specific question I asked at all .
You are making up your own strawman arguments as you go along . Asking `` what they would need '' is a poor mask to avoid the fact that YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE in the first place . A lot of `` does n't this look like ... '' , but that 's akin to interpreting Rorschach tests . You see what you want to .
Anyway Duo_Maxwell this is n't only creationist debaters , there are many more who do the same thing with different debates . you also forgot 7 . Make random accusations of logical fallacies when they have no idea what they even mean . Example : You said that my spelling is wrong , that 's the biggest strawman I 've ever heard 8 . Correct spelling mistakes and convienantly not answer the question . Example : `` What do you thinkk of carbon dating ? '' `` you spelled think wrong '' . If you want to correct spelling , fine but answer the question as well .
Yes , it is , and I 'll gladly excuse his grammar compared to my zero ability in Hungarian .
What 's great is that somebody had to have been on the lookout for PZ out of fear of his getting in . What 's greater is that they opened themselves to ridicule : he 's a good source when his statements can be edited and removed from context , but FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO N'T LET HIM SEE THE MOVIE !
So much for your cover . Its blown . You just made another gaps argument making the assumption that if theory X does not explain observation Y that a theory which is untested and untestable MUST be the only alternative explanation . Balderdash and shame on you . The alternative theories would likely be numerous and the ONLY one is not something untested and untestable . But I forgive you GOD probably made you make the error for his own mysterious reasons . Or else your statement is evil and was forced upon you by the devil . Maybe you will never know - in this life at least
So what are some examples of restrictive gun laws in South Africa ? The people in South Africa think their gun laws are not strict enough . In one of your previous posts you seem determined to use South Africa as evidence that outlawing guns does n't work . But gun ownership is still legal there .

You know what the funny thing is about all of the `` links '' that they have found between ape and man ? I could easily find people today that look exactly like the `` links '' that scientists have found . Maybe you should try picking one `` link '' from the site that you gave me . I could give you creationist sites , but that would n't prove anything more than your site proved . Here 's an alternative theory : creation by God .
No baby is more precious than another as far as my personal beliefs go it is no more alright to terminate a baby concieved through rape/incest than it is to terminate a baby classed as a mistake/inconvenience .
You 've asked a good question cash , the way you know that is by all of the excuses you 're getting rather than any attempts to actually answer you directly with solid evidence . Of course we know that evidence does n't exist , but they 'll never admit that either .
Oh , we could let them in I guess . How much room would it take up in a textbook , two pages maybe ?
And what evidence do you have , aside from a set of books written between 1900 and 2800 years ago that there is even a 'God ' to box with . OH.. and the ectasy drivien delusional state of mind you get in when you worship . As for the answer to the origins of life , how would you know ? Do you know what the current state of affairs about the knowledge of abiogenesis is ? Can you point to articles about it , showing it ca n't happen ? ? From peer reviewed journals of course . NO , you ca n't . I can show a lot of articles about abiogenesis , but that would be worthless for you . You would be unwilling to look at it . I could show you articles about on the development of gender , and of how sexual reproduction became to be formed , but you would n't look at it .
Actually , the Mormon seminaries are n't `` on the grounds , '' although they may be on an adjacent , privately owned piece of property . It would be unconstitutional for the seminaries to be on property owned by the school district . The children go to the seminary on released-time , which has been found to be constitutional ( although I do n't see how ) . Pertinent decisions about religious instruction and schools are : McCollum v. Board of Education ( 333 U.S. 203 ) Zorach v. Clauson ( 343 U.S. 306 ) McCollum found that religious instruction on school property is unconstitutional , while Zorach found that `` accommodating '' religious instruction by releasing students from school for that purpose was not .
No it does n't . That 's why Darwin objected to the use of that phrase in reference to his theory . Those who do n't bother to learn the theory tend to misunderstand . Fittness is not a reference to big and strong . It makes it too easy to misrepresent evolutionary theory . I 'll state it again since you seem to have missed or ignored it the first time . Natural selection is differential reproductive success . Those organisms that are well adapted to their environment tend to survive to reproduce in greater numbers , and therefore they tend to leave more offspring , than those organisms that are less well adapted . You 've got to be a pretty shallow thinker to equate an environmental advantage with big and strong .
Said like a cruel evil person who has no concern for his fellow man .
Fruit is a name we give to identify a physical object ; the laws of logic are not physical . When you say fruit exists you can show its existence in the physical world . If the laws of logic exist , then show me . For one thing , atheism can not account for a universal concept that is not material , and does not depend on our thinking . In addition to that , I am using the same argument atheists use against the existence of God to get the atheist to show me the existence of the laws of logic . Atheists say , Show me God I can not see him . Theist describe that the universe can not exist without God by showing the affects of God in the material universal ( design ) Show me the laws of logic , where is it ? I can not see it . Using apples is describing it is not the law itself . Just like I describe the evidence of Gods existence . The laws or logic are not universal ? Again , you are using matter to show something that is non-material , I can look at fruit until I am blue in the face but that only describes concepts , it is not the laws of logic itself .
So you are saying that genesis is a scientific fact . Ok , so how did all the millions of species of life fit on a 450 ft wooden ship ?
You know , this little phrase , `` minutes before birth , '' keeps popping up in reference to abortion . Could someone please explain to me the point of having an abortion `` minutes before birth '' ? What is the point ? How many , if any , of this sort of abortion is performed ? Could I get a really honest answer to that ? Please , no lies . How many ? Can anyone tell me ?
The same ones you 've been told about , what , a few dozen times now ? A small exerpt :
Oh , there 's no hypocrisy involved , just you being your usual self and not even looking at the actual information ( or , more likely , looking at the information and then deliberately playing dumb ) .
If you think that it 's OK when the Mother 's life is in danger . Why would n't it be OK when her life is n't in danger ?
Oh they are ? Thats strange ... I could not find where exactly they stand on any of thier numerous websites , just more restrictions ... And the old HCI was not `` moderate ''
A Jungian might suggest such a stance . In other words , one ( good ) can not exist without the other ( evil ) . I wonder what some of our more interesting christian friends ( AA , GC ) might have to say about such ?
I personally opted for abortion over adoption for two main reasons . 1 . I had no intention to get pregnant . I faithfully took the pill , and by fiance always used a condom . Despite these precautions , we experienced that `` percentage failure '' of contraception . I found out I was pregnant several weeks in , and my fiance and I made our decision together . 2 . We had no money . We are both in college ( finishing up our Masters degrees in a few weeks now ) , and have enormous student loan fees as well as numerous other monetary problems . Right now the most we can do is finish up school and pay to keep our apartment . Pregnancy is a very expensive thing ( which is why I find it ridiculous that pro-lifers offer adoption as if it was such a great option , because adoption itself can be free , but they do n't take into consideration everything before adoption ) , and we could n't afford to have a child to give up for adoption let alone actually raise one . To add to the obvious costs of pregnancy , there is also the loss of pay as I would not be able to work ( I 'm a geologist - this involves quite a bit of strenuous outdoors work ) , which would even further affect us . Hope everything was clear to you , if you have any questions , just ask . Those were my reasons , and there are many many more that apply to different women in different ways .
Little boy , you need to do a little study on Nazis . They specialized in death . Unlike pro-life people .
But I 'll bet that you do n't know what any of them are .

And there are plenty of cases where criminals are scared off by much less than a gun .
Well , I do n't work with any `` reefer heads '' or pot smokers now ... this was awhile back .
So , this statement is from a 'law center ' that is dedicated to defend the religious freedom for CHristians . Yet , this is n't about 'religion ' . Why do I find that hypocritical .
I 'll have you know that the abortion went without a hitch , and my uterus is perfectly healthy , thankyouverymuch ( not that it is any of your business ) , and yes , I do plan to have a child in the future , and do n't really care what you think about it .
This is simply false . Rock can be folded under pressure . This has been proven by lab experiment . However there are many features in sedimentary rocks that can not be formed quickly , for example , fossil trackways .
Is there evidence for this change in atmospheric compostion ?
And there you go totally misunderstanding evolution . The mechaism is NOT luck . It is natural selection . You claim you do n't like rhetoric , but you just put a nice piece of rhetoric above . Here is a response to the bacteria flagellum arguement . http : //www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB200_1.html
Hmm , when you say `` numberless '' do you mean something other than the standard definition of infinite ? If not , please explain how an infinite number of organisms could be created in a finite time with finite space and resources . Thank you .
And Stephen Hawking , the only thing he has said was `` I do not believe in a personal god '' , which would make him a pantheist or deist at best .

The desperate flailings of a city with absolutely no common sense . They 're so impotent in their abilities to get tough on criminals , they feel it necessary to go after the most unrelated sources to try and make themselves look big and busy . Why not just build a big wall to cut itself off from the rest of the world , and set up high security check points so cars coming and going can be checked to ensure no contraband is being smuggled in .
Roeder was n't a terrorist .
Exactly and if you accept that animals have been on the Earth for millions of years then why ca n't evolution be a process that God created and controls ?
What the father wants is ultimately irrelevent . It 's the woman 's body that carries the fetus . It ultimately the woman 's decision . As wrong as that may seem to you , it is the reality . If we , as a society , would just address the issue of unwanted pregnancies , then we , as a society , will resolve the isse of abortion .
Well , I was kind of hoping that my questioning would encourage you to provide a quote to show us exactly what Dembski himself said , but I guess I wasnt blunt enough . Youve now made it clear that your claim  which is still unsupported  is that Dembski says a fourth law of thermodynamics , and not the fourth law of thermodynamics . But that still would not necessarily make Dembski wrong . Does Dembkis wording show he means a fourth law-of-thermodynamics , or a fourth-law-of-thermodynamics ? The first would be wrong but the second would be right . To try to make this clearer : ... .. We have a zeroth law of thermodynamics . ... .. We have a first law of thermodynamics . ... .. We have a second law of thermodynamics . ... .. We have a third law of thermodynamics . ... .. Dembski claims to have uncovered a fourth law of the thermodynamics . If his actual statements can be read in that sense , then his claiming to have come up with a fourth law of thermodynamics does not show ignorance , on his part , of their already being 4 laws of thermodynamics . And as I suggested in my post , here is Stuart Kauffman , who is clearly neither a Creationist nor an ID Creationist , speaking of his attempts to uncover a fourth law of thermodynamics ...
It also allows SCOTUS to strike down State laws that violate constitutional rights
Nonsense . The most widely accepted idea is that these epics were oral traditions that were finally recorded in writing , possibly by a guy named Homer . Read and read .
And if God was so against killing the unborn , why did he fail to make an exception for the pregnant women ? If you alleged that the Biblical God is totally against killing the unborn , why did he tell him to kill all of the non-virgin women ? I bet you wo n't answer the question and just rely on insults as an attempt to cover up your argumentative failures as you always do . See my signature for examples .
A-MEN brother ...
Horrible conclusion , drawn from premises known to be false .
Like blacks once were ? Was n't that the main thrust of the 14th amendment and incorporation ? Given incorporation , imagine the suits those acts of discrimination would bring
No it means that the genome operates in a more complex way than was previously believed . It does not mean that `` life is irreducibly complex '' since that term is not even sufficiently well defined to test the assertion . And given the scattering of information into many pieces I would say that more and more it looks like `` pieces that happen to be fitted together '' . More and more like a complex kludge . Exactly what one might expect to find in an evolved system rather than a designed or deliberate or intentional one !
Actually , 2 viruses and a bacteria have been constructed by building the genome from nucleic acids .
Are they planning fun fair rides and people dressed as Mickey Mouse at this place ? There could even have a `` feed the T Rex '' event where people get to throw lettuce sandwiches into the `` dino pit '' That gives me an idea . Why do n't we have a competition to come up with the best suggestion for a display or show at this theme park ? The winner gets to feel smug for being so clever
Because you seem to lose sight of that with your whackjob ideas . Case in point `` The manufacturer would have to know where to point LE '' now you have the manufacturer involved in law enforcement . Would you have the big 3 involved in pointing out to LE who last bought their products involving drive bys and vehicular homicide ? You have no clue as to how the whole process works yet you are going to put your oar in and muddy the process . Here 's a small lesson for you . The manufacturers of firearms do n't sell to dealers . They sell to distributors who in turn sell to dealers . You are still lacking any valid proof that the law abiding are the problem .
How do you know carbon dating is so accurate ? Would you bet your life on it ?
Um . Have you read Leveticus ? And I mean , read it . Not skimmed it . Because , God loves everybody . Are you reaching ? And what does fast and loose mean ? I 'm confused . I think you are trying to label me.. but I 'm not quite sure what I 'm being labled as .
Then why are n't doctors who advise rest and plenty of fluids for a cold in jail ? Oh right , because you 're lying , as usual .
so since most abortions were n't rape , do you still support abortions for people who are raped ? Just wondering .
Because the judges President Bush nominates are strict constructionist.They interpret the law not make it ... ... ... ..That is the worse nightmare for a liberal or a gay who depend on judges to over rule the vote of the people ... ... ... ...

And what exactly am i granting to the suit-wearing politicians in washington by giving them the right to revoke her ability to make these decisions for herself ? I do n't think dictatorship is the right word , since she is not asking for the power over anyone but herself , and her child . Would you call a man dying of inoperable cancer who decides to end his chemotherapy a dictator ? Or a parent who decides to remove their child from life-support ? Would you rather it be a democracy ? That everytime a woman is faed with this predicament , we put it to a vote ? How about an oligarchy- where her situation is put in front of some committee who decides her fate ?
The number of deaths wouldn´t be lower in any way . After all , countries like Rwanda and Sierra Leone don´t have a working governmental strucure so couldn´t enforce such a ban .
I 'm afraid it is you who is wrong . I created you so that you would think you created me to think I created everything , even though I did . It 's more of a challenge that way to try to convert people to the one true religion . Since you can see that I wo n't be able to convert the world ( it 's due in a week ) , you can pay $ 100 dollars to me so I will take you with me to the upper world .
When you have no constructive comment just attacks the messenger with your insultsand name calling ... ..typical ... ... ... ... ... so very sad ... ... ... .Its radicals like you that hurt the cause of gay rights ... ... ...
They would not have to be spontaneous or simultaneous but they would have to exactly copy many structures of each other , highly unlikely .
Yes . The assumption happens to be that maybe the bible is n't literal . `` Lets look into ourselves , shall we ? '' Behold we did , and Lo ! The Earth is old !
addition works in the intangible as well . 1 minute + 1 minute = 2 minutes . 1 idea + 1 idea = 2 ideas . the concept of quantity is not limited to matter . if there was just a vaccous void were absolutely nothing was happening , then there would be no application of logic . but even that in itself would be logical . nothing + nothing = nothing is logical . it would actually be logical if a void with nothing added to it result in something . so even in a void , logic still prevails
I see no mention below of any judges in Mass .

Still clueless and still presenting a barrel of laffs I see . Have someone that can read and comprehend spell it out for you . I bet yer mun is considering that to get you out of the basement . How 's the weight loss coming by the way ?
Yes , I 'm always a step behind the word definition switcharoos . I have been told many times on 4forums that abiogenesis is not science .
Well , I do understand that you call it a benefit for compliance , but my argument was that a benefit for compliance is the same thing as a fine for non-compliance and that in reality , the government is simply promoting one lifestyle over another . That is equivalent to destroying freedom . I do understand that the government rewards people for taking certain actions . IRA 's are an example , yes , promoting investment in an IRA does destroy freedom in a sense . But there is at least a debatable reason behind the government using taxpayer money to reward IRA investers . The government wants people to have money in their old age so that they will be happier in the long run . But when the government is promoting heterosexual marriage , it is n't because promoting heterosexual marriage over homosexual marriage is a good thing , and it is n't because heterosexual couples deserve more money or more benefits than same-sex couples . It is because the majority is willing to use religious beliefs as a reason to give themselves more benefits under the law , as a reason to hurt others while benefiting themselves , as a reason to promote their own religoius beliefs over someone else 's .
Actually I did n't even read it ( and doubt I ever will ) . Do n't get all worked up over it .
This is why arguments like `` well , our population is out of control '' never convince ANY Pro-Life advocate that abortion is okay . I think it is amusing when pro-choice people use such arguments ... Pro-Lifers have a priority list , and Life makes it to the top . For Pro-Lifers , it 's a little like saying `` Well , Big Macs taste good , so you should never , ever eat filet mignon since burgers taste good ! '' I mean , sure , burgers taste good , but filet mignon is so much better .
This is an interesting area which has fascinated me for some time . It seems it would be quite a challenge to establish the direct lineage between the Tyrannosaurs and their coeluosaur ancestors given the limited numbers of fossils and the huge separation in time bwtween the animals . I suppose one important point is whether feathers were a characteristic feature of all Coelurosauria at the time when the chinese specimens date from or if they were limited to those group that were directly ancestral to the birds . If they were a diverse trait , then its more likely that feathers featured in T. Rex 's ancestry . However , even if this were the case it would instantly mean that T. Rex was feathered itself- there is a great period of time over which such a trait could have been modified or lost entirely . Maybe T-Rex could have been like modern large mammals that do not have insulating hair- it might have retained a few specialised feathers for other specific purposes . P.S . Hope you have a speedy recovery pandion

Well if they 're automatic weapons then they 're obviously importing them illegally from outside the country and violating federal regulations . You 've got even bigger problems than you think .
Should it be legalized ? Only if every other country did it Is it harmful ? Yes more so then moderate alcohol use and worse then smoking Should it be taxed once legalized ? Yes . Should laws still apply to it , such as DUIs and the like ? Yes .
You know you are full of it when you claim they ca n't just walk into a gun show . Strange that can can do just that at a licensed dealers . What would be so very different than checking licensed dealers at a gun shop and investigating the same at a show ? Go back to the Brady bunch and see if they have any facts that prevent the BATF from doing any thing . Try again Brady as your logic and facts just do n't hold up . edit : The BATFE checks paperwork as part of their investigations . Federal laws are not suspended at gun shows as you would have the uneducated and ill informed believe .
You accuse others of making an assumption to the answer . But then you admit that YOU think the answer should have been assumed . Do you see a problem here ?
DC has a law that human and civil rights can not be put up for a vote , this is the way it should be in the rest of the country . Why do you want to be able to vote on other peoples lives ? Why is it that you are so cruel ?
And for the record , i think anyone that tries to take away a women 's right to her own body is a sexist and has no respect for human life , or has any concious about the woman at stake here . You care merely about a couple of cells and not about the real humans , nor do you care about society . It seems to me you are only trying to earn yourself brownie points in heavan . I am not influenced by that , im going to have my own opinions , and speak about what i feel is right instead of some christian god telling me what to do .
Sigh ... for the ill informed who understand nothing about their religion . http : //www.religioustolerance.org/abo_hist.htm
How ? What exactly did they say , that God did n't invent every living thing individually ? I 'm interested to learn what information you specifically feel was a fabrication .
Both are ok by me : P
This argument is not valid , although it is widely used , and even believed as valid by some that use it . I will use one example of why this is a fallacious argument , in my opinion . To say that an all knowing and loving God would prevent any suffering among the innocent is assuming that a lack of suffering is the best situation for us in God 's view . Perhaps it is not . Think of a muscle analogy , in order to grow it must be stressed . So too we may need trials and difficulty to grow and develop as an all powerful and loving God would desire . Furthermore the argument can be made that God allows us to choose for ourselves . ( There is debate over this point among the different religions ) . Thus suffering is not God 's doing but a result of our own , or other 's poor choices and actions . God can be all powerful and loving and still , innocents will suffer due to the poor choices of others . This part of the post was not to prove that a certain God exists but that your given reasons for believing that said God does n't are not completley valid . And perhaps you need to look over them again and see where you may have made invalid assumptions based on your own ideals .
Different version here too . `` No one born of a forbidden marriage nor any of his descendants may enter the assembly of the LORD , even down to the tenth generation . '' Forbidden : not permitted or allowed
But recognition of the big bang as a very good explanation of cosmology is n't limited to evolutionsits . In fact , most other scientists also believe so , most especially cosmologists and astrophysicists , who are directly concerned with the early universe . Evolutionists , even though the origin of matter and time are irrelevant to the study of evolution , are also educated in science and probably accept the work done by these other scientists .
Heres how it makes sense ; If atheists seek to support their belief system , they are more likely to accept what science tells them about topics like this without giving the details much thought . People are often short on patience you know , post # 40 indicates it . I honestly wonder if those analogies dont soar over many peoples heads . They 're not scientific , they 're common sense . But if an educated person disregards them because of impatience , or arrogance directed at the source , it can obliterate the effect of their education . It 's the difference in having been taught what to think , vs. knowing how to think . There is a reason why the most successful countries involve people besides only the educated in the political process .
That means that you view mental existence as being critical to our existence as a person . What about the body ? If we were all mind and no body ( this , granted , is purely a hypothetical and is often referred to in the hypothetical supernatural sense as a soul ) , would we still exist as people ? If not , then what would we be ? I agree that our bodies are an important part of how we view ourselves but are they part of the very core ? I would sincerely miss my legs if they had to be amputated . However , I would still exist . Taking it to the extreme , I would sincerely miss my body if all that were left was a functioning brain , but I would still exist .
Psh Leiberman is a one man party that much is true . He 's a lone wolf and by all rights I hope the whole pack of dogs eat him up ... I 'm personally getting fed up with politics ...

We need to have far better prenatal and obstetrical care for all women in the world . All truly caring human beings would endorse such care for women , as well as access to contraceptive education and access to reliable contraception to prevent such horrible consequences from pregnancy .
This has to be what the 5th time you 've been given links to educate yourself ? http : //www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC371_1.html http : //www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dinosaur/flesh.html But I do n't think you 'll understand . You fail to understand such a pedestrian concept as Erosion , I frankly do n't expect you to understand those two links . But humor me .
So we should just say `` god did it '' , and give up ?
That is one definition of creation . There are many . You again make a mistake of making an assumption about what you want to argue about , and argue against that . If you want a ( non-exhaustive list ) see http : //www.crystalinks.com/creation.html You have simply picked one model , treated it as the only one , and constructed a ( thus false ) argument against it .
So you are saying that because the gun is of value you should just let the burgular take everything else of value , Rape your wife and possibly kill you all because you might get shot ? XXXX . You are now quoting that burgulars will invade homes more because there are guns in there ? Again this is this frauds own personal research to meet his agenda . Please show me his raw data.. otherwise it is XXXX . Your quote starts out with fact ( the 74 % ) then goes off into fantasy land of the quotes of one or two CRIMINALS who support your global socialist agenda and then he does `` his own study '' . XXXX ! GOA and other pro freedom groups footnote and annotate thier sources for your review not some `` oh we looked at the fbi statistics and from `` our own '' research we have found that pistol gripped assault rifles can go on a kill crazy rampage whether or not a human is actually holding the thing '' XXXX ! The latest is the BATFE is XXXXXX at the brady foundation for misrepresenting their data ... hmm ... .. C R A P !
In other words : No , but I like to think they have ! 
Is there scientific evidence for this ?
WF , that is true and if the young lady life is endangered then to terminate the pregnancy would be appropriate but get a neutral doctor to make that decision , not one from Planned Parenthood or and abortion clinic who have a biased interest in performing abortions ... ... ... ... ... That is all I ask ... ... ... ..
I 'm still confused by this comment . Did you actually mean that ? If you did , that is not Pro-choice but Pro-abortion . Women did not have a choice in whether their pregnancies were terminated or not which , having it , is the definition of the PC point of view . So no , they were NOT Pro-choice .
Prove it then .
Sounds like the Brady Law has stopped a lot of criminals from obtaining handguns .
Which of course says volumes . On the other hand such metaphors are appropriate in many cases . For example consider the vaccination program for smallpox which eradicated the disease FAPP . It was indeed a struggle and new tools and techniques were critical to reaching the objective . From Jenner to the end of the virus as a human pathogen .
Well you just made the ultimate mistake . Trying to justify things based on your belief in God skews your views and does n't allow you to make a logical decision anyways . This has basically just become a religious debate instead of one on abortion and I think if you want to find the answer to this question you will need to debate on the Religion board . Also if everything that occurs is Gods will , then is n't it Gods will that an abortion take place if it does occur ? I wo n't debate that an aborted baby could have been responsible for an important event in the future if it had been born , but this is a rare event . I submit to you this idea as well if you like the cases of rare events . What if one of those babies grew up and killed someone who would be responsible for an important future event had he lived long enough to do so ? That is a rare case as well . I 'm sure you will say this does n't justify abortion and I 'll agree with you because both our points about low probability instances are so rare that they should n't matter in this debate anyways .
Like I said , Catholic school . Or it could be that you 're like 80 years old or something , because nowadays , if you talk about God or the Bible , then you do n't get in trouble , you get criticized and made-fun-of , not only by your peers , but also by teachers .
Which is why the `` medical establishment '' endorses smoking , drinking heavily and a fatty diet , with no excercise , because they believe we are predestined by our genes , right ? Why do you persist with these blatant lies ?
If they do n't have a violent criminal record , drug addictions , or mental illnesses , I do think they have a right to be armed . You 're starting to sound like the left-wingers , who seem to think that having money is wrong .
I ca n't imagine it either , but if I had to pick one type of business most capable of turning a government mandate into a profit , insurance companies would get my vote . I 'm afraid that too many people subconsiously think that conflicts between opposites like health providers ( or trial lawyers ) vs. insurance companies result in victory for the general public . Shandag 's comments show that they both can have common interests ( State mandates ) that result in wins for both of them and a loss for the general public .
As is yours . I 'm ready willing and able to defend mine . Are you ?
If there is a positive relationship between drug consumption and crime , it doesn`t seem very likely that crime would go down as a result of lowering the price on drugs ( and thus rasing consumption ) .
The Second Amendment does not apply to an Ohio Law . Thus , this ban is not unconstituitonal under the US Constitution . The Ohio Constitution , may however , protect gun rights , but I have n't read it .
Just looking at the REAL issues of abortion , Maineiac . Do you have a problem with that ?
Well , you would n't find a logical argument if you only read your own posts , now would you ? To find a logical argument to debate against , I would recommend 4forums.com in the creation vs. evolution section . Of course , only creationists have the honor of debating against logical arguments . Also , denying that our arguments are logical does nothing . Please attempt to refute them . We refute yours , even though we see no logic . Finally , Darwin 's Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection is not a theory in crisis in any way . Get over it .
So you 're blaming America 's higher murder rate than other developed nations on poor police work and the criminal justice system ? America already has a higher incarceration rate than other developed nations . Gun activists keep telling us we need to lock more people up and keep them locked up for longer . If that 's the standard by which criminal justice systems can be evaluated then America is doing a better job . So how can the difference in murder rates be blamed on America 's criminal justice system ?
It 's true , I find the story on sites that are generally anti-bush . However , this was a radio show transcript , not a site . Larry Flint says `` 'I 've talked to the woman 's friends , ' Flynt said . 'I 've tracked down the doctor who did the abortion , I tracked down the Bush people who arranged for the abortion , ' Flynt said . 'I got the story nailed . '' I have n't seen it either confirmed or denied by anyone more reputable .
And a lot of people are made uncomfortable by a presence of a mother breastfeeding her baby in public . You ca n't simply let standards of discomfort rule and guide the course of law . There 's no constitutional or human right to be free of discomfort and not intimidated . If you 're intimidated by somebody walking a large , powerful looking dog that could probably break your arm in its mouth , should we take steps to prevent such dogs from being owned , or walked in places where other people are present ? I 'm sure if you look you can find plenty of women who are uncomfortable in the presence of black men , for whatever reason . Should we take action to free them of their discomfort ?
There 's more to the adoption of an atheistic stance than just rejecting the bible because it 's scientifically false . 'The bible is scientific nonsense , therefore there is no god ' is not a logical stance . Modern-day citizens are far more likely to be aware of the sheer range of religious views in human cultures , past and present , and the consequent improbability that just one of them ( and hey , waddaya know ? It 's mine ! ) is wholly true and all the others wholly false . This leads some into woolly New-Age-ist pick-and-mixing ; others to conclude that the world 's religions are all the product of a similar , purely mundane , process of cultural evolution , and that none actually reflects fundamental truths .
Well then . Murder is an opinion .

You call the signing of the 1994 `` Assault Weapons Ban '' into law , which banned the sale of so-called `` assault weapons '' , simple paranoia ?
Perhaps , but as studies have noted , contributing the growing of livestock is one of top things one can do to harm the environment . `` The livestock sector is a major player [ in climate change ] , responsible for 18 % of greenhouse gas emissions measured in CO2 equivalent . This is a higher share than transport . '' I 've read that methane and nitrous oxide have greater warming potential than Co2 . Furthermore , IF the government were to become involved and create an objective to reduce meat consumption in a country I 'm sure the people would be aware as to why and make their choices . Living green is already a popular topic so many people who are not already aware of efficient energy use would eventually learn if this issue came to a front .
And how is what you or I want relevant to the evolution of organisms . Organisms `` die out '' all the time .
Why not ?
Oh sure there is ! I bet this one was printed on recycled paper .
The problem is you , Pinfold . You should n't be trying to educate these people when you do n't have even an ouce of moral clarity to base anything on .
So we havent had rulers in the past commit atrocities at a massive level when atheism wasnt as prevalent ? If I find a Christian leader who killed millions , would you accept that Christianity is just as dangerous as atheism ( and by just as dangerous I mean not at all dangerous , its the immoral people that do wrong . Now if you would like to show that crime is committed mainly by atheists ( percentage wise ) then you could have a point but until then )
Who would I trust with a firearm ? Anyone I would trust to drive a car . Until they did something to justify why they should n't have one . We are all free , until we do something that justifies the removal of our freedom . We are not born as slaves who have to qualify to receive it .
But if the Bible is the Word of God , then it is the truth , is it not ? Hence , this would be far more reliable than man-made methods . You interestingly enough bring up the so-called `` scientific dating methods '' . Well , did you know that out of the 200 possible dating methods that we can apply , only 20 of those methods bring an age for things that fits with the evolutionary theory . Since you have some education in paleontology I trust that you know that most fossils do not usually contain radioactive minerals , so they can not usually be dated by radiometric means . What is usually done is to find a volcanic flow in association with the fossil layer , and try to date that using methods such as the potassium-argon dating . Now , there have been several examples where radio-dating methods have failed . In the `` Creation Magazine '' there have been detailed reprots in which wood found in `` 250-million-year-old '' sandstone , or in volcanic rock `` tens of millions of years old '' has given carbon-dating results of only thousands of years . Now you should know that if the wood was really 250 million years old there would be no radio-carbon isotopes in the wood . Radio-carbon dating only gives dates limited to a few thousand years according to evolutionary theory . So now comes the question , which one are you going to trust ? This example came from : Snelling , A. , `` Radioactive dating in conflict ! `` , Creation 20 ( 1 ) :24-27 , 1998 . Also when creation geologists sample volcanic rock known to have flowed in historic times , sending it to reputable radiometric dating labs , such as Oxford , the `` dating '' almost invariably gives results in the millions of years ! This came from : Snelling , A. , `` Radioactive Dating Failure '' , Creation 22 ( 1 ) :18-21 , 2000 . This strongly suggests that the assumptions behind the dating methods are flawed . Now creationists do n't have all the answers when it comes to radio-active dating , but they know that there is something wrong with it , examplified by the examples above .
No you face it . Science has managed to show that life and non-life are not distinct and are indeed simply a continuium of molecular complexity and function . There is no clear difference which can separate life from molecules which are generally NOT considered to be living . There is only matter and energy found in configurations of widely differing complexity thats it so far as matter/energy at the basic temperature range we exist in . Nobody is stumped by this at all . Indeed one might well declare that life is dead - except it sounds strange .
And have a child with a terminal disease and watch them most likely die slowly because of my `` soul mate . '' Yeah . I 'm thinking if they 're willing to make me go through that they 're not a soul mate at all . > _ >
Criminals continually inform the public that their greatest fear is a victim capable of fighting back against them and possibly killing them .

Well , that is PART of the Scientific Theory of Evolution . There is more to the Scientific Theory , such as adaptation to local changes in the environment and the ability to use new niches and so on .
And thats factually ( and logically incorrect ) . There are many alternatives virtually an infinitude of them in fact .

And to put some meat on the bones of what Daewoo said about the NRA .
This is more accurate , but let me modify it a bit . Without evidence there is no reason to conclude that there MUST be a god . A lack of evidence does not ensure that there is no god , just that we ca n't assume that there is .
Well gee , that 's what I spent all that time trying to explain to you . Perhaps you want to go back to that discussion , and not segue off onto other topics ?
Why not ? There 's no rules that say faith and science must be separate .
That & # 8217 ; s not the problem . The problem is how do you account for all the different species that are on the earth today coming from what you say were on the ark ?
someone needs to go over to IIDB and invite those kooks over here to debate me on this thread . There 's currently an open thread over there with my name on it ... seems they like obsessing over me ... .they 're like a bunch of teeny boppers obsessing and salivating over a Backstreet Boy .
The first Christians were Jews . Anyone who claims to be a Christian but hates Jews is a XXXXX . An anti-Semetic Christian is like an oxymoron term . And an Aryan is supposed to be someone with blue-eyes , brown-hair , and light-skin . You do n't have to believe in 'Aryanism ' to be Aryan , and the mortal enemies of Aryans are not Jews . 'Aryans ' may hate Jews , but most Jews are n't bigoted . By the way , Hitler did not like just Jews but others he considered 'inferior ' to the 'superior ' 'Aryan race .

My life was a gift from my parents , no more , no less . When i look in the mirror , i do not see an embryo . If someone gives you something , they have every right to take it away if they feel you are not suited to handle it , or if they had second thoughts . I would think this was ok if the baby was stopped in an earlier stage , but once its in its third trimester , you have no right to kill it .
It could be argued that the delays in germanies advancement due to armed civil defenses gave the allies a chance to mobilize . IT is a case of `` what might have happened '' , though , so it is impossible to tell for sure . With Hitler you had a unique situation which involved a tyrant and a lunatic in charge of a country , but with the popular support of the population . I would have to agree that resistance against Hitler did n't lead to any great victories . Of course , ( and playing `` might have been again '' ) if more people had realised what kind of threat he actually posd , perhaps the resistance would have been more popular and successful . [ QUOTE } The rest of your post I maybe reply to later , but it is always exhausting to write against any uncited and unproven claims ...

So a law that is applied equally is discriminatory ? Sounds like doublethink .
I believe the OP misspoke ; I *think* the question ought to have been 'Is marriage a civil or religious rite ? ' . Hopefully they can post back and confirm .
Really ? Okay , let 's just kill them all then .
Well it is n't true in the US .
A specific age is picked because it occurs sometime and there is no way to know in any specific individual whether their pre-frontal cortex is up to snuff or not . There is no way to judge on a case-by-case basis . If this occurs ( I think it 's clear that it does ) and if this is a rational reason for treating persons differently ( that is , of course , arguable ) then the line must be drawn somewhere . I was wrong to say 18 is arbitrary . I misused the word . I would assume that most people have a mature CNS by that age , so that is why it is picked . The objective evidence of this is done looking at populations , not individuals . Subjectively , anyone who has kids will know that a young teen 's judgement is pretty bizarre at times .
Nope . However , he does get to pay child support if he gets caught .

So , you post a press release from the brookings institute , one that they could not even get any news agencies to pick up and print , and then accuse me of biased sources ? Thats pretty rich . There is a fair to decent article about this at http : //www.cnsnews.com/ViewCulture.a ... 20030127a.html Realistically , I do n't know how many gun control laws there are nationwide . I know that the report cited by the brookings XXXXXX admits to ONLY reporting federal and state laws , but not local ( I know that there are 34 local gun control laws where I live , including the all important one prohibiting you from carrying a shotgun into a feed store ) . This seems to me to be akin to counting up federal and state zoning ordnances and then claiming that there are only 300 laws about zoning in the US .
Oh really , what specific rulings by the 1st , 3rd , and 10th circuit courts are you referring to ? I 've read the rulings by the 1st , 3rd , and 10 circuits courts on the matter and I do n't understand what you 're talking about . `` Appellant , Peter B. Thomas , argues that the City of Portland , Maine , and various city officials infringed his constitutional rights by denying him a permit to carry a concealed handgun . Established case law makes clear that the federal Constitution grants appellant no right to carry a concealed handgun . See , e.g. , United States v. Miller , 307 U.S. 174 , 178 , 59 S.Ct . 816 , 818 , 83 L.Ed . 1206 ( 1939 ) ( second amendment applies only to weapons that have a 'reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia . ' ) '' Thomas v. Members of City Council of Portland ( 1st Cir . 1984 ) `` Appellant Raymond Rybar , Jr. was convicted following a conditional guilty plea to two counts of violating 18 U.S.C . Section ( s ) 922 ( o ) , which makes it 'unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machine gun . ' On appeal , he argues that the district court erred in rejecting his challenge to that provision as beyond Congress ' commerce power and as violating the Second Amendment . Neither challenge is persuasive ... .In support , Rybar cites , paradoxically , the Supreme Court decision in United States v. Miller , 307 U.S. 174 ( 1939 ) , where the Court upheld the constitutionality of a firearms-registration requirement against a Second Amendment challenge . Rybar draws on that holding , relying on the Miller Court 's observation that the sawed-off shotgun in question had not been shown to bear 'some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia . ' Brief of Appellant at 24-25 ; Miller , 307 U.S. at 178 . Drawing from that language the contra positive implication , Rybar suggests that because the military utility of the machine guns proscribed by Section ( s ) 922 ( o ) is clear , a result contrary to that reached in Miller is required , and the statute is therefore invalid under the Second Amendment ... .We note first that however clear the Court 's suggestion that the firearm before it lacked the necessary military character , it did not state that such character alone would be sufficient to secure Second Amendment protection . In fact , the Miller Court assigned no special importance to the character of the weapon itself , but instead demanded a reasonable relationship between its 'possession or use ' and militia related activity ... .Rybar 's invocation of this statute does nothing to establish that his firearm possession bears a reasonable relationship to 'the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia , ' as required in Miller , 307 U.S. at 178. `` U.S. v. Rybar ( 3rd . Cir . 1996 ) `` the courts consistently have found no conflict between federal gun laws and the Second Amendment , narrowly construing the latter to guarantee the right to bear arms as a member of a militia ... . '' United States v. Graves ( 3rd Cir . 1977 ) `` The purpose of the second amendment as stated by the Supreme Court in United States v. Miller , supra at 178 , 59 S.Ct . 816 , was to preserve the effectiveness and assure the continuation of the state militia . '' United States v. Oakes ( 10th Cir . 1977 )
No , it is not counter to any agenda , it is a historical fact ! If you turn on your allies during time of war , why trust them in time of peace ? Your countrymen got sunk by the Brit disarmament plan as soon as the elite were safe and you are ecstatic about it ? Good correlation as to why tyrants refuse to allow the populace arms so they can remain slaves . Free men are armed !

It is n't sickening . Somewhat irresponsible , maybe , but not sickening . At that age they should have gotten parental permission from each child 's parent to go on the trip , but that 's the only thing I see wrong about it .
Just for you then I 'm not really sure why you would say its a point overlooked though , its pretty much the point of the pro-choice movement more or less . We do n't think a fetus has a negative value and that its best to be rid of as many as possible , its just that they do n't have the same value as the well being of the woman . That said I probably would n't use terms like 'inherent value ' as I do n't belieive in that sort of thing . I think that in the context of our society and the rules that allow us to live the lives we more or less want then we need to recognise other people 's rights regardless of gender . Its a lot more important to me for a woman to be able to have an abortion than it is for a fetus not to be able to be aborted as the former will have consquences for me but the latter wo n't ( or at least greatly reduced and less definite ones ) . Its more or less what seperates them from plants and animals ( though its a bit wierd one this last point and I 'm a massive hypocrite when its comes to this ) .
Ok , this makes sense . I do think however , that wanted pregnancies should be a part of the abortion debate , even though as you say , they usually are not . Part of the abortion issue ( and the most important part , IMO ) is the perception of pregnancy itself . If society moves in a direction where having a baby is looked upon as a negative thing , this is not good . One way to help make abortion rarer is to help people view having a baby as a positive thing . As Clinton himself once said , abortion should be rare .

Nope . No contradiction from Old to New . Deut 20 : 1 When you go out to battle against your enemies , and see horses and chariots , a people more than you , you shall not be afraid of them . For Jehovah your God is with you , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt . 2 And it shall be , when you draw near to battle , the priest shall come and speak to the people , 3 and say to them . Hear , Israel , you are drawing near today to battle against your enemies . Do not let your heart be faint ; do not fear nor tremble , nor be terrified before their faces . 4 For Jehovah your God is He who is going before you , to fight for you with your enemies , to save you . 5 And the officers shall speak to the people , saying , who is the man that has built a new house , and has not dedicated it ? Let him go and return to his house , that he not die in battle and another man dedicate it . 6 And who is the man that has planted a vineyard , and has not used its fruit ? Let him go and return to his house , that he not die in battle , and another man use its fruit . 7 And who is the man who has betrothed a woman , and has not taken her ? Let him go and return to his house , that he not die in the battle , and another man take her . 8 And the officers shall speak further to the people , and say , Who is the man who is afraid , and faint of heart ? Let him go and return to his house ; then the heart of his brothers will not melt like his heart . 9 And it shall be , when the officers have finished speaking to the people , commanders of the armies shall be appointed at the head of the people . 10 When you come near a city to fight against it , then call to it for peace . 11 And it shall be , if it answers peace to you , and shall open to you , then it shall be that all the people found in it shall be forced laborers for you , and shall serve you . 12 And if it shall not make peace with you , and shall make war with you , then you shall lay siege against it . 13 And Jehovah your God shall give it into your hand ; and you shall strike every male of it by the mouth of the sword . 14 Only , the women , and the little ones , and the livestock , and all in the city , all its plunder , you shall seize for yourself . And you shall eat the plunder of your enemies which Jehovah your God has given to you . 15 So you shall do to all the cities very far away from you , which are not of the cities of these nations . 16 But of the cities of these peoples which Jehovah your God is giving to you as an inheritance , you shall not keep alive any that breathes . 17 But you shall utterly destroy them the Hittites , and the Amorites , the Canaanites , and the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites , as Jehovah your God has commanded you ; 18 so that they may not teach you to do according to all their filthy deeds which they have done for their gods ; and you would sin against Jehovah your God . 19 When you shall lay siege to a city many days , to fight against it , to capture it , you shall not destroy its trees in order to force an axe against them . For you shall eat of them , and you shall not cut them down , for is the tree of the field a man that it should be used by you to lay siege ? 20 Only the tree which you know not to be a fruit tree , you may destroy it , and may cut it down , and may build a bulwark against the city making war with you , until you have subdued it .

So , tell me , if it is ALWAYS life-threatening , why are there so few life-threatening conditions mentioned above ? I agree that pregnancy can tax a person 's system , but so does exercise , the flu , and a million other things and only , rarely , do these result in death . In fact , I 'm willing to bet that you 're more likely to die from the flu than pregnancy . Want to take me up on the bet ? Oh and my `` love '' of PP stems from my knowledge of its original goal and current practices .

Make up your mind . Above you were claiming that there is evidence of your god and now you are claiming that it is a matter of faith . My faith is something different from evolution . I take nothing in science by faith . Science is based on empirical evidence - that means the I can quantify it in some way . Of course , if there is empirical evidence for your god , then your god is not supernatural but just another part of the universe . But is n't it funny that you creationists always think that the worst insult you can throw at science is to call it faith ? Sadly , you are unable to reject the dogma of the mythology of ancient , nomadic herdsmen . To assert that as science is certainly not thinking for oneself .

The likely flaw of this argument is defining Communism . Communism as defined by Marx and Engel has never been implemented . Furthermore , Communism as defined by Marx and Engel IS democracy . Often people either forget that or have no idea what Communism is . Historically , Communist supporting ideology candidates that have won democratic elections have been removed by force ( or attempted ) by Western powers . Chile , Nicaragua , Guatemala , several African nations including Mozambique , the list is actually quite long .
These are n't the only two options available . The many philosophical views of the material world or ethics do n't mean these two things do n't exist .
And ? What relevance does this have to PP today ?
Not at all . The theory of evolution contains many many things .

So much for lists of registration and `` safe storage '' . Same thing happened when Hitler took over a country and got hold of all the lists . They were especially interested in the gun lists and radio lists .
So it 's just a coincidence that nations that ban guns like England have much lower levels of gun violence and murder than the US ? That 's kind of hard to believe . NYC was so effective in reducing crime that the mayor of NYC was invited to Mexico City to help them reduce crime there . So I do n't think the possibility that gun control has been effective in cities like NYC can be ruled out . You may be confusing cause and effect . You would n't walk into a hospital and declare that because there are a lot of sick people in a hospital that hospitals do n't help people get better . That website starts off with the rumor that there are over 20,000 gun laws . Although this claim has been repeated numerous times by anti gun-control activists , has anybody been able to verify this claim ? A recent study that counted the number of gun laws found `` only 300 relevant federal and state laws regarding the manufacture , design , sale , purchase , or possession of guns . '' http : //releases.usnewswire.com/GetRelease.asp ? id=12007 Another reason not to put too must trust in biased websites that cherry pick the facts .
Oh , if we only had the requisite absolute civilian gun bans , sick things like this would never happen ! Huh Brady ?
So if the laws did n't apply here because of it being a reservation , stricter laws would not change anything ( unless ammended to apply ) . But even so , the killer would still have gotten the guns because the person he got them from had the right and duty to have them .
If God transported them , we immediately have removed the flood myth from the realm of science . As if the flood itself did not do this already ...
But they ca n't be true christians if they accept evolution .
Actually its a pretty accurate interpretation . Take for instance the money spent by the catholic church promoting abortion restrictions , yet their tax exempt status has never seriously been called into question , that I know of . The fact of the matter is a couple hundred G 's is a drop in the bucket for an organization the size of the LDS church , so proving that it is a substantial portion of their activities under section 501 would be difficult at best .
Well that is a problem for the ardent creationist is n't it ? Or for any Christian . The Bible says that God can not lie . Tts 1:2 In hope of eternal life , which God , that can not lie , promised before the world began ; Num 23:19 God [ is ] not a man , that he should lie ; neither the son of man , that he should repent : hath he said , and shall he not do [ it ] ? or hath he spoken , and shall he not make it good ? You see the Bible says that God promises never to send a flood to destroy the whole earth again : Gen 9:15 And I will remember my covenant , which [ is ] between me and you and every living creature of all flesh ; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh . If the flood were a local flood , as some say , then God is a liar . There have been many local floods througout history . If God is a liar , then the Bible is not the word of God and can not be trusted . Consider this excercise in logic : If God is who he says he is in the Bible , and his very voice created the universe , then can God lie ? If light did n't exist , and then God said let there be light and light then existed -- if there is that sort of creative power in the Word of God -- can God lie ? Imagine if you had that kind of power in your voice . Whatever you said became true for all eternity . If you contradicted yourself , one reality would be destroyed for another , would n't it ? If God said `` let there be light , and there was light '' where light had not been before , then what would happen if God were to lie about the earth ? Would n't the former be destroyed and the new become reality ? In the Bible , Jesus says `` I am the way , the Truth , and the light '' . How can someone `` be '' the truth , unless they are a God with the power of creation in their voice . You see , if any part of the Bible is a lie , then the whole idea of God and Jesus comes crumbling down like a house of cards .
Well earlier you seemed interested in the idea that a loophole might exist that allowed people to avoid taxes . In this case I was only suggesting that a loophole could exist which allows companies to save money by hiring gay people instead of straight people in order to cut health insurance costs . As I said , it is n't really a strong argument , but maybe an interesting one .
Bull XXXX . Best I can tell , our Creationist is confusing CAN with CERTAINLY WILL . In certain cases , a specific single nucleotide change CAN be lethal , but that 's not at all what the Creationist is claiming . Although this is an imperfect analogy , to see the general flaw in his logic , consider this statement : `` Science has now shown that being in a car accident is completely fatal . ''
Really ? What a surprise ! So tell me . If you do n't know what it is or how it works , how do you know that you are opposed to it ?
And what does he mean by that ? You apparently do n't have a clue . Tell me , do you have any idea what `` secondary cause '' is ?
I think that getting your tubes tied is a responsible act . I was just inquiring about the motive for doing so . Too bad more women ( and men ) do n't share your level of responsibility . If they did , we would n't need to debate the `` need '' for abortions .
... so where does cancer come from ? Is n't that 'cells producing something other than what they are ' ? Come to that ... given that all humans start out as a single cell , that 's definitely false .
Another lie . The sentence you 've quoted never made any such argument .
So since you admit there 's been a `` radical change '' in biology do you still think neo-darwinism explains evolution ? If so , how ... if not ... what is your new explantion ?
That 's not exactly true now , is it ? People get to vote for elected officials , and that 's all that 's guaranteed federally . Some states have provisions for allowing people to vote on local laws , but in some states the government is allowed to prevent the vote . And of course there is no provision at all allowing the people to vote on federal laws . So in point of fact it is a true statement that in the United States someone is not allowed to vote on X , for some values of X .
Ok. You do n't want to do it because you do n't want to do that to your body . Do you support other 's right to do it despite not wanting to do it to yourself ?
You must be smoking a really strong stuff . The only system where resources are not scarce is the communism of Karl Marx .
I 've lived in the Bible Belt ( little rock , ark . ) and maybe I still do ( nashville ) , and the majority of average middle class people there were quite southern baptist and pentacostal ( in nashville it 's Church of christ or assemblies of god , whatever that is ) . But , I 'm not so sure how they stand on creationism . I 'll bet a lot of them just go ahead and believe something close to genesis ( not literal ) , but surely they do n't totally discount evolution ( at least the people I have met and have known ) . But , if you asked them if it takes faith to believe evolution , they will all say `` Yes , it 's just a shaky unproven theory that requires faith to accept . '' And that makes them feel better about believing the absurd .
What foundits attitude proves is that the homosexual agenda 's standard claim for decades now that it is `` EQUALITY '' which they seek has been nothing more than a huge smoke screen which I have been saying in every debate we have ever had . When a compromise plan is recommended and is working fine in France , which gives them every single right of social and economic equality they have ever asked for , that still is n't enough . They wont rest until they redefine marriage for the rest of us . I 'll bet the Goodridges would love this plan , in hindsight . First Same-Sex Couple to Marry in the U.S . Files for Divorce
I know , I just could n't resist lol ... it was more for me than anyone else .
And you 've failed to explain exactly how Heller was a blank check endorsement on schemes such as gun rationing . Explain exactly how the judges ruling that the Second Amendment is truly an individual right , how DC 's ban on handgun ownership and their trigger lock requirements being unconstitutional , would in any way suggest that one-gun-a-month laws pass constitutional muster . Furthermore how to you reconcile the effects of gun rationing , with the fact that such laws make it absolutely impossible to catch gun traffickers in the act ? Give us some straight answers or leave the debate !
Incredibly enough , ignoring my rebuttal does n't make you right .
I agree with that . Several companies made enough extended magazines in anticipation of the ban that they 're still available for a reasonable price ten years later . As a business person the only question is going to be if grandfather rights will again be available if new legislation is passed . I spoke with a gun dealer I know who said manufacturer distributors are already calling dealers trying to determine what post-ban demand might be for pre-ban configurations . Bushmasters will be selling like hotcakes .
Not global warmings existence , global warmings CAUSE . Does it come as a shock to you that the cause of global warming is controversial ? http : //www.canadafreepress.com/2007/ ... ming020507.htm There was also a piece of a formal debate about it on these forums . It was so lopsided , the global-warming-is-caused-by-man advocate fled the debate halfway through .
and your point is ?
I think others corrected you nicely on the future thing , but I would like to add that the only way humans are the only sentient beings is if we define sentient as something only humans are . If sentient merely means self-aware , I ca n't tell my cat 's self-awareness from my own , so I really could n't say who 's sentient and who 's not .
The militia of the Second Amendment is a militia that is described as being well regulated ( regulated by both the federal government and the states as spoken of in Article 1 of the Constitution ) . In our own day , I think the National Guard would be the only militia that qualifies as being well regulated . Alexander Hamilton spoke of the desirability of the militia being well regulated : `` It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects , whenever they were called into service for the public defense . It would enable them to discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army ; and it would fit them much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be essential to their usefulness . This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority . It is , therefore , with the most evident propriety , that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the Union `` to provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining the militia , and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States , RESERVING TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS , AND THE AUTHORITY OF TRAINING THE MILITIA ACCORDING TO THE DISCIPLINE PRESCRIBED BY CONGRESS . '' The Federalist Papers - THOMAS ( Library of Congress ) We could go back to the days when most citizens were required to enroll in the militia , have guns and get military training- to what the Founders really meant when they spoke of a well regulated militia being the security of a free state . But the Supreme Court along with pro-gun activists claiming to be pro- Second Amendment have decided to turn their back on that part of the Second Amendment while giving the lip service to the idea of a militia .
Oops , I think YOU made a mistake here on the second one . This is the correct inequality based off of my original equation . e-c < e+c So , start over again .
Your view of choice is your belief . I do n't `` believe '' that a pregnant woman or anyone else should be able to choose for the child . That child does not have a choice . Choosing to kill someone is a choice , but it is not a choice that should be legal . Therefore , you are forcing your view of `` choice '' on me by making abortion ( murder ) illegal .
And they are the `` adept '' ones who agree they understand it are not they ? How do you know they have truly got the thing ? You must accept it by faith since you are not amongst the `` precious few '' who are inspired to understand it . It is strange that Newton 's formulas can be understood without being accepted into the secret society of evolutionary magicians .
You 'll have to ask gnojek that . It appears he thinks that any pronouncement by a scientist suggesting CO2 production is a problem is a conspiracy theory by scientists to get bigger budgets : `` As scientists we will tell you that there is a major problem that can only be solved through science , which can only be done with money . We 're scientists and we really like grant money to do research . Would n't it be great if we had a global initiative to fund this research indefinitely , or until the global warming problem is solved ... '' It 's the YEC movement all over again : there 's no proof , the evidence could be interpreted either way , it 's a scientific conspiracy theory , the Devil is behind it : it 's un-Christian to cut back on fossil fuel burning etc
Actually , the dating is done on layers above and below the rock in which fossils are found . You see , generally fossils are found in some sort of sedimentary rock . And sedimentary rock can not be dated . But a layer of volcanic ash above and below the fossil can be dated and thus give a date within a range .
And yet here we are and neo-Darwinism continues to have empirical support right and left with no sign of it being falsified in sight as of yet . Why might that be ? And you Bertvan do not exist since you are so highly improbable . Therefore I can safely assume that your post above just happened without your existense .
Yeah , all the theologians who 've puzzled over this problem for centuries have just been bad Christians in the clutches of atheists . -sigh-
Well is this serious science or is this ring-around-the-rosie on Sesame Street ? Am I just supposed to play make-believe and/or use my imagination ? I can do that -- for instance , when I play with my kids , I 'm real good at playing the role of `` Ken '' when we imagine that `` Barbie goes to the beach '' Surely the fossil record shows gradualism or not . I bought a book a while back at a half-price bookstore from Niles Eldredge called The Myths of Evolution . He says the following about gradualism : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Change in this manner ( gradualism ) is just not found in the fossil record . pg . 48 Darwin invented the myth that species were not real to convince the world of the nonmyth that evolution had occured . pg . 52 Darwin 's prediction that long-term evolutionary change should produce a systematic pattern of gradual , progressive change in the fossil record was faulty . pg . 53 As we have seen in the previous chapter , the usual conception casts evolution as a gradual , steady process of adaptive change . And we have already seen that the fossil record conflicts with that view . pg . 57 We 're faced more with a great leap of faith -- that gradual , progressive , adaptive change underlies the general pattern of evolutionary change we see in the rocks -- than any hard evidence . pg . 57 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I guess I would consider myself more of a PE guy than a gradualist simply because of what the fossils indicate . It seems to me that instead of evolving gradually that animals evolve quickly -- like the spiders on my shed . ( do you find it odd that they emerged yellow in the spring ? ) It seems butterflies have this same ability ... ..Evolution sure is amazing ! For instance , Monteiro said , the darker wing patterns that show up in butterflies that emerge in the spring serve to warm up the butterfly faster , whereas butterflies that emerge in the summer have lighter colors . `` Also , many butterflies that emerge in the wet season in the tropics have large , conspicuous marks on their wings that deflect the attacks of predators while the butterflies are actively finding mates and laying eggs , while the dry-season cohorts are very cryptic , trying to blend in with their environment and not attract any attention from predators until the rains arrive again , '' she said http : //unisci.com/stories/20021/0313021.htm Where can I find an explanation about this phenomenon ? Does Darwin talk about this ? This is fascinating to me ... .I ca n't seem to find anything about this at TalkOrigins .
Your mama , your wife , your sista , mista .
So there are `` ancient extinct reptiles '' to you ? These things indeed existed on Earth right ? In the creationist framework , when were these things on the Earth ? 5000 years ago ? Before the flood , after the flood ? Did Noah have dinosaurs ( sorry , ancient extinct reptiles ) on the ark ?
They are : those that survive better reproduce more . Members of a species can die if other members have better food/light/attention/camaflouge .
To expound on my last post : And yet this is taken to be fact unanimously in our history books . Funny how easy this book gets a pass . If we think it 's Homer then for this book , that 's good enough . But not so with the Bible . There can be absolutely no kernel of uncertainty , which in ancient texts , ambiguity is unavoidable . In regards to who wrote these books , the best evidence we have leads to Homer . Therefore , we decide it is almost certainly Homer who is the author . This is undisputed . However , in regards to the Bible , skeptics overturn the use of Occam 's Razor and require more than adequate proof of the Bible 's claims . Even though the Bible is the most heavily documented writing of its day , still skeptics require more in order to believe the Gospels are actually true . Double standard much ?
Yes you can it is called belonging to a religious group . Which should not be protected as it is only a choice .
There is the ever popular `` smartest state '' report that places kansas at # 15 in the nation . It can be found at http : //www.morganquitno.com/edrank.htm A lot of kansas educators take exception to that report because it factors in things that may not be related . For example , Kansas kids score in the top 5 states in ALL testing categories , BUT , we score 38th in spending per pupil . We score poorly in teacher salaries ( 28 ) , and do not have teachers on our school boards ( conflict of interest ) . All those factors count against us , as well as several others . Then you have new jersey and vermont , where the kids apparently ca n't take a test , and where their average SAT scores may be confused with a shoe size , and they score in the top 5 because they spend a LOT more than kansas . A lot of people argue that they penalize states for efficiency in their education system . If you want the most comprehensive report out there , go to www.alec.org and request a copy of their `` report card for education '' . I think it is free , and it breaks down the states by several categories . It is what I always used to figure out how good a job our system was doing .
Is it productive an exericee to make such generalisations which are in effect a product of a priori notions that anyone who is religious is irrational anyway ?
It is . What do you know about it ?
I agree , for the most part . Once you get to tanks and helicopters though ? Too big , too easy a target for a tyrannical regime . Do you see the Iraqis and Afghanis using tanks and helicopters ? I 'm sure they could get them if they really wanted , but they 're useless against a government that invests in satellite technology and bombers . Better to stick with the rocket launchers and mines .
With regard to this statement you have to consider : 1 . How can anyone know what product an `` intelligent designer '' wanted . 2 . Even from the example of life on Earth we can clearly see there is nothing easy at all about the path life has taken over the millenia . But I think it is possible to hold your position , although it can be a tricky one by virtue of the entrenchment of opinions that has occured in the religion science debate- due to the less than pragmatic attiudes of some of the participants .
Well considering heredity does not lie reside in our genes , but in the way our genome reacts with the environment , ( including induced thoughts , beliefs , feelings , sensations , cultural traditions , internal and external contexts , etc ) then it pretty much is when it comes to heredity .
Is the glass half empty or half full ? ? We are wining rights in some states and losing in others . Soon we will be a country divided , oh wait ... we already are .
Archie is NOT right - he has an opinion , as we all do . Pro-lifers seem to want the definition of human with attendant rights to begin at conception . The blastocyst is now turning into a tumour . So the pro-lifers can now alter their views on what constitutes 'human ' as and when it suits their purpose . Forget the emotive view of what an embryo/foetus looks like : some think that as long as it has appendages and looks human , then it IS . It is n't . It 's still a parasitic organism dependant on the host mother . You ca n't deny that . Contraception v. abortion is a separate issue : in the meantime , the host mother should be the final arbiter of what happens to her body .
. This is the most obscene , disgusting and down right vilest thing i have ever had the misfortune to come across.Do you watch the news or read the papers , because it was all over the national news and the papers so much in fact that the goverment set up an inquiry , and a commitee to deal with it . To say my sons body was salvage is bang out of order and i would thank you to think about the effect that your uncaring words have on people . How long have been on this board , because it is all over the place that fishx { my wife } is staunchly pro life and it would of been more helpful for your case than asking such a stupid question as to ask if she had had an abortion . You live in good old blighty and yet claim no knowledge of what was going on do you not remember alder hey childrens hospital.The system you are discussing is the same system that you live under , it was hope hospital in salford that took my babys body and never returned it .
whatever .
Good- we were tired of you not responding or saying , `` it is n't worth my time . ''
Well , I 'd say that since that sort of question do n't have a pat and universal answer , then that 's why they should n't have been asked in the first place , in this case . My view is that questions over a job like this should be about a person 's qualifications .
Because there are no ACLU lawsuits when Dawkin 's book is required reading in public schools . We have to more and more , as atheism is established .
Yes it is , however , it was YOU on the opening post who claimed they were still alive . Let me quote you again :
This is obviously not talking about abortion .
I know I am raising my away as far away from the `` right '' way as possible . Get it ? wuka wuka wuka
Which then would NOT be omnipotent/omniscient .
Now you 're claiming that a gun is a precision machine . Before you 've claimed that the guns you classify as `` assault weapons '' are `` inaccurate and designed for be fired from the hip '' . Which is it ?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ! rotflmao . yOU just committed suicide , ugh , gory !
Let me make your accusations correct . ************************************************** ***************** Now , after that , for once you 're telling the truth .
No .
Actually what they are really doing is ignoring silly irrelevent questions from clueless people with a religious agenda to promote .
I 've been around the creationist/science discussions for a number of years , about 20 or so . The `` you believe in evolution '' argument has been around for at least that long . In my experience it has been a waste of breath to try to convince creationists that I do n't believe in evolution any more than they do . As I recall , the argument was even presented in a court case back in the late 60s , or maybe it was the early 80s . I could be wrong . I 'll have to check on that .
And I 'm going to correct you again . The theory of evolution is by no means an extreme view . It is the prevailing view . More than 99 % of biologists accept the theory of evolution as the best explanation for the observations .
Would you ask the same of an environmentalist ? Would you ask him to pay for buying the all of the rainforests he hopes to save ? The scientific research ? etc . Would you ask this of any other cause except the abortion one ? This is faulty reasoning . No one who supports any cause is expected to pay for the entirety of that cause . BUT anti-abortionists do pay for quite a bit in this regard . There are help centers all over the nation . Have n't you seen the signs ? `` Call if you are pregnant and in need of assistance . ''
It was n't meant as an insult ... just a statement of fact . I likely have as many or more inadequacies than do you .
It does n't matter if it 's 'earth shattering ' or not . By admitting that we hold different standards for the Bible proves my entire point : hypocrisy on the part of skeptics .
So you bought the lie . Can you even show me one federal government promise that has n't been broken , turned into a scam , robbed then the blank securities sold off as a grab for more stolen monies ? H e double l , they ca n't fulfill the promises from the last health care scam and promises to fund Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid but you buy the new promise sight unseen with anticipation and hope ? The Silent Entitlements Monster : Social Security , Medicare And Interest On The Debt Will Gobble Up Every Single Tax Dollar By 2020 With promises come responsibility ... to the taxpayer and receipient . Pure socialism has never survived and never will . it is the nature of the beast . What do you think all these folks are going to do when they find a massive new program that gobbles up their taxes and defaults on the first SS program ? Bring back the guillotines ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Most folks can identify armed robbery but obviously you ca n't . Meanwhile , back at the DRMO , the second attempt to destroy brass and shred it for a fraction of the price to keep reloading companies from bidding on it at a higher price is underway . Our elected perps are selling out again to a foreign drummer . Used to , higher prices for brass and copper meant one of two things , a war or a period of economic expansion . When government tightens ammunition supply it is not a good sign for the subjects . Reflect on that and imagine how the retired folks will react to unfullfilled lies and outright deceit when the promise and contract is broken . Keep imagining you are going to get free health care when the government defaults on the long term promise of retirement . Try to buy the lie and sell the fact ... you lose again
Perhaps you should go get a bit of education on the subject bud - embalming is not fossilization , nor are they comparable ... ... ...
Since you decided not to abort the ones you DID have , that actually makes you 'pro-life ' to some degree .
so what about the idea , though , that if I move into a new location and my subconscious mind generates a new physical trait to adapt me to the situation . In this way my mere thoughts ( non-physical ) would be creating a new physical body ... aka , getting something from nothing -- pulling a rabbit out of a hat . ( I can show you numerous examples of this in the animal kindom if you wish . ) Also , what about non-locality . I could post some some weird stuff from physics ... any of that count ? I 'm trying to pin down what is considered `` miracle . '' And why does God have to be involved in a `` miracle '' anyway ? ... what if I were to believe that since humans were created in the image of God that we are all capable ( or at least have the capacity ) of performing our own miracles ? O , Ye of little faith -- Jesus
very true . logic exists whether people are there to grasps its concepts or not . where we disagree is at your assumption that god created logic . how can this be ? logic is not contingent on any intelligent entity , whether it be man or god , to exist . the logic of increasing a quantity by adding to it would remain whether god existed or not . you have yet to tie the existence of logic to god as its cause
I would like to propose reasons that the theory of evolution is in jeopardy . First , you must realize that evolution is still a theory . Otherwise it would be called the Law of Evolution . We have the laws of physics , the laws of chemistry , the laws of mathematics , the laws of thermodynamics . These are all proved and documented and provide the basis of all our technology . They are true and wholeheartedly accepted by everyone . They are the Laws of the Universe . For evolution to become a law , it must fall in line with the other laws . There can be no contradictions . The truth must be the truth . The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that Entropy must remain the same or increase . Entropy is the tendency toward chaos . Increasing entropy means increasing chaos . The universe is winding down on an irreversible path . Every process that takes place in nature , whether mechanical , electrical , chemical , or biological is winding down , becoming more chaotic . All processes will finally cease , and the Universe will stop . That is a scientific fact . If the Universe is running down , becoming more chaotic all the time , how is it possible for any material to suddenly become more orderly , more organized , more complex . Scientists say , that random encounters of atoms , molecules , joining and splitting , eventually create order . I 'm sorry , that 's in direct contradiction to the Second Law . It would also violate the statisically probability of such an occurrence even over billions of years , especially in light of the complexity of organized biological systems and processes . Which brings me to the second reason that evolution is in jeopardy : there is a huge difference between living and non-living things . There is a gigantic leap forward required to produce even a single-celled amoeba from a goo that contains all the elements required to make an amoeba . The goo is total chaos . The amoeba is a highly organized and complex living creature . The odds of random mixing by weather , earthquake , etc . that would produce an amoeba would be one in a billion billion billion . It 's not going to happen . Thirdly , look at DNA . Scientists are mapping the human genome , the very basis of life itself . What are they finding ? Recorded information that literally contains the blueprint of a human being . Information so complex and so vast that it is taking literally years to decipher . And every bit of the human body carries DNA . Theorically , it is possible to take this blueprint and create a whole new human . How can a living creature so complex be an accident of nature ? Fourth , how do you explain human consciousness ? How does this highly complex body of flesh and blood with its organic brain have the ability to not only be aware of the world , but also be aware of himself as a unique person ? There is no biological or medical reason determined so far , despite decades of study . What freak accident could possibly have occurred to give the first descendant of apes the first spark of awareness ?
and ? ? ? ? ? ? ... that did n't answer my question .
If it is that new , then it is not universally accepted ( even within biologists ) .
Our pumping of CO2 is certaintly not helping . Does that mean we should pump gasses and make people in big cities sneeze ?
Because a large portion of people in jail now are there on drug-related charges .
Oh yeah , like that has n't been tried before /sarcasm It darn sure is n't about crime control . No doubt some nefarious excuse to farther control the people and attempt to charge user fees to discourage a right . No doubt sinjin will approve so `` they '' can match fingerprints and type of ammo to the DROS registration file ?
Funny , my religion is n't 'secularism ' and we deny the absolute sanctity of life . To sacrifice anyone to the interests of others , to deny them the quality of life to which they are entitled , is an evil proposition . In affirming the absolute sanctity of life , we deny the sanctity of particular lives by putting them at the disposal of others - in the case of abortion , affirming the absolute sanctity of the baby 's life involuntarily subordinates the mother to the child .
Well , youre just begging the question of what is evidence . You are saying religious belief ( others might say religious knowledge ) is not evidence . If it is scientific , it is evidence . If it is not scientific , it is not evidence . Have I got it right ?
Oh yeah , that 's just side-splitting hilarious . . .
You forgot selection . Selection is the opposite of chance .
So , is a giant Panda a bear ? Or some other `` kind '' ?
But the Court went further than necessary . They set the point at which States could legally impose restrictions on abortion negating many state statutes in the process and establishing the `` right to abortion '' ON DEMAND at any time . That was an exercise in judicial activism . They took statures that existed in many states and arbitrarily determined at what point they could be applied . It 's not the Court 's function to legislate from the bench . It is up to the States and Federal Legislatures to determine at what point the fetus ' rights are protected .
You think someone deserves to be beaten into unconsciousness with a bat for trying to steal a TV ?
And that is why they are referred to as creationists and not merely as christians . They are only a small subset of the huge christian population .
And your point is ?
Cite me one . The only time I see `` junk DNA '' in the literature , there 's quote marks around it . We call it `` non-coding DNA . '' Barbarian observes : That happens , too . For example , our gene for vitamin C is broken and no longer works . .
Well then you 'd be dead wrong ! Look at California , New York , New Jersey , and all other states with gun registration , and the number of firearms-related crimes and stolen guns that they have . And just because you ticked me off with this post of yours I 'm gon na prove to you that you 're wrong . As it is now we already have a backdoor form of gun registration ; the ATF has sales records for everybody that 's ever bought a gun from a licensed dealer , so they know what serial number belongs to what name and what address . And this registration has never stopped straw purchases from taking place . Although if you stupid gun fearing liberals would stop pressing laws that would limit gun sales to one per month then maybe the ATF could use this registration system and locate potential straw purchasers through their bulk purchase records .
Exactly . Moreover , in Emerson the discussion of the 2nd Am . is dicta ( arguments not pertinent to the verdict ) so it is not a binding precedent even for the courts in the same Circuit . A question for the `` original intent '' crowd : What did the Founding Fathers intend with the misplaced comma in the 2nd Amendment ?
Forgive me if this seems picky , but I just want to try and fully understand this argument . I should say that I do n't necessarily agree with it , and would like to respond as to why . I just want to give a proper representation of your argument so that I can make a sound response . As such , you can no more force her , against her will , to provide bodily resources to an embryo or fetus , than you can yourself be forced to give of your bodily resources against your will ... . Where does this right originate from , i.e. , is it from the US Constitution via the 14th amendment etc ?
I think most people have the integrity to marry for love and no other reason .
But I did n't say it was based on proclamations ( arbitrary or otherwise ) ; you did -- at least one side 's . I said it was based on what 's behind the proclamation . I think you are getting hung up on the proclamation and not realizing that all the `` proclamation '' does is reflect the moral view behind it . It 's no different than your proclamation that morality be based on reason .
I figure that for freedom OF religion to continue , our freedom FROM religion must be guaranteed . How can our freedom OF religion be a sure thing , when other religions force themselves upon us throught the government and legal system ?
Because the whole point of disproving Adam is to eliminate the idea of personal sin . Yep , thats exactly why Ive always disliked the Adam and Eve tale . Never mind the colossus of contradictory evidenceits all about making sure that vile idea of personal sin goes up in smoke with the fable itself .
But it really does deal with thinking . It can invite a more wide open scientific investigation of ecological and developmental patterns . It 's not politically afraid to pursue facts about newly discovered complexities of life which pose problems for those trying to make a case for happenstance origins . It invites thought , not suppression , of irreducible complexity , another problem for happenstance origins .
We do n't actually know this for sure . There is some data but much speculation as to what is exactly causing larger and more frequent storms . The bigger problem of reducing salinity is the currents themselves and how they intergrate with migration and heat transfer . Sources of food that humans depend upon could disappear if currents drastically change . And the basis of Day after Tommorrow is correct in how the gulf stream helps regulate temperatures in Europe .
Oh , undoubtedly - but the offspring are n't inheriting traits as such are they ? They 're just suffering the same symptoms of malnutrition as their parents , except that for them it 's happening in vitro so they exhibit the effects from birth . That 's why it 's such a bad example for what you 're trying to get others to accept .
Well ... so far eight out of nine state supreme courts that have taken up the issue have found that barring same-sex marriage is unconstitutional . We 're waiting to hear about three or four more . As for the nature of marriage , it is both a legal contract and ( sometimes ) a religious ceremony ( sacrament in some religions ) . We 're stuck with the duality , whether we like it or not , and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect . Different religions can do what they want .
What a load .
Yes , I would stay out of it , unless I knew the woman , and she spoke up and asked me for an opinion , or advice . And even in the case of the woman being my best friend , and knowing all the different aspects to the situation , I still would not feel comfortable weighing in . Just like if it was me in the situation , I know that ultimately , it would be my decision , and I would have a right to that decision .
Ill be the first to agree with the saying `` If you can ... and have the place to ... you will '' But like anything else..you have to look at the better side of things ... It would act like a deterant to allow our responsable citizens to be armed..yes perhaps what you said might take place..but the benefits would outway them..and thats all we can ask for in life . As for our irresponsable citizens ... they are already armed .
Worship me and I 'll bless you too . With money of course . He ca n't even give you money . I am the true god and I created the mindset that he was a god in him . Worship me and spread the word about the true religion . Everyone who joins my church will instantly get $ 1,000 and after a week of membership you will get $ 1 million . The end of the week is when my project is and then you can go into the real world . All those who did n't believe in me will be destroyed when my world I created gets to the dump .
You mean ; let 's use a straw-man . But anyway ...
Thats right ! Let them burn and murder the people who work in abortion clinics . Its all for a good cause , so why not ? After all it has been done before and it worked as the murdered doctor never carried out anymore abortions .
Yes it was . The Noachian flood did not occur . Ignoring the obvious impossibilities of the ship/animals/etc , we see that the results a global flood would have caused do not exist .

Which would make that belief :
My article was about the banning of swords in Australia . Another step in the tyrranicle overstepping of power by a government over its people . Its called victim disarmament as the criminals that use guns , swords , cars , etc will still use these items to harm . Disarming the law abiding does nothing but flex the power of the fedgov sow .
And to think : We actually got nut jobs like this in government postions .
Actually , evolution , as used by biologists , is not the study of origins of life . It is the theory that explains how new species arise , and why the present species ( and past species in the fossil record ) have the characteristics that they do , not only in form but also in spatial and temporal extent .
Oh , so God 's design prowess is comparable to that of we mere humans ? He 's no more intelligent than us ? I thought God was supposed to be all knowing , but I guess you 've just shown that to not be the case . You also miss the fact that we KNOW FOR A FACT that internal combustion engines are designed by humans , and that we KNOW FOR A FACT that they could not arise without us . On the other hand , we do NOT KNOW that humans were designed by God and we do NOT KNOW that humans could not arise without Him . In fact , we have considerable evidence to the contrary : that humans evolved from a common ancestor we share with chimps . Engines do n't reproduce ; life does . Engines do n't undergo biological evolution ; life does . Your analogy is flawed , in multiple ways .
Homo Sapien has n't existed for millions of years . It would be more appropriate to say that the Earth has provided the basis for life for hundreds of millions of years .
The source I cite is a Japanese Admiral who survived WW2 , who took part in December 7 . Those were his exact words , `` We were not fools to step in quicksand '' . Meaning the officer was quite aware of civilian owned guns and yes they were afraid of grannies point shotguns out of kitchen windows . In China were there are no guns , the army was quite comfortable to rape and kill women and children at will . Iraq is handing the 82nd Airborne thier hinnie as we speak . The militia is not going to stand head to head on a battlefield . That is the job of the standing army , not the militia . The civilians and irregulars in Iraq are doing EXACTLY what the militia will do in the USA agains a forgein invader . If you have n't noticed more solidered have been killed from the irregualrs than on the battlefield . Sorry for the slow response I have been trying to prevent the homeless from freezing on the streets at night . I would not be going into the places where the homeless frequent at night if I did not have a gun . So there is one more reason why I carry a gun , to protect me while I save the homeless on the street .
Yeah , it normally is n't that a woman seeks out someone to abuse them but an abused woman is more likely to end up with someone that will abuse them as that is what they know and that an abusing can have qualities that make the abused feel comfortable . This is true for anyone though ... often you are attracted to certain things .
Keeping porn legal and accessible on the internet , keep taxes high , keep abortion legal ... .keep people voting democrat . Send as many people to hell as possible .
But there is no slippery slope . Lets see . The Brady Bill was passed November 30 , 1993 . Then just 3 months later S.1878 or Brady Bill 2 was introduced in the Senate , February 28 , 1994. and wanted all of this just 3 months later ! Some of the provisions of Brady 2
This is such a typical response on your part . Do n't actually respond to the post , simply deflect the attention to Kerry . Always `` yeah , but John Kerry ... '' rather than a response that actually considers the content of the post .
No . That 's the hypothesis . A theory has been tested . That means that from the hypothesis a prediction is made that has the power to falsify the hypothesis . In other words , the prediction must necessarily be true if the hypothesis is correct . Then an experiment is designed and conducted to test the prediction . When the hypothesis has been tested strongly , it is called a theory . From the evidence a hypothesis is formulated . The hypothesis is a proposed explanation that takes into account all of the observed facts . It is built on previous science , experience and sometimes guess work . Then comes the prediction , followed by the experiment that tests the prediction . If it passes , you may have a theory .
where did the muck come from ?
yeah , that is correct .
Here 's a picture of it http : //www.toyen.uio.no/palmus/galle ... re/161_632.jpg The specimens have been dated between 120 & amp ; 140 my . If at the upper end of that range that puts it very close to the age of Archaeopteryx ( 140 to 170 my ) . But contrary to what creationists like to claim , this is n't a problem . There is no claim that Archaeopteryx is ancestral to Confuciusornis . If you look at birds now you will see lots of different species . They have a common ancestor but are not descended from one another . Archaeopteryx is just the oldest example of a bird that we have , and considering the distance between the sites where the fossils were found , and possibly several million years in time , I would expect them to be different .
I think the Democrats are generally seen as the lesser of two evils . Your point about gay rights groups perhaps endorsing a Democrat out of blind party loyalty over a pro- gay marriage Republican is an interesting point . Perhaps the answer is for those in all parties who are gay , to be more aggressive in promoting their equality . A lot of work needs to be done in both the Democratic and Republican parties .
You ca n't ... only admin can ... and there 's no need to be sorry .
Like the above quote , why is the church trying to stop abortion when they would consider one to be alive after taking a breath . if you were to look at it from a scientific standpoint , the individual ovum and sperm are living cells , but they die all the time and no one cares . An embryo or fetus is something starting to develop into a human and that ca n't be stopped without killing it or injecting differnt DNA , but it 's still not too different from sperm and ovum . If you ca n't trust the church to make fair decisions and follow values and morals and rules they put in place , how can you expect an honest good decision about anything from it .
Personally , I do n't have a problem with a single thing you said . You made your CHOICE , and we in the Pro-Choice camp respect your right to choose . Now , just do n't go around trying to impose your choice ( which I personally think is perverted and sexist ) on the women in my family . You have the obligation to respect their choices just as we respect yours . BTW , please tell Gush Limpbutt that there is a world of difference between human , i.e , possessing the right genes , and personhood , which begins at birth .
I believe Jesus actually can be both . Jesus called himself `` the son of man '' , and we all fall into that category . Jesus calmed his father was in heaven . Jesus asked his mother , `` Who is my brother or my sister ? '' How can Jesus be the son of man and yet the son of God ? What prayer did Jesus give when asked ? Jesus told those who asked for a prayer from him to pray ; `` Our Father , who art in heaven . '' Hold up- If we pray , `` our father '' , then who are we ? We are the son of man . We are the son of God . Maybe getting to know yourself brings you closer to God than anyone else can . What does being born again mean ? All things born have a mother and a father . I believe love is logical . And Love is the simple key to understanding yourself and your neighbor . No other key will get you closer to self understanding . Now its logical to say a designer places a little of himself in everything he makes . If this is true then God is in us . Maybe love and a mirror is the best book you 'll ever read on the subject of God .

What does being a priest have to do with anything ? It would n't matter if he were a Satan worshipper .
Are you suggesting that if abortion were banned that abortion clinics that are already done will flood the US ? Please , get real here . People would probably go across the bordor and get abortions there ... you might have drugs from canada come over that cause abortion but there is no reason to believe this will `` clog '' up the jails . People need to realize that is was only 30yrs ago that abortion was pretty much illegal ( in most states ) . Did you see prisons flooded ? no .
And can you please tell me the difference between nonrandom variation and directed variation ? I 'd also like a link to verify what you say . Thank you . God Bless !
So , Gilligan , by the above criteria is a tapeworm considered part of an infested woman ? Or is it simply a genetically distinct parasite dependent upon another genetically distinct being for survival ?
Do n't think so . Provide an example of an `` unbridaled capitalist '' system operating in the 19th century .
Hmm , I wonder why Asian scientists and businesses are going so great guns into emryonic stem cell research ? Those folks in Asia seem to be lots smarter in business than we Americans -- as witnessed by the number of Asian-made cars and other products that are purchased all over the world .
Because what inspired my argument/debate challange was the Questions for both sides thread , it was full of vague/popular laymans usages of the term , and you cant blame only me for it , since I did n't start the thread , and since I was only about 1/10 of all the broad usages of the term going on in that thread , the rest were coming from evolutionists . Please read its opening post ( by an evolutionist )  youre not going to find much about biology there .
So Gup20 wants to play word games . ( Sigh ) This is usually a sign that he or she has run out of logical arguments . Anyway , this topic is in another thread . I wo n't discuss it here .
Stevens said that bear arms has a military meaning . So was he saying that the right is individual but existed in connection with militia service ? Is this some kind of hybrid model ? Interestingly , scholars who made similar claims in the past got lumped in with those who supported a collective right by the pro gun crowd . But I suppose it sounds good to say that all nine Supreme Court justices supported an individual rights interpretation .
And if the data supports both theories equally well ?
Yes more gun free zones that should be called helpless victim waiting areas . Strange how the gun control freaks wet dream idea of countries still have shooting deaths . Japan , UK two island nations with wet dream gun control still have them .
A ) we can use experiments to show evoution . We have observed it . For example , there is the lactose test , where some bacterial had the gene to digest lactose removed . After letting it grow into the billions , and then fed ONLY lactose , it can be shown that some individuals had a gene that could digest lactose , and survive . There is also anti-bodic resistant bacteria that evolved due to the use of antibodics .. evolution at work .
Only the Christians who do n't know what they 're talking about .
So says the master of cherry picking .
The atheist needs to explain how something can exist thats not material , can not be observed , and is absolute .
Sigma I have taken into account the options a woman has after pregnancy . However , there are no doubt cases in the history of the world ( not just within America ) where there were no options available to a mother but to keep her child ( ie : the first human woman to give birth in the history of the world ) . For this pro-choice line of reasoning to be absoulutely true it must be true in every possible situation . Are you saying that the killing would be justified if no other options were available to her ?

To answer your question , yes I would support abstinence to protect anyone 's health , not just women 's . Risks of STIs including AIDS and unwanted pregnancy are obvious examples that can be largely avoided by not having sex . Cervical cancer is triggered by a virus that a woman is exposed to through sex . Even if she does not contract any STD , there is a high correlation between rates of cervical cancer , HPV ( human papolloma virus ) , and having intercource . Cervical cancer almost never occurs in virgins , and there is a high rate of occurrence in women who have had multiple sex partners . Abstinent women also have lower rates of urinary tract infections and vaginitis . Those can be caused by skin being dragged into the vagina inadvertently during intercourse , and the penis has bacteria on it just like all skin . Teenage girls also would obviously have higher levels of academic achievement if they are abstinent . Less depression and emotional turmoil due to relationship problems if they are abstinent , as well as less domestic or partner abuse . However , I do n't believe that advocating abstinence only is a smart way of approaching a problem . Obviously very few people are abstinent all of their lives ; intercourse is a normal part of a healthy lifestyle . Preaching abstinence-until-marriage is also an unreachable goal and means nothing to same-sex couples . Furthermore , there is little scientific evidence that shows that abstinence only education works . Research demonstrates that comprehensive sex education , including abstinence and contraception , is the most effective , according to well-respected groups including the American Medical Association , the American Academy of Pediatrics , the Society for Adolescent Medicine , the Institute of Medicine , the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association . All of these groups reject abstinence only programs in favor of comprehensive sex education . The Institute of Medicine recommends `` Congress , as well as other federal , state and local policymakers , eliminate the requirements that public funds be used for abstinence-only education and that states and local school districts implement and continue to support age-appropriate comprehensive sex education . '' ( No Time to Lose : Getting More from HIV Prevention , Institute of Medicine )
I know of a similar argument that could be misinterpreted : Evolution producing what exists today could have gone any one of millions of ways . However , it is n't much surprise that what we have came out of it , just like it would n't be a surprise for a random number generator to come up with 475475.339 : something had to come out , and something did . Chances are , you are referring to that argument .
Absolutely right . I 'd like to put another ticker mark on the Creationists ' side . What about the woodpecker argument ? Has anyone mentioned that yet ?
Actually , `` entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity '' was his statement . `` Most likely '' applies . `` Do not '' is inaccurate .
How much do you know about it ? You babbled something about `` ... our failure to reason according to evidence and facts , ... '' Did you ? What evidence did you look at for or against evolutionary theory ? What facts did you consider ? Did you , for example , examine thousands of trilobite fossils ? Perhaps you climbed into the Canadian Rockies to look at the fossils in the Burgess shale , none of which represent animals that are living today . Maybe you spent a year or two in the Galapagos with the Grants . So please , tell us how you did not fail to reason according to evidence and facts . But then you continued , `` ... as well as to seek out the constant and unchanging truth contained in God 's Holy Word . '' That has nothing to do with either reasoning or facts . How is that related in any way to evolutionary theory ? Why do you think one must choose one or the other ?
Because the common defintions of God include such characteristics as sentience , omnipotence , omniscience , etc , none of which would apply to a multiverse . All you 're trying to do here is say that God exists by changing the defintion of God . That 's cheating .
Do you know what conclusions the person drew from this ? What conclusions do you draw from this ? That people that own guns are less scared ? Or just nicer people ?
Besides , evolution has relatively few holes . A fair percent of it has actually been proven in the natural and artifical worlds .
I think it 's a bit of a stretch to say that the pro-life argument relies exclusively on religious doctrine . I 'm a Conservative and religious , but I think that abortion can be discussed without bringing religion into it . My personal opinion is it 's a mistake for Pro-lifers to bring religion into it because it fuels the hatred of the God-less Left LMAO
I dont know if you actually read his/her entire post but God was invoked into it . So why cant I use any reference to God if they are using it ?
I 'll ask the question that needs to be asked . If France qualifies as a `` developed nation '' as we 've been lead to believe , why did the homeowner have to resort to getting close enough that he could strangle the burglar ? Surely if you 're a developed nation , you 're not going to force your own people to put themselves in harms way while they 're in the process of saving themselves , right ?
No need .
The same bogus argument wrapped up in a new package . GAY MARRIAGE DESTROYS MARRIAGE ! ! DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU cAN STILL MARRY WHOMEVER YOU WANT . DUHHHHHHHHHH rocket sience here .
Yours is the voice of a bitter gay person talking , who has only seen one side of things ( probably hardship ) . But there are many good examples of the population being informed and doing things right . In fact I think typcially , the populace DOES take care of people -- I think Americans are generally pretty humanitarian people . That 's my opinion . I think the reason there has been resistance to redefine marriage is that people really know that this is not a civil rights issue , despite attempts by the gay lobby to paint it that way . I will say this though : gay people need to be treated as well as anyone else in this country and acts of violence should not be permitted . We should all be able to get along . But that does n't mean we should have to redefine marriage to do it . As I said , states have the ability to amend their constitution to protect the institution of marriage from redefinition , and 13 states have already done so -- many others are working on it . You should probably get used to it . Marriage is just too important to too many people to be redefined so easily .
I 'm not claiming any omnipotent deciever . I 'm not sure where you derive 'probability ' from , or how you can have any degree of certainty over your past experiences or those of other consciousnesses . And in any case , saying 'it has n't happened yet ' is hardly logical proof .
Oh , I suspect my kid likes girls well enough , but most of them are n't any good at football so he finds them relatively useless ( unless they are good at video games ) . Lots of kids were losing it early when i was young , too . I remember it being peer pressure thing , an attampt to be cool . And I also remember sex ed being pretty sad ... .
And with the possible exception of collecting , Australian licensing laws allow all of the above . I should know I have lived and shot over there . The idea of such laws is to remove weapons from those who have no good reason to own such things , and put extra safety restrictions on those who do . For the record , I do not actually agree with such stringent measures myself . But I do n't think your argument really holds water . And to make such associations with tyranny is exagerated to say the least .
The argument is that it is unreasonable to expect a mother to have the obligation to share her body with anyone , whether a stranger/stranger , mother/child , sister/brother , father/son , friend/friend , person/acquaintance or any combination of these .
Well , as the Christain Zealots say , `` Eve ate the apple '' .
Bush has flip flopped just as much as Kerry . As for records , there is next to nothing showing that Bush actually showed up and did anything for the Guard .
No , that is far too narrow-minded . However , I suppose that a fundamental Christian looking out from their beliefs would probably agree . Other believers might think that we do not know everything and others may have some understanding of areas where we do not
No , that was not an argument . It was an illustration of a point . The point was this : that in order to stand in moral judgment of God , you would have to be of higher moral character than God . In other words , you would have to be God in order to judge God . Now , the point I made is that this is highly unlikely , as any being claiming to be God would not misspell words , no matter how closely the letters are on the keyboard . To be clear , I was not attacking you ( at least I did n't intend to ) by calling out your spelling mistake . I was trying to illustrate a point . And the point was this : you are not perfect , and therefore , you are not God . And if you are not God , then you really can not stand in moral judgment of God .
But can you actually take one away ? Can you provide stronger evidence than the confirming evidence that has already been gathered ?
You have done a marvelous job knocking down strawmen of your own construction . Having offered a naive and superficial caricature of atheism , agnosticism , and theism , you then imagine a self-serving hierarchy that is , in a word , worthless - all in a silly effort to show yourself most humble . Ironic .
Mythic nonsense ? It 's historical fact . Or are you one of those `` The Holocaust never took place '' people ?

Far from showing any modern knowledge of blood circulation , this shows : 1 ) if you take the blood out of an animal it will die . A simple fact all civilizations of the time would have known . 2 ) God like for his followers kill living things . He is the God of blood .
And many news stories have referred to the New York shooter as being armed with a `` high powered rifle '' despite the fact that this was blatantly false . Why should we take this story as being fully factual about the details of background checks and gun shows ? And a lot of newspapers are repeating the claims that fully-automatic machine guns , anti-tank missiles , fragmentation grenades and rocket launchers , are being bought by mexican drug cartel members -even though they could n't possibly pass a background check- and that they 're being bought from gun stores in America ! But no matter how many times we demand proof of such , NONE IS EVER PRESENTED ! Come back with undeniable proof that FFL dealers never conduct federally mandated background checks when selling guns at gun shows , otherwise do n't post on the topic anymore since you have nothing but lies and scare mongering tactics .
There is no need for prey animals to grow a third or forth eye as a defense mechanism . Binocular vision works . Its balanced and can render 3d positioning in the mind accurately . The lizard that you mentioned is born with a spot sensitive to light which helps the body absorb vitamin d , as humans do due to skin that is light-sensitive to a certain extent . It is n't an eye for defending against predators , and it does n't need one . As for insects , the fact that they 've survived for such a long time goes to show that they have adapted adequately and are doing well . Have you tried sneaking up on a fly lately ?
What makes you think I am using them as a source ? I would suggest you read the story you read about again . It is Nathanson , not people , who makes the claim . However saying someone lied and proving that they did are two entirely different things . Nathanson said they lied he hasnt proved it as such . Secondly , the figures you speak of that were supposedly based on lies is only exclusive to after the 1950s . We are talking about the 1930s . Lastly , using figures after the 1940s is highly skewed ; therapeutic abortion was pretty much Roe v Wade lite and eliminated the use of criminal abortion in the middle and upper classes . Now , lets get to the facts . Our overall abortion rate was 22.9 in 1996 according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute . In 1930 , Hamiliton published the rate of abortion in 1930 in specific social and economic groups in , Some Sociologic and Psychologic Observations on Abortion. The abortion rate in those of the upper/middle class was 24.3 , for poor unmarried white women it was 64 % and for minorities the abortion rate was 40 % . So women were aborting probably about a third of their pregnancies in the 1930s . Stixs , A Study of Pregnancy Wastage puts the abortion rate at 35 percent or 35 abortions per 100 live births .
Really . Please cite where Darwin discussed `` Macro Evolution . '' What paper or book , and what chapter ? What did he say about it that is hilarious . Have you actually read Darwin ? Perhaps his paper on earth worms ? Or maybe his paper on the formation of coral islands ? I have n't read either of those or most of his other works . But I happen to have a copy of On The Origin Of Species and I ca n't find any discussion of `` Macro Evolution '' . I even have an electronic version of Origin and a search of the text gives zero hits on `` Macro Evolution '' or `` macroevolution '' or even `` macro-evolution . '' In fact , there are zero hits on `` evolution . ''
Defense of Marriage Act - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia This very discussion could very well lead to the recognition that the federal DOMA itself is unconstitutional . And as for the state DOMA , this discussion is EXPLICITLY saying that it violates the federal constitution .
Actually , SkepticGunt expressed the opinion that the speed of light is the greatest anti-creationist argument . You are being a bit redundant in repeating that . What exactly is it that SkipticGunt should be learning from a creationist ? One certainly ca n't learn any science from creationist assertions that the speed of light must have changed . I guess one can learn some really bad science from `` creation scientists . '' Of course , the debate was settled a couple hundred years ago when creationism was falsified . But there are still some creationists who cling to primitive ideas , just like there are flat earthers and geocentrists .
I 'm always interested in arguments where 'image ' assumes physical likeness . When God said , 'Let us make man in our image and likeness ... ' , I wonder why God needs five fingers , two eyes , a heart , liver etc . He 's supposed to be a spirit and therefore has no need of physical characterisitics . Easily understood when man created his own god . But what if 'image ' refers to character and personality , not physical appearance ? Man really is like his god in that case : murderous , jealous , petty , genocidal , caring , loving , contrary et al . Like father , like son . Character-wise , man has probably always been the same to some extent or other .
Well , it worked . I was hoping the debate could be raised above spouting platitudes and you stepped up and met the challenge with maturity and and openness .

Actually , one . After the adoptions years ago , we hit the financial slump and had a suprise ... The costs will extremely low . I 've also been in discussion with numerous friends who 've delivered , same story . Somehow , no matter how there is no money and no help , babies get born . And as I 've said , there are plenty of organizations that will cover all costs finacially in cases of adoption .
Really ? Then why have n't you condemned organizations such as the Brady Campaign ? They continually put out the lie that the .50 BMG is capable of bringing down commercial planes as if the entire process was mere child 's play , but there 's absolutely not a shred of evidence to support this claim .
Just because it is n't verbally found in the Constitution does n't mean I feel that it is constitutionally irrelevant . I feel that it is . Here is my question to you ... do you understand why abortion is constitutional ?
Another twist ? I bet you want two Snickers bars now , huh ?
You could also be aborting a future Hitler , Castro , Stalin , or Mao ? What if they were the next Timothy McVeigh . As you can see , this argument is fallacious and can be used for either side of the issue .
Million year old moths did n't have the same capabilities as a present day moths . Million year old moths had capabilities that suited it to the million year old environment . Changes to moths have been subtle because it is a successful group of organisms , but changes do exist . Also , you keep harking on brains making creatures adaptive . An ant has a brain , yet an ant follows a very predictable program that can be quite easily simulated by computers . Of course there is always a randomizaion factor , but you must n't confuse random action with adaptation .

This is only one of several examples of quite rapid evolution that has been observed by the Grants on Daphne Major over what must now be about 30 years . Here 's the situation . Essentially , there are two food sources from two different plants for the finches on Daphne Major . One is a small seed - easily cracked . The other is a large hard shelled seed . At one time , during a drought , the Grants observed that some native finches , Geospiza fortis , evolved larger beaks that enabled them to eat the larger , hard shelled seeds . In other words , the bell curve was extended at the large bill size end . The article ( and I presume the paper published by the Grants ) recounts the colonization of Daphne Major by a larger ground finch , G. magnirostris , with a correspondingly larger bill . The point is that large G. fortis and small G. magnirostris are similar in size , having similar beak size . As a result , they directly competed for scarce resources . As a result , large beaked G. fortis and small beaked G. magnirostris were at a reproductive disadvantage . As a result , the smaller beaked G. fortis evolved to specialize in the smaller , more easily cracked seeds that G. magnirostris had difficulty in picking up , while G. magnirostris evolved to specialize in the larger , hard shelled seeds . Anyone interested should read Weiner , Jonathan . The Beak Of The Finch . 1994 . Vantage Books , New York . It won a Pulitzer Prize and is the story of the Grants ' research on Daphne Major .
Its always interesting to see atheists making profound statements about billions of years , and mocking the Bible as being very , very old . Okay , enough about that  Im now going to condense the various atheist explanations that have been presented to me at 4forums over the years . Is the following a parody , or is it the real thing ?
This argument is self-defeating . A theory is not a fact , no matter how much evidence may support the theory . Bad wording . But again , if you claim something as a fact , you must have proof , verified in both your method of reasoning , and the reasoning utilized by the person you are proving the fact to .
We know this because the kids destroyed all the interactive exhibits within a day when the Earth Gallery opened . I for one was most upset as I 'd been wanting to have a play too
In other words , you 're discussing when government should use violence . Which according to you , is a lot of the time . Especially should someone dare to defend themselves against a home invader . You really do n't see the hypocrisy in condemning someone for violence and simultaneously calling for more violence , do you ?
Would depend on how sucessful they thought the handing in was , but do n't you have to register for a leicence ? So all legal owners are know already and can be checked off against the guns they have handed in , I would imagine that there must be departments of the police who deal with tracking black market unregisted guns so these could be cracked down opon . In addition you would have to make possesion of a firearm illegal , then you have to balance defending your property with revealing you are commiting a crime ( will be fairly obvious if you use one and you would have to get rid of it anyway when forensics investigate the crime scene ) . Would also have to look at countries that have carried out sucessful ones to see if there are any little points or mistakes to pick up . If there is a lot of resistance you could make possesion of a gun attempted murder , would make people think very carefully whether they would want to carry them , especailly criminals- comunity service or light sentace for a mugging or long term prison sentance for attempted murder if they are carrying a gun while doing it , even in bank robbery they would likely think twice about the additional years .
Bullsh^t . Permit holders are hundreds of times less likely to commit crimes than YOU , statistically speaking .
Talk about a crock ! How can you wail on anyone with your imaginary truth stick of no mercy when you would n't know the truth if you tripped over it ? And you going ballistic like this just proves the exact point I made in that you 'll allow my free speech until I say something you disagree with and then you attack me to shut me up . Which is exactly what I said above that precipitated your childish tirade . See ?
The idea that the earth was flat was an `` accepted '' principle as well . There is no verse that I know of that ever claims man has `` free will '' . In fact , the Bible actually says that before you can even choose to follow God he must first choose you .
Actually , since most Americans opposed this healthcare take over it would seem they are more concerned with being shanghied by government . The lawyers are the only ones that will benefit from this passing . There will be multiple injunctions imposed on this legislation by the middle of April . This legislation will never be enforced , it ca n't pass a judicial sniff test . By the end of 2012 A large portion of the legislators that voted for this will be voted out of office , including the President that signed it . It will then be repealed and the lawyer will have to find another cash cow .
So you get fined for not voting , i said you get fined for not voting yet i am talking out the back of my arse . How did you figure that ? I provided accurate information and get abused by a gun hater , i can live with that as gun haters are well known for hating facts NATO I could not agree with you more !
See , this is the same logic used by the slaver owners . If one believes slavery is wrong then what right does he have to impose that on someone else ?
Nope . Life began at some moment of abiogenesis , billions of years ago . Sperm and ova are both alive . They do not suddenly become alive after being dead because they meet .
Oh ? Seeing as my information comes from active Canadian Forces members , both gay and straight , I 'd say that I 'd know about it . Anecdotal evidence , to be sure , but it seems to be supported by the official channels .
This from a Sumo Spainiard barricaded in a basement ? You got so many things wrong here it would take a book to cover them all and you ca n't read . tsk , tsk , tsk
There are flood stories carried by many cultures , however they do n't match in the details with noah flood myth . Not one mentions noah by name .
Not between nonrandom variation and directed variation : between nonrandom amounts of variation , and directed variation . For instance , if I heat up a kettle of water , the motion of the liquid becomes more violent . The amount of motion is non-random , linked as it is to the temperature of the water , but the motion itself is random . Is that satisfactory ? Taking things a step further , we can also observe that the motion of the water , while random , is nevertheless constrained by the kettle . This is analogous to the 'developmental constraints ' mentioned in the article you quote . I confess to seeing nothing problematic for the ToE in the idea that natural selection would favour genomes that are less susceptible to some mutations than to others .
Because evolution is how God created . Sorry , but we ca n't lie to our kids . We ca n't tell them creationism is true when God tells us it is false .
So you agree that we should leave weather out of it and focus on healt care cost ? All the developed countries ( all of Europe , Canada , Japan , Australia , New Zealand , Taiwan , Israel ) have universal healthcare . Their COST per capita is about half of ours . They have better outcomes i.e . longer life expectancy , fewer preventable deaths , lower infant mortality , in most cases more doctors per capita . They have lower cost in spite of the fact that the U.S. insurance companies insure only the healthy . Over there they treat the sick . What are the insuranc ecompanies doing with our money ? ? How come the small businesses , the self-emplyed are priced out of the market and left to die in pain ? ?
O they do n't make space anymore . They 'll just put him in a cell with pot growers and crack addicts . He 'll be lucky if he gets a spot on the floor to sleep on .
That is an erroneous line of reasoning because it fails to take into account the myriad of other options open to a women after birth to remove the newborn from her care without any ill effects ( physically anyway ) . Killing in the instance of a newborn is not justified because of those other options open to her . By contrast , a pregnant woman has exactly one option open to her to remove the fetus from her care and that is abortion . I would contend that the same line of reasoning that allows for adoption can be used here , that no one must donate their resources to a dependant . Your reasoning that a woman , using the same line of reasoning that pro-choice people employ , can withhold her bodily resources `` until the newborn dies '' as if that is equal to withholding bodily resources in pregnancy is faulty .
Take somes cells from one of you fingers and put it under a microscope .
No one wants to take your `` marriage '' away Matt . It 's a free country -- no one 's going to block your way to any chapel that will marry you . Do your gay thing . But let marriage be marriage -- it 's a different matter . People just want to keep you from tampering with the institution of marriage .
I will agree science has disproven the literal reading of a number of different scriptures , such as the literal reading of Genesis ( which was never meant to be literal to begin with , but that is a different matter ) . It also might explain why spiritiual beliefs exist for people . However , when it comes to this vaguly defined entity that alledgely created the universe , science has nothing to say about the existance of this alledged supernatural being .
And after 40 years of the war on drugs and drug control , just how close are we to that ? You must remove the demand for illegal drugs because as long as there is a demand there will be someone there to smuggle it , make it , or grow it and supply it .
Have you ever had an abortion ?
So if I go out and buy a Brand X car and then regret it a year later , does that mean that nobody should be allowed to go out and buy a Brand X car ? Am I entitled to have an opinion and share it with others ... sure . However , could others purchase a Brand X car and never regret it ... absolutely . Should my negative experience be used to prevent others from engaging in something that they might consider positive ? Sounds kinda fascist to me .

secularism is a religion based upon faith and I was speaking to simone . what is your religion ?
Meh . Foundit66 is moderator on a different site . Nobody cares . It 's a rare case that a board could ever find a truly centrist person to moderate . If you have a problem with JP as a mod on this forum , no one 's making you participate . I do n't post on the forum Foundit mods , myself . If it 's really that big a deal to you that JP mods a forum catagory on this site , then put your money where your mouth is and do n't let the door hit you where the good Lord split you , on the way out .
Actually you support `` my choice '' not . - For you see , your choice of the word BUT negates your words preceding it , for one . For two , your own lack-of-understanding is causing you to feel `` disgust me , because I 'm pretty sure '' < -- what you said here , confirms the above . And Telling & amp ; transparent is : `` So you saying `` God '' is against abortion , is the same as me saying `` God '' wants me to kill non-believers and adulterers . '' Annie : only by your twisted arguments . Your entire post here , is built on one false manipulation after another . And after you managed to get yourself into this fix , no wonder the above non-sense is the best you can come up with .
Well , 'convenience ' is a debatable word here - its convenient for you to let a great number of people in Africa die because you want a TV , or electricity or a holiday , whilst its far less convenient for someone to have to carry a child . They will actually phsyically suffer whilst you just do n't get the latest in modern western luxuries . Abortion as a means of birth control is just not a good idea though .
Police are probably much more aggressive than the average citizen , but most of the time their aggression is channeled against the bad guys . And do n't you find it significant that a gun , a symbol and tool of violence , can raise levels of testosterone ? What kind of effect does testosterone have on behavior ? Dogs become more friendly when testosterone is reduced in their bodies through neutering : `` One of the most important behavioral advantages of castration is that as adults , these dogs will tend to be less aggressive both toward other male dogs and also people . The androgen ( male ) hormones , of which testosterone is the most important , are responsible for the development of many behavioral patterns . When young puppies are sexually mounting their 7 and 8-week old litter mates this is because of androgen surges in their bodies . The same is true with aggressive behavior . '' Benefits of Neutering ( Castrating ) Male Dogs & amp ; Puppies
Unfortunately for this argument , nature denies this a lot of the time . Most conceptions spontaneously abort .
And yet , here his drawings are used , as plain as day in a 2002 text book to teach evolution . You can choose to just ignore evidence you do n't like lesz , but that does n't make it go away . Evolution News & amp ; Views : The Textbooks Don ? t Lie : Haeckel ? s Faked Drawings Have Been Used to Promote Evolution : Raven & amp ; Johnson ( 2002 ) ( Part 2 ) When will you people learn that since Talk Origins exists to defend the fraudulent pseudo science of evolution , it stands to reason that all it does is perpetuate lies and misinformation !
Ianb , do n't confuse jyoshu with solid facts .
Oh so EVERYTHING except creation works without His help , I get it God makes everything . So God made our minds , and God made the scientific ideas that come into our minds , so God helped us understand all the things we do about science . But oh I guess that evil evolution one is the one scientific thought that came from Satan ... obviously ! ! ! Sarah
I see nothing regretable about it at all . Just as I see no reason to *****-foot around the issue as you choose to . In an ideal world , no one should be under the obligation to have to argue against YEC , as it is known beyond all sensible and reasonable doubt to be false . `` YEC theory '' has been falsified . It is a dead theory . It ought be be consigned to the rubbish pile along with other `` flat-earth '' ideas and ignored . Sadly though with the creation of the internet , people who spout nonsense and fallacy from a position of `` intellectual dishonesty '' ( they are more accurately called liars BTW ) or ignorance have been given a disproportionate voice . It has become necessary to argue against YEC . The best way to do this though is not to endlessly defend evolution from the scientifically illiterate stupid-brigade , but to go on the attack . YEC is weak and easily kicked down for it has no evidence to support it . Abandon your unnecessary civalry toward YEC supporters and give 'em a good - metaphorically speaking only please - kicking .
What a load of horse-hockey . Only those that are arrogant enough to believe they have a monopoly on the truth believe that . Evolution in no way excludes God . And I don & # 8217 ; t see where Christianity excludes God . I know lots of Christians that believe in evolution . What are you going to do , call them liars because they don & # 8217 ; t believe like you do ? You want to talk about being insulting and you turn right around and do the exact same thing .
As a Christian who accepts evolution as fact , I think it is great that Kansas has gone back to teaching actual science instead of religious delusions of the IDers . And the claim of evolution being `` just a theory '' shows how much you know about science . Gravity is just a theory , do you accept that ? There is Nuclear theory , do you claim the atomic bombs never went off in Japan ?
Yes but the proposal was for a formal type debate judged by a third party . Here we are just discussing the debate so far . Welcome to the forum .
The man seemed have a thing about prostitutes . I believe he felt it was his God-given destiny to punish them . Cybererratus is a very interesting persona . He manifests a number of very interesting character traits . I do n't believe that he likes women very much . In fact , I am rather concerned about how Cybererratus feels about women . Andrea Yates was certifiably insane and her killing of her children had nothing to do with post partum depression . And , she is being punished . She is serving life in prison -- as is Mr. Ridgway . I also find the comparisons that Cybererratus makes to be morally troubling .
Yes they do . Modern Coelocanth : Modern Coelocanth

As a child I took the existence of God as a given . For the life of me I ca n't understand how so many believers discount the life experience of non-believers . I never set out to abandon God . I simply can not believe based on what I have learned in my life . I suspect my story is not unique . I have seen the same `` evidence '' and have heard the same arguments my whole life . I am not `` in league '' with you know who nor am I deluding myself just to prop up science for its own sake . I wanted something to believe in that did not require me to deny that which is before my eyes and that which could be logically explained and/or observed . The fact of evolution is a conclusion based on scientific study and fits the evidence . As far as your scriptural quotes , as I have said , you are reading in science when only prose exists . The fact of creation is a conclusion based on mythology and faith .
OH MY GOD ! ! ! I JUST REALIZED ... I 'M TO BLAME ! My letter to the editor was printed in Sunday 's newspaper and Sunday night the storms started hitting the south ! That can not be coincidence . God has lifted his protecting hand because of my letter . But seriously , 3 people I ran into today told me they saw it . Two were people at work : one just said she read it without saying how she felt about it , the other went a bit farther to say that it really did n't offend her . But if you think about it , just her comment indicates that she felt that the way most people would respond would be negatively . The other person was my dentist , who I just happened to have an appointment with today . He starting talking at great length about Hugh Ross , and Gerald Shroeder , and how his own personal faith in Jesus and science get along just fine . I listened for about 15 minutes , only saying a few things now and then . And when I did , I did n't argue against his position ... I just pointed out that people really have to accept that evolution is true and that the Earth is billions of years old , which he had already said he accepted .
Well what about it girl ? That is due process !
Yes , there ARE good scientists on both sides of the issue -- you 've been shown this before already in another thread , as I recall .
You asked for one . I supplied it . If you 'd like to present an example of a show being explicitely atheist , please do so .
I know what you mean . I also wonder how they think their children or grandchildren will be paying for their medical bills . Note , by way of comparison , this Pittsburgh local t.v . clip of the September 20th March for Jobs ( part of Healthcare Justice Week , this week ) . See how clearly and intelligently the protesters articulate their objectives , and without the disgraceful display of blind malice we have otherwise witnessed from the teabaggers : http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=MkUxvX5JNJg
This is false . http : //www.talkorigins.org/faqs/polystrate/trees.html
Oh , I see now , you must pervert and completely redefine what animism is in order to apply it to your corruption of what christianity is according to the bible . I have accurately defined what animism is above in comparison to the Old and New Testament which it has nothing in common with . But in usual fashion you will claim it is me who does n't understand when it is you who must corrupt the truth with the lies and distortions you tell . BTW , your explanation above which I have posted in its entirety is nothing more than self indulgent gibberish . http : //www.religion-cults.com/Ancien ... sm/Animism.htm Do IDers actually want Intelligent Design taught in schools ?
So I am correct about my asserations as to your education ? Still you completely fail to argue the merits of creationism without attacking evolution which would conclude as we have all thought previously that creationism can not be defended or supported on its own merits
My , how revealing .
Not a federal government power as dictated in the constitution . The federal government has no business funding NPOs ( the obvious exception of services performed for the federal government is ok but this is more a payment ) .
Did n't I just say it is dumb to compare the two ?
Register for a license ? ? ? ? What do you meen ? I have quite a few firearms and have never registered for a license for any of them .
Look again .
What about the similarities between the museum and a church ?
Walking-fish : Well , it 's a darn good thing that they let that Tyrannosaur drown in the flood . If that thing ever got loose on the ark there would n't have been any animals or people left to repopulate the earth . It 's a darn good thing , I say .
Well , then . They 're not TROO christians . Just ask a certain poster on this board . When I told this certain poster that I have known several clergymen from several Christian denominations who accepted evolutionary theory , that 's what he told me . That certain poster and others would rather claim Newton , who was an arian , as a christian rather than clergymen who accept the divinity of Christ . Those clergy just understand both science and religion better .
And that is why Bible thumpers are so dangerous . The have so little self respect and so little respect for others that they need the thread of eternal punishment to keep them in check . Thank God for the Bible to frighten you into honorable behavior .
We are n't defending guns . We 're defending the right to be armed .
Well , the areas which might want these technologies do n't really have research facilities on every block .
Actually , there is . Well over 200 trans-Neptunian objects have been directly imaged by various means . All but Pluto have been found since 1992 , and way over half have been found since 1998 . I notice that of your references , one was published early in the year that the first ( third if you count Pluto and Charon ) was discovered , another was published two years later , and the third was published in 1974 ( ! ) . MY GOD ! ! 1974 ! I also notice that none of them have anything to do with comet origin .
Why is the bear angry ?
She seems neither to be one , nor the other .
And Sotomayor argued that the American people have absolutely no right to defend themselves . What 's your point ?
Yes . If this feeder is full , it lasts about a day and 1/2 . I 've gone through about 6 qts of hummingbird food since Aug 10 .
How do we get a tree to stand upright long enough for it to petrify , and how do we get upright petrified trees in layers of strata . There is evidence all over the world that stands up for biblical events , all you need to do is open yourself up and have a look.. I urge you guys to get a hold of the movie `` The search for the real Mt Sianai '' . This movie is rivetted with evidence for the Moses account in the bible . Any person with there head screwed on right will not be able to deny it !
And evolution is exhausted . It cant do anything with origins , and recent discoveries of the complexities of the simplest forms of life exhaust it even more .
Oh so I take it the drug dealer was a law abiding citizen who had obtained his firearm legally and used the shotgun in self defence ? I though not . Just out of personal interest lets say you took away the rights of the law abiding to own guns how would that shooting be stopped , cus i am pretty sure the drug dealing criminal would still get his gun Illegally . A gunner you say went on a massacre ? I am pretty sure you mean a criminal went on a massacre and maybe if somebody like Doc or Old sarge was there the end death tally would have been alot different .
Like evolution , right ? You have your conclusion , so everything else must adhere to it . Just answer the question . How to you account for the statements above ?
So if it 's not human , we can kill it ? But I dare say that 's a different topic completely . Sorry , that was more along animal rights than abortion . Abortion is this for me : If the baby is going to endanger the mother 's life as well as the baby , why endanger the baby and the mother ? Sticking on the decided path , would you rather kill something you know is human , or something that you 're not sure is human . It sounds a bit cruel and I did n't intend it to be that way at all . It 's just that one loss would hard enough , why make it two ?
Only in this country ? You ( purposely , no doubt ) overlooked the issue of whether they are `` people . '' Hell , by menstruating , women murder every month according to your logic .
It 's not responsibility when you 're allowing the school to punish a legal activity that happens well beyond the boundary of the physical school . Your position of argument , if applied to you , would earn you fines every time you decided to smoke a cigarette , even in your own home , if the place you worked had a no smoking policy .
That is true but that is the procedure ... ... ... Do you deny it ?
So you carry grenades and 75 pounds of gear , all while wearing camouflage fatigues and can call in an airstrike bombing ?
Good , you can address the claims made here , too . ETA : Also see how the movie 's version lines up with the information here regarding Sternberg .
And yet that is not the case . There are those who believe , on moral grounds , that what Hitler did was the right thing to do . An absolute morality requires absolute consensus , and there is n't any .
Not sure how you can tell that since very little is mentioned about his methods .
Probably like I already did in my thread-starting post : - )
Obviously . Somebody who is planning to shoot up a schoolyard , or murder their neiborgh , is obviously NOT going to be willing to face the penalty for breaking the seal on an ammo can . You have to wonder , though , why they even bother sealing the can , since swiss military ammo is so cheap . I suppose it it so , in the event that somebody ever is killed with a GI weapon , they can say `` It was n't government ammo that they were shot with '' . With some degree of certainty .
And then we point to Israel , where armed teachers have been responsible for a considerable drop in school shootings .
If you believe that it is the development of thinking ability that makes a human count as a life with rights , it seems reasonable to think that people with superior thinking ability would have superior rights .
Of course not , but I fail to see how atheists are using science as its god , can you please explain that to me directly ? Evolution does n't refute god at all . In fact with evolution , intelligent design is entirely possible . But that still does n't make it science .
So , I assume that you bought all of the liberal demogoguery about the big health insurance companies making obscence profits on the backs of dying people ? Here 's a little factual info for you . There was a recent ranking on the profitability of a wide variety of Industry types . I believe it was done by Forbes . The health care insurance companies ranked 35th in profitability with an ROI of 2.2 % . To put that in perspective , if the companies fired all of their employees and converted all of their assets to cash , they 'd have made more money putting in in a bank and drawing interest .
They are merely taking chemicals that they can detect in outer space and reproducing the enviroment they are found in , by exposing them to ultraviolet . You are exposed to ultraviolet when you walk outside in the sunshine . Every chemical that they used is readily detected in interstellar molecular clouds .
Well . . . one could make that argument about anything -- voting for instance . Amendments are created by voting , and people and legislatures vote ( hopefully ) their conscience ( and the will of their constituents ) , even if they are religious . I think this is a different matter than , say , displaying religious icons on courtroom walls or grounds , which is a clear endorsement of religion by the government . The 18th amendment was religion-motivated , but it did n't get rescinded for THAT reason . It got rescinded because it did n't work practically . ( and because FDR wanted to see the returns on the economy for his New Deal )
Sure . Bring on the free machineguns to every male of military service and the paper tape . BTW are YOU going to clean your machinegun ? You are going to have to own a machinegun in your home you know . Your going to be forced to keep your machinegun clean . Your going to be forced to learn to place head shots at 300 yards . Your going to be forced to keep ammo sealed by paper tape . Sure I do all that right now . I 'd be happy to do that with a free machinegun and free ammo . Is that what YOU want ? The government handing out free machineguns ? Just checking if you want that . I want it . Give me a free machinegun . Give my friends who shoot at the range and shoot rifle matches , give them all free machineguns and free ammo . Bring it on .
Well , you 've told me you do not believe , literally , in the book of genesis . God did n't create the world in six days , the earth and the rest of the universe are actually billions of years old , etc . But I assume you do believe , literally , in the ten commandments ? That they are really the words of god ? Why the dichotomy ? How can you write the creation story of as something to interpret as you wish , but the ten commandments are solid and correct ?
There are some very rare cases where abortion is legitimately allowable by society . However , most abortions do not fall under this catagory .
Not to rain on anyone 's parade : `` The liberal hysteria about the tea parties and town hall protests , kicked off by the Obama administrations issuance of a Homeland Security bulletin warning of right wing terrorists and extremists , has led to a lot of hyperbole on the left about how , well , extreme and terrorist-like the right is becoming . And to be sure , there are some nuts who are politically active on the right who should probably be locked up for their own good . But there are plenty of nuts like that on the left as well . A Texas woman faces trial this month in Austin on charges she threatened to kill a government informant who infiltrated an Austin-based group that planned to bomb the Republican National Convention in St. Paul , Minn. , last fall . Katyanne Marie Kibby , 25 , was indicted in June by a federal grand jury in Austin . She is accused of retaliating against Brandon Darby , the community activist-turned-informant who helped federal prosecutors win convictions against Bradley Neal Crowder , 24 , and David Guy McKay , 23 . Prosecutors say the e-mail threat was made Jan. 10 . That was two days after Crowder reached a plea bargain with federal prosecutors in Minneapolis for his role in the plot to build Molotov cocktails and attack the GOP convention in September 2008 . Crowder and McKay were part of a group of activists that had gone to the Twin Cities to take part in street demonstrations . The FBI had infiltrated the group with Darby . Crowder and McKay built eight of the gasoline firebombs but didnt use them , a fact law enforcement officials credited to Darby . Members of the Austin protest community heaped scorn on Darby , saying he had betrayed longtime friends and colleagues . Kibby , who lives in Houston , is free on bond . If convicted , she could face 20 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine . She could not be reached for comment . Whats funny is that , even as this is going on , the left is all atwitter about some gun owners legally carrying their firearms to tea parties in accordance with their 2nd amendment rights . You hear about that endlessly on news outlets like MSNBC , but Ill bet Kibbys name has never been mentioned on the network . Not to mention Crowders name or McKays . As far as Im concerned , violence has no place in American politics right now . I firmly believe that we citizens should embrace our 2nd amendment rights as they were enshrined in the Constitution against a day when , as Thomas Jefferson put it , the tree of liberty will need to be replenished once again by the blood of patriots and tyrants. But that time is certainly not now . And people who plan on firebombing political conventions , or those who beat down peaceful protesters in the streets ( Im looking at you , SEIU ) are tyrants . Not patriots . ''
So ban guns ? That is like curing the headache by cutting off the head . Why not make it a crime to sell a gun privately . Perhaps make it a legal requirement to go to a licensed firearms dealer who at no charge to the parties other than the cost of the background check run the potential buyer through the database . I would certainly be willing to do this . As a responsible gun owner , I would hate to think that the firearm I was going to sell to someone might be going to a felon , or someone likely to use it to commit a crime .
Because A BALANCE needed to be struck ! It does n't go entirely in either direction . We need to balance the right to revolt against an unjust govt . with the problems created when everyone owns assualt rifles and bazookas and we have no registration . Either extreme presents a problem .
`` The advantage of being armed . . . the Americans possess over the people of all other nations . . . Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several Kingdoms of Europe , which are carried as far as the public resources will bear , the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms .

Only a profetallifer would look upon scientific evidence as bias . Then again , there IS a bias here ; it 's a bias in favor of science over sheer emotionalism . We understand that this represents a radical break from the past eight years , but you will just have to adapt .
So Pat is an example of gonadal dysgenesis ( or an intersexual . ) Are you sure it is correct to describe this condition as being `` made-up of two genetically distinct people '' ? Is is not the case that Pat is one genetically distinct person made up of two complete chromosome sets ?
You mean the branch that you and other creationists created as a `` straw man '' when you realised that the pseudo-scientific criticism of evolution was just making you look like XXXXXX ?
So says Wells , who received a Ph.D. in biology despite being a fundy creationist , and is now a fellow at the Disco Institute . Can you believe what this guy is trying to get away with ?
Because the location of the tracks used to be a tidal plane . In other words , it used to be at the edge of the ocean . Around that time the sea coast advanced and receded several times . The tracks were buried . The tracks actually had to be uncovered . The tracks were originally discovered immdiately after an unusually severe storm in the area in which an unusual amount of water came down the Paluxy . That unusual flow of water washed away the soil that covered some of the tracks . Other tracks have been intentionally uncovered . For example , in one case , where a trackway went under a bank , several feet of the bank was removed to expose more tracks .
And I do n't think Doc cares how many points you can dismiss with a one-liner . BTW if you want to comment on fraudulent sources , stop citing the Brady Campaign or the VPC as your excuse for evidence .
Well , again , the best resource I could think of is wikipedia , just do a few searches there ( I suggest starting with `` Human evolution '' ) and I 'm sure most of your questions will be answered . Bear in mind though that even this will only give you a basic overview . If you really want to go in depth , take a college course on evolution . Another good site would be TalkOrigins Archive : Exploring the Creation/Evolution Controversy
That number is for the US . It was available readily in Europe for much longer . As for the number of abortions in the US , they increased when it became legal and since then has been decreasing .
Does n't matter ? If you 're still on your straw man , whatever , if you are referring to an individual pharmacists not servicing based ON religion ( Which is the case in many instances ) , then it 's in black and white as against the law . Regarding firing , if it 's not in the press or if it 's good/neutral press sure , some minority groups do n't get equal treatment under the law , that 's nothing new to America . Yet if it 's national bad press that builds up , no , businesses distance themsleves from such nonsnese . They have on gay rights/health benefits , they will on drugs . Their business is to serve customers , not to promote religious mumbo jumbo . A few companies may indeed choose to not carry , who cares , that 's your straw man . I 'm talking about individual pharmacists in the large chains ( wal mart , grocery stores , etc . ) making a choice based on discrimination , refusal to service an individual .
Because it was found below the K/T boundary , a geologic layer that exists around the world that has been dated by several methods that all agree . So I guess you also reject chemistry and physics , as well as geology . And that does n't even take into consideration astronomy , cosmology and astrophysics .
You want to consider a ZEF a 'person ' - fine , let 's apply this so-called 'logic ' across the board . If a woman should for whatever reason die while giving birth , then the baby should serve a life prison sentence for murder Have a nice day
Well , I ca n't prove that you have an interest to be alive right now . But I would probably ask before I killed you ( not that I am or would ) . So since you do n't believe pro-lifers should be the voice maybe we should ask the fetus , we first have to let it learn how to speak first..so by the point it is born and we ca n't kill it anyway . Not only that , who are you to say they DO N'T have an interest in living ? ? ? I guess you are its appointed speaker now .
So would these liberal firearms owners fail an ethics exam ? `` Even if you gave liberals the answers on an ethics exam , they & # 8217 ; d fail . '' -OldSarge
Actually , it 's not `` different '' at all in that there is nothing in the gay article that is shown wrong or incorrect . So much for your `` obfuscation '' ... And predictably , absolutely NO link from you ... What have you got to hide ?
You just provided good evidence that schools use an atheist presupposition - that atheism is entrenched in public schools . Who proclaims that man and chimps sharing a common ancestor is an established scientific theory ? A theory is defined as a well tested explanation that unifies a broad range of observation . A theory has accepted principles . I know of no religion other than atheism - certainly not the Judeo Christian religion - that believe a creator made the common ancestor that man and chimps share . Since far more than half of US residents believe basically the creation account in Genesis , then there 's not enough unification or acceptance of that `` theory '' . That theory has a presupposition of abiogenesis , or a very similar non scientific basis . Another proof of the atheist entrenchment in public schools would be the organized efforts ( largely of the teaching establishment ) to keep ID out .
Well , since you 've called those who 've disagreed with you here stupid ( and variations thereof ) , and insinuated that they 're too stoned to understand you , I think you have the most ground to make up . You also provide no support for your statements , most of which were debunked years ago as drug czar propoganda .
Yes - drug use is another arena where you , the morality police and big brother can also bugger off . And just like people smoke doobies despite their being illegal - you can bet your XXX I will have an abortion if I ( me , myself , I - not you , Bush the horse or da Pope ) determine it is detrimental to myself and whatever laws you have passed to increase your comfort level and the illusion that you have actually doen anything to help ( a sad misconception ) be damned .
Well since you claim they are I simply do n't believe you . This coming from the one who ca n't use much else than dishonest , biased gun grabber groups . I 'd add you are a waste of time . I pay as much attention to your demands as I do to knat farts . In fact I 'll make it a point to include them . To sum up your own biased gun grabber group is n't sure exactly where the problem is . Yet even they admit to an enforcement problem . The ATF says its straw purchasers . Not gun owners . Yet you insist its honest people not locking guns up . So far your evidence is scanty to non existant at best . You fail to acknowledge the fault of the criminal element in any way . In short eliminate the criminal from the scene and one could stack guns on the kitchen table safely . Its totally the fault of gun owners for failure to secure . You consistantly fail to acknowledge prior restraint being unconstitutional . It has been demonstrated that your storage idea has led to erosion of civil rights in other countries . Not to mention the very real possiblity of it happening here if your scam is followed . From the gunners seat its nitwits exactly like you in legislature that are the real problem . Now run for the bunker to evade the toxic environment . Your storage scam is shot full of holes .
Actually , in regards to possession by felons , they are not petty weapons chargesat least in Virginia . Say for example you catch a crack dealer with a gun . He could get anywhere from a minimum of 5 years up to 40 years for selling crack , but in my experience if he pleads guilty it would be a very , very rare occurrence for him to receive an active sentence of more than 2 years per charge for being a drug dealer . This is because the judge can suspend any part of or all of his sentence , and pursuant to this judicial authority the average sentence I see for per count of selling crack is 12-18 months . But if you catch him with a gun while he is selling , then the punishment for just on offense of having the gun is an automatic 5 years which can not be suspended . I have seen many instances where the defendant gets far more time for having a gun than what he received for the actual underlying crime he commits either with or while having the gun . But to come back to the issue , if registration is aimed at identifying and/or preventing illegal transfers and illegal possession of firearms , then in my opinion that goal can not be reached because it can not be enforced . Felons found in possession are already prosecuted for having the gun without a requirement to register them . A registration requirement will not aid in either their detection or prosecution because they will not comply with the registration requirements command that they incriminate themselvesand no law can force them to register their guns so long as the 5th . Amendment remains a part of the Constitution .
Sure , let 's start with the easy stuff : 1 . We have a fossil record showing how life evolved 2 . We have a growing understanding of DNA showing how life evolved 3 . We have witnessed speciation events 4 . Oh sorry , you only asked for one , did n't you . I got all carried away ...
So , if I whack you in the head with a baseball bat and you become a vegitable , where did your soul go ? If you are still alive and wearing diapers and drooling , is your ability to reason purely `` physical material '' ? How are your brain cells more than the sum of their parts ? If the mind exists as something more than the physical operation of the physical brain , why does it disappear when the brain is damaged ?
They should forgive themselves much quicker . I 'd say , um , like 5 minutes after the abortion procedure . That 's bound to drastically reduce the heartbreak of `` unsuspecting ways '' , internal rot . I 'm laughing with you , I swear !
Please provide evidence that 'there are more fornicators are shacking up ' instead of getting married . Or , is that more of your unsupported claims that you are so fond of . As for perversions , you seem to be very unhealthily concerned with other people 's sex lives .
But the question is Can you prove your belief system is true ? And all you 've done is spew hate for religion but have n't even tried to actually answer the question . And ask yourself this . If the idea of God is such a man made plague , then God does n't even exist right ? So if God does n't exist then what has He done to you to make you so venomous and angry at him ? Why would you be so angry at a non existent being ? I challenge you to come up with a rational answer .
And they are . Happy ?
Nonsense . Almost a billion people are nonreligious .
Yes Joe , please quit trying to impose your way of life on us . The majority of americans are against this sort of behavior , yet you continue to try to impose this aberrant behavior on the rest of society . We dont want any part of it .
Just three months . Man you have to be the best biology teacher in the world . Where did you learn to pull off a miracle like that ?
And a combination of both long and short hair will insulate better than both . That is why so many animals of the Arctic have a combination of both long and short hair . By the way , short wooly hair is a better insulator than long straight hair .
You also make choices when it comes to morality . You say that you value human life , yet you support the death penalty . Presumably , you might support killing the enemy during times of war , you might accept the fact that there is `` collater damage '' during war of innocent civilians , you might support killing in self-defense , etc . There are many balances that are made in our moral choices . Should I start claiming that your standard is getting ever more complicated when it comes to valuing human life ? The abortion debate is a debate about a specific set of circumstances . In those circumstances , I claim that the fetus gets rights to life ( outbalancing the mother 's rights to her own body ) after it can gain mental existence ( around the third trimester ) and you claim that it gains rights from conception on . Outside of that specific set of circumstances then we encounter other considerations and , yes , things get more complicated . In the abortion debate there are only two living beings to consider - the mother and the fetus and their relative rights and value . If you step outside of the abortion debate , then many other things start coming into play , complicating not only the moral picture which I present but the moral picture which you present as well . So , perhaps we should just stick with the debate of this forum - namely , abortion . I am regretting bringing up this thread because it is straying too far afield of the topic of this forum - abortion .
What kind of God creates a world in which rapists , killers , terrorists go free ? Or third world countries in which people are lucky to get one meal a day ?
Ah yes , adopting the Nazi Germany policy of encouraging neighbors to snitch on others , to reward tattle tails for violating the trust of others and invading privacy .
How has the 'convenience ' of a religion disprove the existence of God ? What sociological aspects are you referring to ? Are these the same forces that make anti-religious feeling more 'convenient today ?
The thing is , our technology will be radically different in the future , provided that the conservatives do n't go nuts on us and slow the advance of technlogy .
Though I know you directed this question at Cthulhu , I will nonetheless jump in to say that I would quickly choose the newborn mentally retarded baby to live and the zygote to die . That is obvious to me since the mentally retarded baby is a currently existing person vs. the zygote being merely a potential person . That zygote may have more potential for the future but the decision is being made in the present . I would feel far more guilt in sentencing a real person to die than in sentencing a potential person ( now merely a cell ) to die .
Well , the easy answer is that a lizard did n't evolve an avian lung . There is no known example of a lizard that has an avian lung . However , there is a variety of lung morphologies found in reptiles , including simple sacs in some lizards to the partitioned chambers with intricate support structures in organisms such as monitor lizards and crocodilians . And I am sure that peddler is aware that the crocodilians are the closest living relatives of birds , having arisen from an ancestral archosaur . The dinosaurs , through the ornithodirans , also arose from archosaurs . So the more advanced lung structure may have been ancestral since lizards arose from ancestral diapsids which also gave rise to the archosaurs . So some birds have a system of ( usually ) 9 flexible air sacs that that act as bellows to move air through the lungs . Although the air sacs are not directly involved in respiration , they do have other functions , such as thermoregulation and weight reduction . Extensions of these air sacs have invaded the skeleton and form what are called pneumatic bones in birds . However , there is considerable evidence that this condition occurred in organisms ancestral to birds first . Thus , in the maniraptoriformes it may have been useful in weight reduction in running predators and was retained in birds because the weight reduction was also useful for flight . But some birds , current and fossil , do not have pneumatic bones . For example , Hesperonis lacked them for obvious reasons . But of course , Hesperonis lacked wings useful for flight . Looks like peddler is just a parrot of what his controlers have told him to say . To bad he lacks the integrity to educate himself .
Answer me this , how the hell is an embryo jewish ? Thats like saying my dog is Catholic , or my hair is Buddhist . I do not consider a fetus a sentinent being , therefore no `` Jews '' were exterminated .

Liberalism is Dead ; Long live the Constitution .
I think that what you two are doing is simply trading evidences . Saying someone is 'wrong ' and directing them to a atheist web-site is not proof . You should merely be saying , 'here is an alternative argument ' I say this because I can access a number of science posts that state the exact opposite of what you say , and show that they can find evidence for a flood .

What is it ? Exactly
If it 's not illegal* , it 's not a crime , by definition . Can we stipulate that while it is not illegal in most countries under most circumstances , it is indeed immoral ? *Or the president does it .
And you 're a poor replacement for that koolaid-drinking Seer Travis .
Because that the law one has to presume and of course the law applied to that specific case . As to it being contradictory - well the law is loaded with contradictions if you look at all closely . On the other hand consider that the driver killed the woman AND obviously damaged her fetus beyond recovery - WITHOUT the consent of the woman . In other words the death of the fetus was not by consent of the person who holds the right to decide but rather by the negligence or intent of the guilty party . And yes prior to her death ( assumming all other requirements were met ) she could have AT HER CHOICE and UN-COERCED have chosen to abort the fetus without incurring a legal penalty . But that would of course be much different .
Just because a woman is made to bear children does n't mean she has some God given right to abort her child . I do n't think you can support this view with God 's word . -theo
you 're on the right track ; the problem with evolution is that it has no verifiable creator -- the fact is , mutations ( which supposedly add new raw material for selection ) have never shown to add any new structure or even a new part to any existing structure . It 's a sad fact for evos .
Not everyone reacts to repeated accusations of global scientific conspiracy , incompetence and corruption the same way . You ought to at least consider the possibility that you 're merely being offensive
I 'm posting this here with the hopes that others will add their input in reference to our debate in the Challengers Corner . How long can a self described 'intellectually honest ' person such as yourself ( Iangb ) maintain denial and dismiss without ( aparent ) consideration source after source that proves against your claims ? I claim that 'biologically speaking , a human individual 's life begins at conception . ' I have provided ( among others ) a source from no less than Planned Parenthood which supports my claim . And you not only dismiss the definitions but question Planned Parenthood 's accuracy / conclusions . Frankly , I would like some input from our readers to see if any of them want me to continue belaboring this point .
This is more of a legal question involving whether or not it was negligence ( sp ) . If so , you ca n't really sue for amounts of money you MIGHT get in the future . He could sue for lost pay on the job and other medicial procedures . So ya know . I do n't really know what the question is .
Kudos on the arrogant , hateful stereotyping , wabbit . Ask around . Not all of the `` infidels '' on IIDB are atheists .

Are you too blind and hypocritical to appreciate that your attempts to impose your amoral and unethical world view on we traditional moralists via the legislative activism you participate in , is doing precisely what you are accusing me of doing ? Why is it ok for your side to determine what is right for society but when I offer my vote/opinion , I am imposing something evil on you ? And why do you people constantly assert how tolerant you are and how intolerant we are when you have absolutely no tolerance for our position regarding the immoral and perverse lifestyle you defend ?

Answers This is the result of your secular humanist pop culture which has completely secularized our society and has attempted to erase God and any recognition of his values from our society over the past 50 years . But what is most sad is that you will respond with the opinion that we do n't even have a problem at all . You are completely void of the ability to recognize that we have lost our way morally speaking as a people , and are running to destruction with our fingers in our ears as a civilization . We traditionalists understand very well that we either rise or fall together as a people which is why we still oppose what you represent . But we do n't do it to oppress you at all , we do it to preserve our Nation because God will surely lift His hand from protecting us as we abandon Him and His values which you humanists have worked so hard to erase . But alas , I waste my time even attempting to reason with a spiritually dead secular humanist who has nothing more to respond with but excuses and shallow justifications for your world view !
Yes I do , but because of time restraints and for lack of a better example that everyone could relate to and understand I used it . There are plenty of good examples of where people believe one thing was true while - infact - something else was true , so the point still stands . A better example ( that I probably should have used instead ) is that people used to believe that the Earth was the center of the universe , etc . etc .

That sounds good to me . Although it might be easiest to preserve flow later on it we do n't actually mirror each of our posts once comments arrive ( and inevitably digress ) - just let people quote/cite us from this one if needs be .

Unfortunately Democrats have a credibility problem . Many Pro-gun Democrats have been elected , and America is giving them a chance , but apparently they do not believe Obama because of his past Anti-gun support and votes . However Ms. Feinstein 's comments about waiting for the correct timing to bring up gun control did not help the creditability problem either . I guess only time will tell .
Atheism does n't have that standard because it 's not that encompassing a thought . All athiesm is , is a lack of theism , period . It says nothing about morals or ethics . Your typical athiest , though , looks within to find what 's moral or ethical and it usually just stems from what 's acceptable behavior within the human species . This is also where religion gets its morality and ethics . But times change , and eating shellfish wo n't kill you , and eating meat on friday wo n't make the farmers go broke , so the morals and ethics change to fit the society .

Actually we do not know who the first human to get AIDS was . Most likely it was an African who got it from a green monkey last I looked into the matter , most likely by eating the creature .

Just wanted to repeat that cause it warranted repeating .
If any human attempts to answer in God 's stead , that person would likely not be qualified to answer . One can speculate however . God already had angels within his kingdom when he made man . Some angels felt that God loved his humans more than themselves . In their jealous vanity , they rebelled against God . Bad idea , considering his power and all . God hates vanity . Thus he condemned Satan to rule over hell . When man disobeyed God 's rule concerning partaking of the fruit of knowledge , God made a pact with man that gave him the burden of choice . He must choose right from wrong . Suffer the consequences of bad choices , reap the benefits of righteousness . Satan just happens to be there to take care of those who choose the wrong path . One mistake humans seem to make often is considering themselves capable of understanding the logic of God . Of course if one does not believe in God , no need to worry about it .

Chapter 7.-Whether Even the Remotest Islands Received Their Fauna from the Animals Which Were Preserved , Through the Deluge , in the Ark . There is a question raised about all those kinds of beasts which are not domesticated , nor are produced like frogs from the earth , but are propagated by male and female parents , such as wolves and animals of that kind ; and it is asked how they could be found in the islands after the deluge , in which all the animals not in the ark perished , unless the breed was restored from those which were preserved in pairs in the ark . It might , indeed , be said that they crossed to the islands by swimming , but this could only be true of those very near the mainland ; whereas there are some so distant , that we fancy no animal could swim to them . But if men caught them and took them across with themselves , and thus propagated these breeds in their new abodes , this would not imply an incredible fondness for the chase . At the same time , it can not be denied that by the intervention of angels they might be transferred by God 's order or permission . If , however , they were produced out of the earth as at their first creation , when God said , `` Let the earth bring forth the living creature , '' 25 this makes it more evident that all kinds of animals were preserved in the ark , not so much for the sake of renewing the stock , as of prefiguring the various nations which were to be saved in the church ; this , I say , is more evident , if the earth brought forth many animals in islands to which they could not cross over . St. Aurelius Augustin http : //www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF1-0 ... # P2783_1557226 Further ... from a Q & amp ; A Orthodox site Q A non-Christian person has pointed out what he believes to be a contradiction in the book of Genesis . First , God commanded Noah to take two of every living creature without distinguishing between clean or not clean ones : Gen 6 : 19-20 `` And of every living thing of all flesh , two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark , to keep them alive with thee ; they shall be male and female . Of fowls after their kind , and of cattle after their kind , of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind , two of every sort shall come unto thee , to keep them alive . '' Then , God distinguished between the clean creatures and the unclean as follow : Gen 7 : 2-3 `` Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens , the male and his female : and of beasts that are not clean by two , the male and his female . Of fowls also of the air by sevens , the male and the female ; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth . '' Noah though , took only two of every kind ignoring the second command of God by taking seven of the clean ones as it is stated here : Gen 7 : 8-9 `` Of clean beasts , and of beasts that are not clean , and of fowls , and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth , There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark , the male and the female , as God had commanded Noah . '' A Noah did not ignore God 's commandment but followed it exactly . God 's command to Noah was `` Two of every sort ? . , to keep them alive '' ( Gen 6:19-20 ) Those are the minimum of each species to go in the ark and be kept alive afterwards . Then God gave Noah more specific instructions , to take seven pairs of the clean beasts and of the clean birds . The purpose of this became clear after the flood . The birds were needed to explore the earth ( Gen 8:7-12 ) and the clean animals to be used as sacrifice to the Lord . Noah did not ignore this commandment but the Bible says `` There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark , the male and the female '' If you read this carefully it does not say one pair of each species but that they went in as pairs males and females . If Noah had taken only one pair of each and then offered each of these pairs in sacrifice , these species would have become completely extinct .
And how would you ensure that there are n't any innocent victims of paperwork errors ? Are you gon na have the laws specifically spell this out ?
It 's all very interesting , but you left out a critical piece of information . You deliberately omitted the fact that most of the black victims were killed by fellow blacks . These were n't murders carried out by racist white guys , they 're the examples of black on black violence .
Actually , I 've never known a scientist whose reputation was based on acceptance of some mythical global flood . I ca n't actually remember any scientists who actually expressed an opinion on the topic in a scientific context . I ca n't even imagine a scientist who would actually state that mythology is somehow true in every detail . The concept is ignorant beyond belief .

Oh , and Lurch , God did it .
Because the eyes reveal where someone ( or something ) is looking . Since we have a narrow range of perception this information tells the looker important information about what we are interested in at that time . Note that many animals do n't look into each others eyes ( most herbivours ; since they have near-360 degree vision , eyes convey almost no information ) , and many animals take different information from them than we do ( cats for example take looking at them as hostile behaviour , and narrowing the eyes and looking away as friendly ) .
Actually , natural selection is usefull as well as higher maths . It 's knowledge . If you want to go around like a bumbling fool all of your life ... no , then it 's not useful . Any education is useful and beneficial , given that it 's objective and real -- not fantasy religion . Tons of people use higher math . Engineers , mathematicians , medical field..military ... etc . No , it 's not useful for the common virginia mountain-fur trader . Natural Selection is important in any biological field . To say it 's useless is absurd , for it 's one of the prime foundations for ALL of Biology .
Yes . It is ALL my fault ! So do you use illegal drugs ? All who do are far more responsible than I am ! No illegal drug demand equals no Mexican drug cartel ! How do you feel about abortion ?
And here is the crux of the matter where I think Libertarians are missing it : As one Founding Father said , `` There can be no liberty without virtue . '' Someone else once said , `` Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their bindings '' . If the God of the Bible is right , a nation which legalizes sin and intemperance loses the favor of God . And when the sins of a nation reach their fullness ( in God 's eyes ) , that disfavor can turn to judgment ( Genesis 15:16 , Deuteronomy Chapter 28 - `` The blessings of obedience and curses of disobedience ) . Therefore , while many of the Libertarians mean well on liberal social issues , they nevertheless either do n't see the big picture , or they do n't believe it will occur .
USA Buys Enough Guns in 3 Months to Outfit the Entire Chinese and Indian Army
IF you keep it .
It definitely does not imply an accident . The dictionary defines an accident as an event without appear cause ; mishap . While orderly is defined as being methodically arranged ; tidy . For something to be orderly , or methodically arranged , intelligence must do it . For example , if you go into your room and just mindlessly throw everything around accidentally without planning where it will go , it will not create a nice clean room . No , it will create disorder . Accidents will never create order . Car crashes , for example , do not create order . Think about this , you have bits and pieces of car for over a hundred metres depending on the severity . I'ld hate to be involved in one like that ! If you want your room to look orderly , you must carefully plan where you want to put all of your possessions , where they will look neat and tidy . Hence , intelligence creates order . Therefore , an orderly universe can not come about by accident and thus requires intelligence , i.e . God .
Sure Justine , just like all those gay couples that waited until their state recognized gay marriage to tie the knot on TV . And then once the media got tired of it it 's died down to a trickle in Massachusetts . . . Marriage as a political lobbyists ' tool is n't too sacred IMO .
No . Try agan .
Is English your first language ... Let me take you for a ride on the logic bus ... VoR , You , and the other would be civil rights violators are so certain in your views about guns but are hesitant to put a sign in your window claiming that your home is a `` Gun Free Home '' . Yet you want to take away my personal property all in the guise of public saftey . My very simple point was that a criminal would be much happier breaking into your home than he would mine as he would most likley walk out of your house with a little loot to support his drug habit while in my castle he would be carried out in a body bag all seen on the 6 oclock news for your entertainment ... . My question ( a R h e t o r i c a l one ) was an open question for would be criminals , asking Which house would you rather break into ? Let me ask you this ... If your liberty , your very life is not worth fighting for then what purpose do you have consuming oxygen ? In lifes tennis match which are you ... THe player , or the ball boy ... .
Yes . But if you rephrased the question as `` Does evil exist independent of an observer with a cohesive values system ? `` , I 'd say `` no '' . That an event is regarded as evil requires a values system , but not necessarily theism .
The reason carbon dating is not being used on the remains is that even the most advanced C14 dating methods can only - even in principle - report a date within the last 60,000 years or so . Try to date something older and you 'll get a result , but it wo n't be right . Nor will it be pegged to the 60,000 year end of the scale , like a redlined engine ; it could come back with anything . The fossils in question have been dated via numerous other methods , all of which are in agreement - what the heck is the point of performing another test which you know will yield a 'young ' result even if the fossil is old ? What could such a test possibly tell us ? Apart from the 'horizontally instead of vertically ' part which I did n't understand -
A good starting point is to get educated and be done with it ... .
Yes , time is a factor - the gang is trying to bleed me out . I 'll try to get to it .
That 's the rub : people worshipping the bible as opposed to their god . Fortunately , many people can cope with science being how their god did it .
Just a matter of time .
You can conclude that the odds of happenstance origins are more remote than previously thought . Ruling something out , or considering it less likely by using numbers is a very scientific and logical thing to do .
If theres no proof that its genetic , then how can one say , with any degree of certainty , that it isnt a matter of choice ? The professor attempts to discredit choice by stating there 's no proof it is and promote genetics even without any scientific basis to do so . His selective use of `` lack of proof '' as his main criteria is dubious as a result . Some make the claim that nobody would choose to be gay because of all of the psychological baggage that comes with it . The teasing from straights , the parental pressure , etc. , but we know that rebellious teens will do a lot of anti-social things by choice , so that argument doesnt fly .
He do n't , billsco , and better not try to , imo . If I were to base my job on some religion ( s ) , then I would n't be manufacturing bombs and ammo . But , these people need to check in with their religion a little closer . If they use The Holy Bible as a guide , then they better read it a little closer . The Bible says that if you 're sick , seek a doctor . If you do n't like what a doctor says , go to another . If he gives you a prescription , go get it filled . If Jack 's Drug Store wo n't fill it , go to Ajax Drugs , etc , etc . You ca n't force morality on anyone , anyway . At least that 's what I 've found ... and I do n't do it for a living . On edit : How do you edit a poll ? I meant to click on `` NO '' , but I hit `` Do n't Know '' I feel like one of Bill Cosby 's kids ... .
Power out . That was a link to the American Museum of Natural History in New York . Go back and look later if you want .
yup , those damn libruls harping on about equal rights and other rubbish . Lets force our morality on them , quick !
Because they 're judged to be derivative of the branch that led to us rather than the branches that led to the other apes .
No doubt they call themselves `` pro-lifers '' as well . My ! My ! My ! How easy it is to get a gun in America . And what scaredy cats Americans are if they do n't have their precious guns .
So put the criminals to death , do n't let them see daylight again .
Well , I 'm not seeing it in anything that Montalban has presented . I do n't doubt that it may be possible . I ca n't think of an example , but I accept the possibility that there may be redundant terms . Since both terms carry the same meaning for me , I am not even aware that they exist . I can see how it would be confusing for the uneducated . I can understand how the use of such terms might be a matter of preference or education for any given biologist . More than once another biologist and I have hashed out such terms , only to find that we were talking about the same thing . But such redundancy is so trite that I ca n't remember specific examples . My response tends towards , `` so what ? ''
And just what is the number of `` real scientists '' that acknowledge the good science behind creationist claims ? And why is it that over 99 % of the biologists in the U.S. accept evolution and reject classic creationism ? You make statements that are patently untrue ... ... .
Well , we are doing a pretty good job at refuting evolution with it ! You seem to be a little confused about `` What is science ? '' You have mixed up evolution with science . You see , science is the human enterprise of seeking to describe accurately and quantitatively the nature and processes of our universe through observation , hypothesis , and experimental validation . Note `` the nature and processes '' of our universe . There is no `` origin '' mentioned here , as we can not observe or experiment what would have happened in the past . Evolution is not science , it is just philosophical naturalism , or what you believe in is theistic evolution ( a God guided process of evolution ) . Creation , evolution , theistic evolution ( progressive creation ) are all just different interpretations of the scientific evidence and the sciences.You see , what is the difference between evolution and creation ? Nothing much , only that one takes a long time through naturalistic processes while the other comes around by the special creative acts of God about 6,000 years ago . Does that mean that then , that creation could be regarded as being `` scientific '' ? Everything that creation says , evolution just says the total opposite , while both sides use science to support their case . I hope that you see that both of them are just different interpretations of the scientific evidence that we observe -- different interpretations , same scientific facts , same sciences ( science of genetics , physics , chemistry , etc ) .
And so was n't the universal opinion that homosexuality is unnatural , wrong and to no benefit to Society at all .
Although few mothers would do such a thing , I think that it is clear a mother would have the same right to do this as with a world-famous violinist . The fact that we would disapprove of such a women is not really important : emotive reactions do n't constitute proof . If they did , the writer could simply say : 'I think women who have abortions are terrible ' and his job would be done . I 'm dubious about the whole human rights basis of much modern debate on issues like abortion - I support neither the premises , reasoning or conclusion of the violinist argument . But this whole counter-argument seems to me extremely weak .
Well , that 's what I was doing too : - ) This was something that flashed into my mind one morning and I ran with it , posting it almost immediately , working through it all as I was typing . It 's not something I 've spent months on previously and had all possibilities covered : I was wanting others to take a look and see if they found a gaping hole I overlooked . I 've gotten your ( tentative ) agreement , and no counters that actually refute my reasoning , so I may move on , using this as a premise for my next step in a larger 'logical argument ' .
Actually , it does n't . Perhaps you could try learning some new information rather than just making things up for other people to believe . The concept of information , which you have chosen not to define for the transparent reason of employing a shifting definition , is not typically employed by biologists . A mutation is what it is , regardless of whether you define what it contains as `` information '' or not . Perhaps you 'd like to get into insisting that information `` requires a sender '' now , we 've all heard it before .
Yeah , but then they 'd have to admit that the reason it was done to a `` heterosexual family '' is because that family was black , interracial , Jewish , or some other object of prejudice . And there is no way they would admit that comparison ...
You yourself said you do n't even know what the gun laws in California are . Yet you 're saying there you believe they have legitimate tests ?
A curse ? If you do n't agree with it that 's one thing . Many people have died because of Christianity . The Crusades killed many people just for not converting to Christianity . Gallileo was arrested for proposing the Earth revolves around the sun which was against the church . Atheism has n't ever hurt anybody . And you call atheism the curse ?
But Oswald did not shoot Kennedy . He was just a patsie . He shot at Keneddy but missed of course . Also , Lincoln was Republican an Kennedy a Democrat .
Hi NATO , I agree that irresponsible industrial pollution is damaging the environment and would never deny that at all . Acid Rain which is a side effect of air pollution has polluted more lakes , streams and rivers than direct dumping has and that is a direct result of heavy metals and other toxins being spewed into the atmosphere by industrial smoke stacks . So this reality goes without saying in my opinion . But environmental pollution is very different than extending the claim to the next level of Global Warming which implies that the worlds atmosphere is now incapable of repairing itself . That is the crux of this argument and if the atmosphere were so polluted that the Earth was unable to repair itself , then the air quality here in NH would be as polluted as it is in China and Russia even though we have no industrial air polluters at all to speak of here . That would be solid evidence that the volume of pollutants in the atmosphere is overwhelming the Earths ability to repair itself . But our air quality is pristine in comparison to any and all third world countries who are the largest polluters due to their lack of having any industrial pollution safeguards in place . So we must make the distinction between environmental pollution and air pollution clear because the Global Warming fraud is based specifically on the claim that air pollution is changing our weather and warming the planet , since all of the scientific evidence belies that claim .
Well in the opinion of supporters of that theory there has been evidence for their beliefs ... Visions , UFO 's , ... even though it is very doubtful , it would have to be respected in classes at school ...
No one said otherwise and it is still irrelevant .
I believe it 's you that has n't been paying attention . This Democratic Congress had a recent approval rating of 9 % , IIRC .
Who has ever made this claim ? Please , show me , because I have never once heard it . Of course most individuals are physically capable of producing offspring . Natural selection is dependant upon which individuals will pass their genetic information on to the next generation , and that is determined by at least two factors that I can think of at the moment : 1 . ) An individual being able to survive long enough to find a mate , and 2 . ) Actually being able to find a mate and produce offspring , which brings me to my next point :
Bad , bad , bad . 1 ) Reducing meat consumption will create a change towards more agricultural farming which is more sustainable for humans and the environment . 1 ) Some , perhaps all `` Livestock feed '' is actually edible for humans ; GM maize is regularly consumed in the US and Mexico . 2 ) One does not have to consume those foods as there are thousands of plant foods that can be eaten .
Thank You . You know how much I love to impress people .
Have faith and the problem will go away ...
You know what is far worse than murder itself ? Executing people to save some money .
? ? ? It just happened recently in Maryland
Not if you work for my company . Random drug testing . Counciling after first failed test , gone after the second . No ifs , and or buts .
I know a miriad of gay couples who would corrupt it signifigantly less than Brittney .
So you admit there is NO scientific evidence of any theory of creation . Thanks .
There all types of denominations of the Catholic religion . However , most religions that I consider `` Christian '' are really not the same as `` Catholic . '' Catholicism tends to be even more strict and loony than Christianity .
And what 's more , the huge numbers of uninsured are getting their health care for free - at least what they get . An uninsured person brought in to an emergency room with a heart attack is a total loss to the hospital and the doctor . Maybe it would have been cheaper to get that poor soul high blood pressure pills . Where do you think the money comes from for his hospital stay ? Our pockets too in the form of higher costs to those who can pay . There 's no free ride for any of us .
Well , an abortion ca n't technically be called 'fetal homicide ' because it is n't illegal ... homicide is . If a woman kills her toddler , that is homicide , and it is n't legal , and I do n't see how it ever could/would be ... all murder is illegal , but to call an abortion murder is really only your personal opinion on the issue , because as of now it is a legal procedure . Some people consider it to be murder , and some don't.. it is n't an open and shut thing either way ; if it were , there would n't be so much debate over it , and if it were considered to be murder all around , no questions , then it would not be legal . Maybe the laws will change someday , who knows.. but right now it 's not illegal for a woman to have an abortion . You can call it a double standard , but again that is mainly just opinion . But I also have had friends who have had abortions because they did n't want to 'get fat'.. I know of one girl who had 7 by the time she was 22 ... that is pretty disturbing , and I do n't think that it 's really right to do it for reasons like that ... like I said to her , if she were so afraid of getting pregnant , or getting 'fat ' , she should have either not had sex or she should have used protection ... there are ways to prevent pregnancy , and birth control costs a hell of a lot less than an abortion ( especially 7 times ) .. but at the same time I also had a friend who got pregnant , and got scared , and made an appointment to a clinic , and once she got there she did n't think she could go through with it , and now she has a healthy , adorable 5 year old and she is very thankful that she did n't have the abortion after all ... but in the cases of my friends , all I could do was offer an opinion if they asked , but I did n't feel I had the right to tell them what to do either way . You really ca n't know what is going on in a woman 's mind when she is considering an abortion , or after she has had one done .
Which , as stated , Darwin thought was in fact a better phrase , or 'more accurate ' ... `` But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer , of the Survival of the Fittest , is more accurate , and is sometimes equally convenient .

It will either be killed after the election or it will be voted up then killed at the next ConCon in 2007 .
I know ... .. I 've wondered from time to time exactly what this improbability is . I mean most of us would find the probabilities of dealing a given sequence from a deck of 52 card pretty `` improbable '' . I guess its best to avoid those tricky fact things and stick to words only .
I believe white supremacists hate all non-whites , not just blacks .
Oh both sides arguing have played dirty ... .
Would n't it be nice if you actually made an effort to learn what you are talking about . My bet is that I am as moral as you . One of the most respeted biological authors of our day is a devout Christian . How rude and insulting for you to claim that only your version of Christianity is correct . How pompous can you be ?
Well I replied to this same post a couple months ago , but I would like to respond with a new perspective I have on it now . Basically the basics of the US government is that it is to secure our rights and our safety , so that we do n't live in a state of anarchy , where the biggest strongest man wins . If a power is n't given to the government , they may not use it . The bill of rights is an even further prohibition of regulation . To make a law based on firearms or anything they have to have a reason for doing it , and the federal government may not be involved unless the Constitution grants them the right to ( it does n't mention guns in the powers it gives the US government ) . The 2nd amendment is restricting the government ( federal , states , and local governments ) from infringing upon that right . But the question still arises , what is meant by the mysterious militia clause ? There are many interpreations on this but I think the basic meaning of this is so that a similar thing could happen as did in the American revolution . But then an even bigger problem arises . If that purpose is to be left intact we need to allow the citizens to access the same weapons the government has . But I really do n't feel comfortable allowing citizens with atomic bombs and such . This is really a problem . Also , obviously if this were meant to be a tool for a revolution , would n't concealed weapons also be covered ? Again it seems that it is currently impossible to follow the intentions of the amendment . Many will use the quote `` Those that sacrifice liberty for safety deserve neither '' , but this is a hollow argument . The whole purpose of government is that we give up some of our natural liberties ( the liberty to kill someone ) for personal safety and protection of our other rights ( the right to life ) . I agree you can not go too far , but where do we draw the line ? I do n't like the idea of an oppressive government owning all the weapons or do I want them available to the worst criminals , so that instead of handguns and regular bombs , they are using uzies and atomic bombs ? Do you have more trust in the government or in the general public ? That 's a hard question to answer because I do n't have much trust in either one , therefor I seem to be undecided on where to really draw the line . As you can see , my opinion on this matter has changed drastically over the past few months , mostly because of this site ( see , ideas really can change minds ) , so please do n't tell me how I 'm contradicting myself here .
Whoah ! Ohmigawd ! You talk about your historical illiteracy ! Some little peabrains have never assimilated the knowledge that until rather recently IT WAS QUITE COMMON TO ABANDON UNWANTED INFANTS IN THE WILDS TO FEED THE BLOODY WOLVES AND SUCH ! IN FACT , IN OLD ROME THE RIGHT OF PATERFAMILIA INCLUDED THE RIGHT TO PASS JUDGMENT ON NEWLY BORN INFANTS IN HIS FAMILY , WOULD THEY BE WELCOMED INTO THE FAMILY OR EXPOSED ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Do I have to explain to the various peabrains what the term `` exposed '' means ?
And with strict gun control laws too . Wow , who would 've believed such a thing were possible .
But the modes have changed , grown and expanded with time . First it was the FEET , then the wheel was invented . Not the other way around . There is a wide range of choices when it comes to transportation . Cars are not the be all and end all .
No we should not kill the sick and dieing . But when you need medical care in the last 10-15 years of their lives there is a reason . Old age , disease , accident , using drugs ( and yes tobacco is a drug ) , etc.. That goes with life . Have you ever stepped on an ant ? That is a life form Squashed a spider , Eaten a chicken , wear leather ? And to say a fetus is a life how can you eat eggs ? A fetus becomes a baby the baby becomes a adult and the adult becomes the elderly . A chickens egg becomes a chicken or breakfast . Why not defend the egg ? We kill animals for luxury of their skin ( leather ) Not to keep warm but for the look and feel only . If life is that important that we dictate it is at conception why not defend all life . Animals included .
I would call a fossil that had both reptillian and avian features a strange creature that God created at the beginning of time . What about platapuses ? They have a duck 's bill and yet they live mostly underwater . Are they a link from ducks to mammals ? Are bats a link from rats to birds ?
youre more concerned about those 22 to 30 thousand gun laws but Im more concerned about the 22 to 30 thousand lives taken by gun violence each year and when youre dead guess what ? then BANG ! you dont have anymore rights protected by the bill of rights because youre dead so if youre really pro american and pro bill of rights then you should worry more about getting good gun control laws passed to protect peoples lives so they can enjoy their rights without having to worry about being shot and losing all their rights maybe youve just been decieved and dont understand what youre supporting
Again you have nowhere to go without anything to start ... so your hypothesis has no weight .
Ah the non human part .
As I understand , Scalia and Thomas are some of the most conservative members of the court .
You do n't view infants as people either ? What form of beast are you ?
No one insists they are `` descendants '' . No one insists they are ancestors either . Rather , they are viewed as an offshoot of the branch that led to H. sapiens sapiens ( i.e.-us ) . Just like your cousins are neither your ancestors or your descendants .
And , if he is perfect , and perfection can not arise spontaneously , did he create himself with his own thoughts ? Alternatively , did he come into existance at the beginning of time ? In that case , what created time and God ? Otherwise , if God and time have gone back forever , why did he wait forever before creating the earth ?
Some in S Africa do not think their gun laws are strict enough . Some in New york city do not think THEIR gun laws are strict enough . This just shows that there are XXXXXX everywhere . In S Africa , you are required to have a permit to own any firearm . Any criminal activity , or `` questionable '' associations result in the refusal of a permit . Over 60 % of permit applications are denied , and penalties for posession of an unlicensed weapon are severe . YET , unlicensed weapons outnumber licensed ones . The problem with gun control laws is that they seldom contain a crime control element . Somebody who is going to rob a liquor store is not likely to stop and rethink their plan because their firearm is illegal . They are getting ready to commit a felony anyway . Nobody is going to decide NOT to murder somebody because they fear being charged with illegal posession of a firearm . Gun laws essentially only apply to law abiding citizens . A criminal is , by definition , somebody who does not obey the law . You can not legislate away criminality .
I 'm not going to even mention how perilous common sense is . I 'm confused by your statements about all animals having brains and consiousness . Your first assirtion is wrong because some organisms , like sponges and jellyfish , do not require a centralized nervous system . Your second assertion is nonesensical and incorrect according to classic Christion dogma . You have no definition for consiousness so potentially even plants have some , making your assertion meaningless . Animals would all have enough consiousness to do what they needed to fill their niche , and this would be caused by slow natural selection , not by holy edict . By the way , most pastors I 'm familiar with would tell you animals do n't go to heaven because they are both soulless and lack conscious thought . As to you stating God gave animals the ability to change to their environment , do you have evidence of massive bodily changes ? Tell your assertion to the millions upon millions of species that have gone extint in Earth 's history because of changing enviroments or more powerful competition .
But in both situations , there are things that an individual can do to reduce the risks of bad things happening . There are also things that can not be done in either situation to completely eliminate risk . I already mentioned that there is a genetic component to heart disease . My entire point has essentially been that human beings do n't always deal with risk in entirely realistic ways .
And not one of these geniuses has even attempted to deal with the meat of my argument but will go around the edges of what I say looking to create disputes on terminology and senseless minutia . Anything to derail the thread .
So you 're saying there are vastly more abortions in the world than there are births ?
fossilized bone gets carbon dated all the time !
Yes , I know all about Dr Dino . He is a fraud and con .
And I submit they will continue to ignore it completely as they focus on anything but that issue .
Well , if they were armed , one of the pirates could possibly be injured . I dunno . I wonder if Mr. and Mrs. Chandler have ever heard of Munir Hussain ? I hope they are following the advice the British government has given Myleene Klass . `` Do n't defend yourselves ! You might injure an attacker ! ''
A nonsensical concept . Genetic change is genetic change . Evolutionary theory does n't contain any concept of progress . Only scientific illiterate creationists try to insist that it does .
But that is n't even what we are debating . Your debating that God changed his mind . I 'll grant you that since he changed his mind in the prophecy directly before this one . What we are debating is the fact that the Bible has a flaw in it . The prophecy before this one was incorrect . A correction was made later to make up for this . Then this prophecy was incorrect . There is no correction ever made . Hence there is a flaw in the Bible . Most Christians will accept the Bible as flawless and this single flaw could have the power to change minds and make people question how a perfect God allowed the only proof of him to be flawed . So if you are correct that God did change his mind , then you have to also accept that my point has been made and that there is a flaw in the Bible . You can downplay this flaw but it is still there for all to see . To expand on some of what you said , do n't you think what you detailed there would go against what most Christians believe about God ? You 're saying that he used trickery and lies to accomplish goals . God works in mysterious ways , but in devious ways ? I do n't know how willing Christians would be willing to accept that . PS - I really do n't want to lead this topic in a new direction , but I do n't think your really explaining Christian principles in much of your response . Your ideas would probably be shunned by the majority of Christians and your insistences that 'it 's true ' as far as your writing goes is a little too cocky . I hope you will write a post concerning some of these issues and explain whether you feel like you fit into the role of the typical Christian or if you have your own and original ideas about God and/or the Bible .
Ok , this does seem like one of the weaker arguments as to why there is no evidence for god but its like this Some peoples idea of god is all loving , and all knowing and well you know . But if that were the case we would expect there to not be things like pain and suffering . Granted , we may not actually be able to know his grand design , and how this pain is actually necessary but it just goes against my reasoning . I guess I could take their word for it that its part of Gods plan but since they dont know his plan either that isnt very comforting and hardly positive evidence . It also gets me wondering how they dont know how gods design work , however they do know god has certain qualities . ( but thats neither here nor there )
First off , all equally arbitrary does n't mean they are all valid . If I made a mistake let me clear that up now Secondly , you still have an arbitrary system going there . The idea that many people believe something does n't make it true . Furthermore , your observations still make several assumptions that in fact are proclamations . Obviously people have come to observe different things from you ... all of which ca n't be proven ( in the sense we mean it ) and all of which are abitrary .
I think you are mis reading what he said . His statement is more about preparedness than seeing threats everywhere . I think the paranoia fits with the anti gunners more so than the gun owner . The anti gunner sees every gun owner as a threat . Where the gun owner doesnt see a threat but prepares for one

Abortion is about pregnancy - and whether or a not a woman wants to be or can sustain a pregnancy - physically , emotionally and economically . Nobody has to be a parent . That is why there is adoption , safe-haven laws , the signing away of parental rights - and oh yes , an ever growing population of dead beat dads . I am still waiting to see proof of all the mourning dads due to women having abortions . Most of those women are desperate and alone - or have the blessing of the father .
But it increases the population in and overpopulated world .
You can check the statistical relationship between dozens of variables , not the effects of them . For example if I correlated left hand strength with right hand strength across a billion individuals I would probably find a correlation of about 0.93 , however this relationship is not causal , cutting off one hand will not result in a 90 % strength reduction in the other . Correlational studies like this one can not determine cause and effect .
Very sad news . I 'm gon na have to say that if I was talking to the assemblyman that they quoted said that to my face , I 'd tell the little bigot that his filthy viewpoint sounds exactly like the arguments used against interracial marriage , against civil rights for blacks , women , and various minorities , and also against ending slavery .
The documents contained in the bible are historical artifacts . They reflect the beliefs and values of the people who wrote them . When we read Paul we might not believe everything he says but overall we can believe that he preached a gospel that Jesus was born , crucified , died , and risen . We can discern his message from the 7 or so letters we know of his . We can generally believe that he met people named Peter , James , and John who were `` reputed to be pillars '' and `` seemed to be important . '' We know that he claimed his knowledge of Jesus came through revelation and scripture and claimed that other apostles had similar sources of knowledge . I think we can trust Paul 's claims on these things . Do we need to believe he really had revelations ? I do n't know . Maybe in his own way he did . I think we need to lean toward Paul believing in the truth of his claims . I would think the court would think very dimly of the hearsay claim that 500 anonymous people had a revelation of the Risen Christ .
Those cultures that permit multiple wives at least do have issues as a result , but hard to say they fail miserably . We are complex animals and not all animals mate for life . There is significantly more involved in the lifelong union of humans than reproduction . Multi-marry under the right circumstances works , but it is n't for everybody and even for those that it is for does n't mean it 's for them always . In a nutshell marriage is the biggest commitment any person will make and should be given the consideration and thought it deserves . Same sex marriage can cause a perfect union of two people the same as M/F and can make a mockery or marriage just as many M/F unions currently do . The emotional investment is the same , the responsibility and obligations are the same , the only difference is genitalia and a little more hair in some cases .
Not with you Mr. Muddy Waters .
Let 's hear it . How could mutations and natural selections produce the changes necessary and how could the intermediate be viable ? There are lots of problems , it is not plausible . It is not possible .
So you are saying that we determine our DNA ? Do you actually think before typing ?
And yet no other portion of lotts work has been refuted . His methodology has been scrutinized and found to be legitimate . YET , you are willing to completely disregard his work because of an unrelated comment ?
But they do . There are lots of schools that teach creation right where it should be taught . The teach it in courses of comparative religion ( which may be what you are talking about above ) or in classes of mythology . They teach Hebrew mythology right along with Greek and Roman mythology as well as others . But your religion is n't science . Why ca n't fundamentalist christians teach their religion in their homes and in their churches ? Why do they insist that our government should teach their religion to everyone by force ?
You said who would it hurt ? I 'm asking you who would it hurt if there was prostituion ? Just to help you think that there are injuries that are proximate to everyone .
Well you think wrong . The Second Amendment is individual , it 's tied to all lawful uses of firearms , and the game is over . You lost .
And yet you can offer nothing to show it 's impossible ! It most certainly is a plausible explaination ! Fairytale ? ! ? Do n't think so , a logical path for the developement of the avian lung .
Well , maybe the pistol and the hunting rifle , what do you need an automatic weapon ? Have the deer gotten faster ?
I would suggest you look at the faero island mouse then . That is a new species , and it is not man doing it , but rather nature itself .
See , here is the example of how..out of touch you are . Of course it could be dangerous . I have not only been gay bashed once , but twice in my life . The first time coming out of a bar when I was in my early 20s . I was beaten by five guys with baseball bats . My head swelled 3 times it 's size and I was out cold for 4 days . I had `` nike '' imprinted into my skin from the bottom of their sneakers . The second time , I met a friend for dinner at a local bar . We met at about 7pm , had a drink and as we left the bar to go to a diner I was body slammed by two college kids running down the street . Broke my collar bone and was knocked out . When the owner of the bar came out he asked ... do you think this was a hate crime . We have been having some problems . The world is not a safe place for gays and lesbians . We never know when we will be someplace where we could be assulted . You , jyoshu , live in dreamland when it comes to gays and lesbians . That has been shown to those of us here in the board a thousand times over . YOu understand so little of what being gay is about .
is n't it a good feeling wake up , log on to the internet , and see your theory smoked ?
They do not . They offer increased thermal protection and thus make a greater range of habitats possible . Feathers also offer increased protection from attack . They are so good that several native American cultures were known to make armor from feathers . They absorb and spread impact quite well . Feathers do n't itch and they do n't rustle in the bush . Do you have an answers that are n't examples of shallow thinking ?
But it does have an answer , as long as ( and I see no reason to infer otherwise ) 'organisation ' is defined , as are many scientific concepts , as a human-imposed description of the sum of a multitude of physical cause/effect phenomena . Remember when we argued about entropy ? I essentially stated ( or admitted , if you want to see it that way ) that the concepts that we label 'entropy ' , 'order ' , 'disorder ' and even 'particle ' are human-imposed abstracts applied for ease of understanding . Again referencing a point I have previously made , the maths that backs up the areas of physics ( which necessarily includes chemistry/biology ) that are confirmed with near-certitude , is equally as-certain-as-possible , but is impossible to satisfactorily translate into ordinary language ; hence the terms employed that , relative to the maths , are so vague and easily misinterpretable . My best example is the uncertainty principle , which can be explained in words , but can only be shown to be an uncontrevertible fact by using maths . The great thing about the UP is that it is not even necessary to perform a real experiment ; given certain parameters ( already known ) the UP is inevitable . The POV I am justifying here is one that does not even begin to reference such terms as 'organisation ' and what may 'drive ' it . This may be a personal thing , but ideally IMHO the scientific method should never assume 'organisation ' or 'drives ' , it should only look at facts and figures . After this analysis has been done mathematically , there may ( and indeed always are ) patterns discernible that we , humans , can label 'organisation ' and 'drives ' , but these things do not exist in and of themselves . They are abstracts , simplifications , words used so that we do not have to talk in complex equations . Given all this , when we come to the Four Fundamental Forces , we do actually know ( ie we are almost certain ) that these phenomena are a part of the world of facts and figures , not part of the world of human-imposed concepts . My best supporting argument for this is that the FFFs can not ( yet ) be further reduced to anything simpler . There are plenty of other 'forces ' such as kinetic energy , potential energy etc that derive their very existence from the FFFs . The FFFs are anything but non-material , as they are intermediated by known , defined , observed particles/quanta or in the case of gravity , the medium of spacetime . The only confusion comes when trying to determine `` What is a particle ? What is spacetime ? '' Regardless of the answers , surely we have to assume that particles and spacetime are material , for if not , then nothing is .
I think Peddler and Ray have lots of good ideas , and they will be able to explian everthing . Just give them a chance ! Stop bothering them with more questions so that they can actually concentrate on one of them instead of getting loads more . Sheesh !
The VAST majority of abortions occur within the first trimester . Abortions at 21 weeks and over are pretty rare .
Because they do n't morph . But on the other hand , speciation has been observed . We have seen hawthorn maggot flies speciate several times as additional suitable plants have been introduced to the U.S. We have seen strains of laboratory flies speciate several times such that none are able to interbreed with the parent species anymore . We have observed two species of gulls that share a common range and do not interbreed , except that they are the extreme ends of a single population the encircles the world .
Funny you did n't mention the Fort Hood shooting . Why ? Meanwhile 40 people were senselessly murdered at a wedding in Afghanistan . 40 dead in blast at Afghanistan wedding - CNN.com Top that .
Hetero or not is irrelevant . Society over the millenia has set up the institution of marriage which set up as being between people of opposite genders . You are of course entitled to persuade people to change the concept .
And where does the 'Theory of Evolution ' say that Man came from monkeys ? That is a very inaccurate statement . Perhaps you do not accept evolution because of lack of information ? What the theory of evolution states is that monkeys and apes came from a common ancestor , and that humans are apes from a taxonomy point of view . While there are 'gaps ' in knowledge , I suspect if you did a study about what we actually do know about evolution , and human evolution in specific , you would be amazed at what we DO know .
Ah , the classic macroevolution attack . http : //www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/ http : //www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB901.html Huh . Guess you 're wrong .
Well , it might be hard to convince people that you are n't ignorant of some of the facts , although it appears that you 're not completely ignorant of all of the facts ... On the other hand , only Christians might label you as `` anti-Christian '' for rejecting literalism .
I keep a fire extinguisher in my house , and I keep it full . That does n't mean that I 'm expecting my house to burn down . I 'm just ready for it .
Well Clive , I will formally invite them here ... ... .. I do n't know if any of them will take my invitation seriously , but we will see .
And you have n't proven that you do n't support the idea of obligatory lobotomies for all redheads . The question is why have you accused me of being in support of a dictatorship without a shred of evidence ? Smiley
And you 've never hesitated to make it sound like we want to do away with law , when in fact , we 're just pointing out that criminals wo n't follow them if they 're passed .
But then of course nearly every idea not your own generates a DUH from you . As in DUH why use data .
I think often abortion is wrong but I do not agree with criminalizing it . Primarily the reasons that are used to justify criminilzation are hugely fallacious and secondarily because it wo n't do a thing that is positive . A woman who is determined to end her pregancy - will . Criminalization will simply make it extremely dangerous . I am responsible , have even had my tubes tied , but if I were to become pregnant and that pregnancy were the result of rape or a threat to my health or livlihood I would end it - and I will not be checking the law books first . Every woman has her line in the sand - abortion will go on regardless of its legal standing . There are a miriad of reasons seek abortion - comdemning those reasons does nothing ( i.e . calling them selfish ) - addressing them could help . The reasons are valid .
Just like the plastic gun fear , the armour piercing bullet fear was built upon misinformation and myth .
oh please now you are just being dramatic . But for the sake of argumnet . NO marriage should be two consenting adults .
OK you have convinced me high capacity magazines are the root cause of crime . Senator Feinstein , she has a concealed weapon permit and is licensed to carry a gun .
I know and I would say they are wrong also . I may be overly enthusiastic , but I do believe people can disagree and still be civil .
Your lie about me is duly noted .
That has to be a typo my friend . If you can compress the EB into only 1012 bits then you can write your own ticket in the field of data compression ! Lets see 100 million pages into 1012 bits - fantastic - please tell us how . I really would like to put the entire literature of mankind ( and more ) on an Ipod .
say what ? i am just saying that i can tell you are a good person .
Because they knew full well that the bulk of the confiscated weapons never came from the United States ! I do n't see why we should care how many weapons could n't be traced back to America even though they came across the border , because it 's a moot point . The identifying marks do n't exist on them if they ca n't be traced , meaning the whole thing is a non-issue for everybody except those who have an axe to grind and rights to try and destroy .
of course he says `` might '' , science always tentative . any time you see something along the lines of `` it happened this way '' there is always an implied , but unseen `` probably '' between the `` it '' and the `` happened '' . Look ... you made a comment about how Dawkin 's observation that the eye is flawed is actually support ID because it actually justifies a creationist 's argument that it 's ok to look for well designed aspects . I responded by putting your accusation in context ( He was criticizing Paley , and he never actually used this as evidence , just showing that it could go both ways ) . Now you go off on a tangent about how dawkins logic is flawed , and how behe 's logic is accurate ... i do n't want to get into that because , both dawkins and behe 's make much better arguments themselves ( anyone reading , go out and get these books behe is much more technical and raises some questions that must be answered , however makes ( imo ) some unwarranted conclusions at the end of his book . Dawkins is much less technical , however provides logical reasoning as to why evolution is possible and how it works ) but i do want to point out that while this is an example of 2 different interpretations ( good/bad designs in the eye ) given the same thing , it is NOT used as any kind of scientific proof of anything . opinions are not objective scientific evidence because they are subjective .
It was a joke .
Judge challenges backers of gay marriage ban - Crime & amp ; courts- msnbc.com It 's funny . I have been making these types of comments FOR YEARS to refute that pathetic attempts trying to give a constitutional justification for why the government should be able to discriminate against gay marriage . People have scoffed at the constitutional requirements of equality , but FINALLY somebody is addressing it . Now I guess the question remains as to whether enough people like Scalia will be on the bench to ignore it ... On another note , it 's also interesting to see the anti-gay side taken to task . They casually toss out accusations that gay marriage somehow harms straight marriages or society without justification . Some like Jyoshu actually toss out such arguments , and then try to ignore the existence of such arguments ... And now that argument is getting scrutinized by the courts and is being taken to task . The anti-gay side performed pathetically . I expect the right will have the typically mindless accusations of `` judicial activism '' while ignoring the fact that upholding the constitution is one of the main duties of the courts ...
You do n't see how gun-control interferes with self-preservatlion ? Hmmmm ? OK , simple . I want to defend myself with a handgun . I really ca n't if I do n't have one do I . Sure you can defend yourself in a gun free society such as Canada . I want to defend myself with a gun when the felons only have knives . I really ca n't do that if I do n't have a gun do I . Your responsible for your own protection , not me .
Yes , but reason and dogma are not the same standard .
But she murdered her child . There are laws in Austrailia ( and hopefully someday in the U.S. ) against killing your pre-birth children .
So what 's the deal here ? California wo n't even trust its own officers to do the concealed carry thing , and that 's considered a reasonable way of doing things ?
Replicating molecules and lipid membranes have arisen spontaneously in the lab . Functioning viruses have been created from the correct sequencing of nucleic acids . Besides , what are you talking about ?
The hypothesis of a mitochondria Eve is about 17 years old and has been shown to be wrong . In addition your statement that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human populations makes clear you did not understand the concept behind mitochondria Eve to begin with .
And still more :
No . Holy Scripture is Gods Word .
Yes and can you see there is so many things that are consensual liek polygamy , under age sex , prostitution .
So everything that other people say on a website or in a book is just and opinion ? And everything you say is a fact ? Nice how you 've got things set up .
But , but , but , how would you ever be able to prove your point that armed citizenry can not protect themselves ? Even absent the myriad court cases that prove police have no duty to protect anyone ? Allowing citizens to be armed sans bullets is the only way to help make the criminals more safe and the armed citizen at risk . Their motto must surely be , `` never give a sucker an even break '' ? Instructors teach `` if you have a fair fight with a perp , your tactics suck !
Possibly , depends on what you read and by whom . Still , the war was n't aganist slavery .
I would also like to see women choose and want to have their babies instead of terminating their pregnancies , as long as they are able to handle the responsibilities of having a baby or are able to handle the possibility of passing on those responsibilities to someone else - via adoption , having a relative bring it up , etc . Though I have n't experienced it myself , I can well imagine that having a child can be a wonderful experience . However , I believe that there are many instances where having a baby would pose very grave difficulties . Some of these might include : - The woman might not be able to financially afford to have another child . This may be a parent who already has too many mouths to feed and would reduce the health and life opportunities of the other children if she had more children . It may be a young single woman of poor job prospects who may have no recourse but to fall back on welfare , whereas , if she waited to have children until she would be older and more prepared , she could be a better mother to those future children . - The community in which the woman lives might be extremely negative about unmarried woman having children so both she and the baby would suffer that stigma , whereas , if she secretly got an abortion , she could maintain her reputation and have children in marriage later on in a much better social environment . - Of course , there are the cases of rape , incest and a threat to the life of the mother , but I think we mostly agree on those . I think that women are generally able to decide for themselves when it would be too hard for them to have a baby , so I believe that women should have the right to choose ( at least during the first and second trimester ) - especially since it is her body that is so intimitely involved in the process . Yes , theoretically , they could put the child up for adoption , but giving a child up for adoption poses many difficulties for the woman , including the stigma and guilt associated with giving up a child . I applaud those women who are able to handle that stigma and give another couple the opportunity to adopt her baby , but I would not dream of forcing her into that decision . Unfortunately , though a lot of progress has been made in recent decades , there is still some social stigma left against those who give up children for adoption and against those who choose single motherhood ( marriage is not always a possibility ) . Reduce that stigma and you might reduce the number of abortions .
I believe that explains everything very well . `` Gun free zones '' are nothing more than `` sheep for the slaughter '' and `` wholesale massacre '' locations that violent and murderous individuals flock to .
I believe in that which is . Because to believe in anything else is ultimately pointless .
